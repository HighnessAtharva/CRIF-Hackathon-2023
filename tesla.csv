Elon Musk isn’t serious about giving power to a new CEO,"Elon Musk says that he’ll still be in charge of Twitter’s software and server teams after he resigns his CEO seat to “someone foolish enough” to take the job. In a recent poll, Twitter users voted in favor of him stepping down.",2022-12-21T01:57:28Z,https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/20/23520019/elon-musk-stop-twitter-ceo-software-server-teams,Elon Musk said Tuesday that hell still be in charge of Twitters software and server teams after he resigns his CEO seat to someone foolish enough to take it. He broke the news in a response to a poll he ran earlier this week where around 58 percent of respondents said that he should step down as CEO. Given that the social networking site is mainly made up of software and servers especially after the massive layoffs its clear Musk will still have direct control over the company even if he doesnt have the explicit CEO title. Thats not necessarily a surprise Musk has defacto control over product at most of his companies and hes still Twitters owner at the end of the day. But the announcement likely means disappointment for anyone hoping that him stepping down as CEO would bring an end to Twitters wild rollercoaster ride. While Musk has indicated that hes mainly interested in the Twitter users that are willing to pay him for the service there are another group of people he has to satisfy Tesla shareholders. The companys share price has been tumbling since Musk bought Twitter dropping almost 100 in value since November 1st down to around 137 when markets closed on Tuesday. Musk has several times blamed the drop on interest rates making saving more appealing than investing but some Tesla shareholders have raised concerns about the companys engineers going to work at Twitter and how Musks antics at Twitter reflect on his other companies. The only problem is the optics of having the CEO on Twitter every day discussing the problems of Hunter Biden said Ross Gerber a head of a firm invested in Tesla according to Business Insider. Musk has also sold billions in Tesla stock since he promised to stop doing that this spring and again in the summer. It seems likely that some of the money from the Tesla selloff went to help prop up Twitter. Unfortunately for Tesla shareholders a group that involves Musk whose shares once made him the worlds richest man until the stock price slip cost him that title it doesnt seem like Musk intends on stepping away from Twitter any time soon. Sure whoever he gets as CEO may be tasked with trying to corral advertisers and policymakers both of which have been suspiciously eyeing Twitters new management. But when it comes to the Twitter that people are actually using it sounds like Elon will still be Chief Twit.
"Tesla delivered a record 1.3 million vehicles in 2022, but it still disappointed Wall Street","Tesla delivered a record number of cars last year, as sales continued to grow by percentages any other major automaker would dream about.

But Tesla still managed to disappoint Wall Street throughout 2022 and the last quarter was no different. The electric automaker delivered 1. 3 million vehicles in 2022 up 40 from 2021. It produced nearly 1. 4 million vehicles up 47 from the prior year. Yet the fourth quarter underwhelmed Tesla delivered only 405278 vehicles well below the median estimate of 431000 according to analysts polled by Refinitiv as recession fears and higher interest rates led to a slowdown in demand. Although 40 growth is nothing to sneeze at Teslas pace of growth is slowing. Deliveries nearly doubled in 2021 and more than quadrupled in 2020. Teslas TSLA stock plunged 65 in 2022 as demand weakened. Competition in electric vehicles from established automakers surged last year. The company missed its growth targets throughout the year and it scaled back production in China. Evidence of car buyers sinking interest in Teslas became apparent last month after the company announced a rare sale in a bid to clear out inventory. Tesla offered two rebates for buyers taking delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year initially offering a 3750 discount then doubling the rebate to 7500 with two weeks left in 2022. Investors were rattled by the rebates sending the stock plunging 37 in December alone. Tesla thanked customers and employees for helping the company achieve a great 2022 in light of significant Covid and supply chain related challenges throughout the year according to a statement released on Monday. The company also said it was proud of its growth and progress. We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds which again led to a further increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter the statement read. Tesla said it delivered 1. 25 million of its lessexpensive Model 3 and Model Y electric cars and nearly 67000 of its higherend Model X and Model X lines.
Tesla Delivered a Record 1.31 Million Cars in 2022 Despite Elon,"Tesla delivered 1.31 million electric vehicles in 2022, a 40% increase year-over-year and a record for the company, despite a hot mess CEO who spent the year tweeting and throwing his brands—and $200 billion in net worth—in the toilet.Read more...",2023-01-03T13:27:00Z,https://gizmodo.com/tesla-elon-musk-electric-car-deliveries-131-million-1849943789,Tesla delivered 1. 31 million electric vehicles in 2022 a 40 increase yearoveryear and a record for the company despite a hot mess CEO who spent the year tweeting and throwing his brandsand 200 billion in net worthin the toilet. The deliveries marked a new high for Tesla but they werent enough to make Wall Street happy. Analysts expected Tesla to ship 431000 cars in the fourth quarter but the company only managed to deliver 405000. Overall Tesla delivered 1. 2 million of its less expensive Model 3 and Y cars in 2022 and 66700 Model S and Model X cars which are higherend. On the production side Tesla whipped up 439000 vehicles in the fourth quarter which was notable given that the company rarely produces more cars than it delivers according to Reuters. Production increased by 47 yearoveryear to 1. 37 million cars. Since Tesla doesnt release specific sales data analysts use delivery numbers as one metric to measure the companys performance each quarter. We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds which again led to a further increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter the company said in a short statement alongside its production and delivery update. In addition Tesla thanked its customers employees and suppliers among others for helping it achieve a great 2022 in light of significant COVID and supply chain related challenges throughout the year. Teslas disappointing delivery numbers are the newest problem in the automakers pile of woes many of which were created by CEO Elon Musk who also owns Twitter and SpaceX. The companys stock started sliding rapidly downhill beginning in April when Musk decided he wanted to buy Twitter. He would spend the summer attempting to back out of that deal. Upon realizing he couldnt Musk begrudgingly completed his purchase much to the horror of investors who wanted the billionaire to focus on Tesla. Tesla stock fell 65 in 2022 and the company has been forced to deal with the fallout of Musks actions at Twitter which include laying off thousands of workers forcing people to sign a pledge to stay at an extremely hardcore Twitter firing the janitors and refusing to pay rent for the companys office space. And thats only a snapshot. There are growing indications that the Musk train wreck has soured Teslas devoted customers and investors on the billionaire. CNET reported that customers are canceling their preorders and terminating their leases. Some of the angry buyers posted that Musk is tanking the Tesla brand and that theyre embarrassed to drive their Teslas. Others say that their next electric car wont be a Tesla. Meanwhile Musk fans have become more critical of the man they once worshipped. In December major Tesla shareholder Leo KoGuan criticized the billionaire for abandoning the electric car company. Elon abandoned Tesla and Tesla has no working CEO KoGuan tweeted. Tesla needs and deserves to have working full time CEO.

Acceptance at the newfangled technology was slow at first but over the past ten years as battery capacities have grown and range anxieties have shrunk electric vehicles have become a daily sight in most parts of the country. Doesnt hurt that virtually every notable automaker on the planet has jumped on the electric bandwagon with sizable investments in battery and production technologies as well as pledges to electrify their lineups within a decade or so. Not even recent years production slowdowns and supply chain disruptions brought on by the COVID pandemic managed to stall the industrys momentum. The International Energy Agency in January reported that EVs had managed to triple their market share between 2019 and 2021 with 6. 6 million units being sold globally last year. Thats not to discount the crippling impacts of the chip shortage which saw fleets of nearlyfinished electrified vehicles parked and idled as they awaited necessary components. Or in Teslas case simply sold without the needed part oh calm down its just the steering column theres nothing critical in there anyway thats what autopilot is for right 2022 has eliminated any lingering doubts about whether EVs are here to stay hint they are. So far in 2022 global EV sales are up 70 percent or around 2 million units from 2021s figures according to Morgan Stanley. It is expecting a further 22 percent increase around another 1. 8 million units in 2023. Chinas BYD set monthly EV sales records throughout the year. Domestically an Experian study released in October noted more than 600000 new EV registrations through the first ten months of 2022 a 60 percent yearoveryear jump. EVs may not be quite as ruggedized as their hybrid cousins but who cares about that when youve got Ken Lets See If I Can Barrel Roll This Car Block blowing the doors off of the Vegas Strip in an 800V Audi S1 Hoonitron Or have VW tickling the American publics deep seated nostalgia with a reimagined Hippy Wagon for the 21st century Even Sony is getting into the EV game. EVs are no longer niche theyve become an indelible part of the culture. In terms of market share Tesla and BYD both retained their dominant positions within their relative markets and briefly jockeyed for the world number one spot before BYD pulled away. The Chinese automakers EV sales now account for nearly 20 percent of the global total. For its part Tesla passed notable milestones in its 10000th Model Y produced at the Texas Gigafactory and the millionth vehicle to roll out of production at Gigafactory Shanghai. 2022 also saw big moves and bigger investments from the rest of the automotive industry from Ford and General Motors especially. Ford began delivering its highlyanticipated F150 Lightning EV pickup in May turned them into roving conference rooms with help from Cisco began beta testing their bidirectional charging capabilities with Californias public utility as did GM developed a new battery chemistry announced plans to bring seven more EV models to the European market by 2024 and imagined a world without dealer showrooms for EV sales. General Motors had a banner year of its own. The company began production on its new marquee Lyriq EV unveiled its Yukon Denali Silverado Blazer and Celestiq EVs teased its upcoming Corvette hybrid and secured a sizable federal loan to expand its battery manufacturing base. Not to be left out Hyundai announced in 2022 a 5 billion investment in its USbased production capacity including a new EV factory in Georgia. The Korean automaker which has quietly risen to prominence in the US market in recent years announced its next EV flagship the Ioniq 6 in July the latest in Hyundais effort to release 17 electric vehicle models by the end of the decade. Kia Hyundais sister brand showed off the companys brawnier EV6 GT at Monterey Car Week. VWs 2022 was fruitful as well and it appears that the automaker has fully embraced its electrified future following the dieselgate scandal how could it not. VW opened a new ID. 4 production plant in Tennessee announced plans to invest an additional 7. 1 billion into its North American production capacity over the next five years and dipped its toes into the EV battery business as well. Pfft all Volvo did this year was debut the safest car ever. And it wasnt just the established brands Lucid Motors is riding high this holiday season buoyed by the November unveiling of its new top of the line Air Sapphire along with two ahem relatively less expensive Air model variants which will start at 87000 with 410 miles of range and go up from there. The company also revealed plans this year to sell 100000 units to the Saudi government which has heavily invested in the company. 2022 also saw a drastic expansion of the nations various fast charging networks. In June the Biden White House proposed a set of standards for the national EV charging network. The following month GM announced that it will partner with EVGo to create a 500station coasttocoast fastcharge network and in December opened its first two Community Charging Initiative sites in Wisconsin and Detroit. Hertz fresh off two significant purchase contracts with Polestar and GM revealed it is working with BP to host the latters BP Pulse chargers at select Hertz car rental locations not unlike what VW and BP have planned for Europe. Similarly IKEA will team up with Electrify America to bring EAs fast charging network to the Swedish homeware makers parking lots. Perhaps most exciting the White House in July confirmed rumors that Tesla would be opening its expansive North American SuperCharger network to nonTesla EVs by the end of the year thats an additional 1700plus charging points for drivers to fill up at. But 2022 wasnt all smooth asphalt and sunshine. Rivian fell on hard times this year struggling with production issues layoffs price hikes lawsuits in response to said price hikes followed by reversals of said price hiles delays to the R1S delivery schedule and trim level cullings. Rivian performed so badly in 2022 that it dragged Fords stock value down alongside it but it was still a better year than Lordstown had. And hey at least they didnt use the tip of their tongue to test for live wires like BMW did in July when it tried to paywall access to seat heaters that vehicle owners had already paid for. Even Mercedes had the good sense to charge 1200 a year only for funtime performance extras like added torque and a shortened 060 rather than essential capabilities like retaining rearend sensation on cold winter mornings. We also saw significant pricing fluctuations in EVs this year. Tesla raised prices across the board for its entire lineup as did Polestar with its single motor variant while VW dropped the price of its 2023 ID. 4 by around 4000 thanks to its use of a slightly smaller battery pack. For as eventful as 2022 turned out to be 2023 and beyond is sure to be even bigger for the EV industry. Were expecting debuts of the VW ID. 3 the Lucid Gravity Polestar 3 Jeep one of four and Honda Prologue SUVs. The Kia EV9 is slated for release in the second half of the year while the Buick Wildcat wont be realized until 2024. With any luck these EVs will serve merely as stopgaps until Volkswagen can perfect its Gen. Travel concept and begin shuttling us around in automated transport pods. Like WallE but just as fat.
Tesla shares are down 70% for the year as Morgan Stanley cuts price target,"Tesla's stock is finishing out its tumultuous year with yet more turbulence: It's up almost 6% Thursday, but still down more than 10% since last week. And a new cut to its price target from Morgan Stanley isn't helping.",2022-12-29T18:46:21Z,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/29/business/tesla-stock/index.html,Teslas stock is finishing out its tumultuous year with yet more turbulence Its up almost 6 Thursday but still down more than 10 since last week. And a new cut to its price target from Morgan Stanley isnt helping. Yeartodate the stock is down about 70. Morgan Stanley analysts on Thursday said that the companys sliding stock price represents a buying opportunity but they cut its price target from 330 per share to 250. Tesla shares are trading at 122 with the stock up about 8 Thursday. Morgan Stanley still believes the company is somewhat undervalued as a result of the big recent selloffs citing its head start over the electric car competition and potential tax advantages as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act passed earlier this year. The losses however have further put a dent in the fortunes of one of the worlds richest people. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index CEO Elon Musk is now worth 132 billion less than half what he was worth at the beginning of the year. He lost the worlds richest person title two weeks ago to Bernard Arnault the chairman of French luxury goods giant LVMH LVMHF. Why Tesla is tanking A popular misconception has emerged about Elon Musk and Tesla The megabillionaires love affair with Twitter is the main reason Tesla shares have lost so much value this year. Even as Musk signals he may give up his CEO title at Twitter investors became concerned that the outlook for Teslas sales and profit is taking a turn for the worse. A sign of the weakening demand Tesla has announced a rare sale. The company offered two rebates for buyers who take delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year initially offering a 3750 discount earlier this month. Tesla then doubled that rebate to 7500 last Thursday. Tesla clearly is starting to see demand cracks in China and in the US at a time that EV competition is increasing across the board said Dan Ives tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and a Tesla bull who cut his price target for the stock last Friday from 250 to 175. The price cuts that Tesla enacted was the straw that broke the camels back on the stock. Another reason Teslas stock is sinking The US economy could tip into recession next year hurting car sales. Musk said on a Twitter Spaces call two weeks ago that he foresees the economy will be in a serious recession in 2023. I think there is going to be some macro drama thats higher than people currently think he said according to Reuters adding that homes and cars will get disproportionately impacted by economic conditions. Teslas questionable valuation Part of the problem with Teslas stock price is that critics question whether it was ever worth the trilliondollar valuation it had at the start of the year. At its peak Tesla was worth more than the 12 largest automakers on the planet combined despite having a fraction of the sales of any of them. Today it is worth 399 billion. It got ahead of itself in the nearterm said Gene Munster of Loup Ventures another Tesla fan. I still believe this can be a much bigger company. I think it will see those kinds of numbers again. But it could take a long long time to get there. Teslas growth prospects a target of 50 sales growth annually helped drive that valuation. It conceded in October that it will miss that sales target for this year. The stocks climb to dizzying heights rising 743 in 2020 alone was driven by Musks reputation as a genius who would disrupt the massive global auto industry. Tesla was viewed as a disruptive technology company not as an automaker and a large part of that premium is related to Musk said Ives. Overpromising and underdelivering Critics of Tesla said much of its skyhigh valuation was based on promises that Musk made about future products many of which came years after they were originally promised. A prime example is the Cybertruck the Tesla pickup truck first unveiled three years ago with promises that production would start in 2021. Now production is slated to start next year with a rampup in production in 2024 putting it years behind other electric pickup offerings from Ford and upstart EV maker Rivian both of which have electric pickups available for purchase today. It could also trail planned electric pickup offerings from General Motors. Elon Musk has a pathological problem with the truth said Gordon Johnson one of the largest critics of Tesla among analysts. When people say hes a genius and innovator its based on all his promises he never lives up to. Johnson said Tesla shares will have a much steeper fall ahead once it starts being priced like other automakers rather than on its promises. He said that for Tesla to hit its growth targets it needs to be building new plants almost every year but that new factories in Germany and Texas that opened in spring are still not operating at full capacity. And he said that its plant in China has had to scale back production due to weak sales in the market in the face of the Covid restrictions. Demand in the US has collapsed he said. Two months ago your wait time was two or three months. Now you can get one immediately. Theyre going to build more cars than they sell for a third straight quarter. Its the definition of excess capacity. Tesla is still by far the largest EV maker worldwide although that title is being challenged in some key markets by Volkswagen in Europe and by BYD in China. And more competition is coming from established automakers such as Ford and GM. The Twitter factor Thats not to say Twitter has played no role in Teslas stock price demise this year Tesla shares have lost over 65 of their value since Musks interest in Twitter was first disclosed in April with a nearly 50 decline since he closed on the deal in late October. Investors have been disappointed that Musk appears to be paying for so much of his 44 billion purchase of Twitter by selling Tesla stock. Musk Teslas largest shareholder has sold 23 billion worth of Tesla shares since his interest in Twitter became public in April. On a Twitter Spaces call last week call Musk promised he was done selling shares of Tesla TSLA stock until at least 2024 if not beyond. But he hasnt lived up to a previous promise in April that he was done selling Tesla TSLA shares selling 14. 4 billion of that stock since that time. Its been a Pinocchio situation for Musk saying he is done selling stock. Investors want to see him walk the walk and not just talk the talk said Ives.
Tesla's Model Y could fall foul of new EV tax credit eligibility rules,"Certain variants of Tesla's Model Y may not qualify for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit based on the IRS's latest guidelines, a situation that Elon Musk has called ""messed up.""

It looks as though the fiveseat Long Range version of the hatchback is too expensive as a car and not considered an SUV so it falls outside the current guidelines. That could change though as the rules wont be finalized until March 2023. The IRS has divided vehicles into two categories vans SUVs and pickup trucks under 80000 and other vehicles under 55000. For the first category the vehicle must have 4wheel drive or be rated at more than 6000 pounds of gross weight. It also has to meet four of five other characteristics most notably front and rear axle clearances of 18 centimeters or higher and a running clearance of at least 20 centimeters no Model Y meets these specs. According to the IRS only the 7seat variants of the Model Y qualify as SUVs in the category up to 80000 while the 5seat vehicles Long Range AWD and Performance are in the 55000 section. The 7seaters comfortably fall under the 85000 limit but all the 5seaters exceed the 55000 price so they dont qualify. Tesla doesnt have a specific AWD variant of the Model Y in the US both the Long Range and Performance models are AWD so its not clear which model the IRS is referring to. The 5 and 7seat versions cost the same starting at 65990 for the Long Range version before destination and order charges. Critics are pointing out that far more polluting hybrid vehicles qualify for the tax credits including two Jeeps the Audi Q5 e Quattro BMW X5 xDrive45e and Fords Escape PHEV. However if someone buys a Jeep Wrangler with 56 MPGe 23 MPG after the battery is depleted instead of a Tesla Model Y with 122 MPGe then the government clearly isnt doing the most it can to reduce carbon emissions. The IRS has invited consumers to comment on the matter and Musk encouraged people to do so in a tweet.
Tesla cuts prices in China for the second time in three months as demand slows,"Tesla has slashed car prices in China for the second time in less than three months, in an effort to boost sales amidst slowing demand in the world's largest car market.",2023-01-06T11:12:16Z,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/06/economy/tesla-china-price-cut-slowdown-intl-hnk/index.html,Tesla has slashed car prices in China for the second time in less than three months The electric vehicle maker cut prices for all versions The starting price for Model 3 has been reduced by 13. 5 to 229900 yuan 33515 while the starting price for Model Y has been slashed by 10 to 259900 yuan 37889 according to CNN calculations. This is the second price cut since October 24 when Tesla TSLA reduced the prices of Model 3 and Model Y by as much as 9. 4. Previously Tesla TSLA had increased prices by several times in the past two years. Teslas price cuts are backed by innumerable engineering innovations said Grace Tao Teslas vice president for external relations in China on her Weibo account on Friday. We are responding to the countrys call with practical actions to promote economic development and release the potential of domestic demand. The discount comes at a time when the American electric vehicles maker is struggling to maintain its sales in China its biggest international market. In December Teslas Shanghai factory delivered 55796 vehicles down 44 from November according to figures released by the China Passenger Car Association on Thursday. Overall sales in December reported by automakers fell 4 from the same month a year ago as the worlds second largest economy slows to the weakest pace in decades. Teslas price cuts come days after Beijing The Chinese government had planned to phase out its costly EV subsidy program by the end of 2020 but extended it during the pandemic to avert a sharp economic slowdown. The company has been struggling outside China as well. Last year Tesla produced more cars than it delivered which means its inventory has increased. On Tuesday Teslas stock on Wall Street had its worst day in two years dragged down by weakerthanexpected sales data globally. The companys shares ended 2022 down 65 greatly cutting into CEO Elon Musks net worth. The major worry now for Tesla is that the demand story especially out of China is showing heavy cracks in the armor said analysts from Wedbush Securities earlier this week. EV competition is also increasing domestically in China with Nio BYD Xpeng and other brands fighting for a smaller pie they said. A potential pricing war could take place to gain market share they added. CNNs Chris Isidore and David Goldman contributed to the article.
Tesla plunges 250 feet off a California cliff and the 4 occupants survive,Two adults and two children somehow escaped serious injuries after their Tesla plunged off a cliff along California's Pacific Coast Highway and crashed on a rocky beach some 250 feet below.,2023-01-03T21:16:34Z,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/03/us/tesla-crash-cliff-california-cec/index.html,Editors Note The man was arrested after allegedly driving off a cliff intentionally on the Pacific Coast Highway. Find the latest story here. Two adults and two children somehow escaped serious injuries after their Tesla plunged off a cliff along Californias Pacific Coast Highway and crashed on a rocky beach some 250 feet below. The incident occurred Monday morning at an area called Devils Slide some 20 miles south of San Francisco. We were very shocked to discover that people in the car had survived the crash said Brian Pottenger battalion chief with Cal Fires Coastside Fire Protection District. Accidents on that cliff are not rare. We do respond to a lot of vehicles on that cliff he told CNN. Whats rare is that we do not get a lot of survivors surviving this type of accident is very rare. Pottenger said the car contained an adult male an adult female a 9yearold boy and a 4yearold girl. The children were both secured in car seats which remained intact and in place he said. Officials said the fourdoor white Tesla sedan was traveling southbound on Highway 1 just south of the Tom Lantos Tunnel between Pacifica and Montara when it veered off the roadway. They did not cite a reason for the crash. A spokesperson for the California Highway Patrol told CNN they do not believe any of the Teslas selfdriving features were active at the time. The damage to the vehicle would indicate that it hit and then flipped several times Pottenger said. The car came to rest on its wheels he added. Firefighters rappelled down the cliff to the car while other first responders watched through binoculars. As we were doing that we were able to notice movement in the front seat through the windshield Pottenger said. So we knew that we had at least one person that was alive. The cars occupants were trapped inside the mangled vehicle officials said. All four were conscious when the fire department reached them Pottenger told CNN. Crews freed the two children and used a rope to lift them up the cliff in baskets. Later a California Highway Patrol helicopter hoisted the two adults to safety. The California Highway Patrol posted dramatic video of the helicopter lowering a rescuer on a cable to the crash site while surf crashed against the rocks below. The San Mateo Sheriffs Office said Monday that the two adults suffered nonlife threatening injuries and the two children were unharmed. The cars occupants were transported to Stanford Medical Center for treatment Pottenger said. An update on their conditions was not available Tuesday. Officials have not released the identities of the four survivors or said whether all four were from the same family. The CHP is investigating and will determine the cause of the crash Pottenger said. This was a traumatic accident and they survived he said. And it was a good outcome to a very bad situation. CNNs Taylor Romine contributed to this story.
Top Tesla investor has buyer's remorse and says Elon Musk is 'killing' the EV company with stock sales,"""I am 100% in Tesla bc I believe in Elon Musk and Tesla. But he is killing SH and Tesla. If I knew I wouldn't invest in Tesla,"" Leo KoGuan tweeted.",2023-01-09T17:48:33Z,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-investor-leo-koguan-elon-musk-share-sales-twitter-2023-1,Teslas third largest shareholder appeared to show some buyers remorse as he criticized Elon Musks share sales. I am 100 in Tesla bc I believe in Elon Musk and Tesla. But he is killing SH and Tesla. If I knew I wouldnt invest in Tesla Leo KoGuan tweeted. But in a series of weekend tweets he also said he bought more Tesla stock last week. Teslas thirdlargest individual shareholder thinks Elon Musk is damaging shareholders and the company through massive sales of personal stock. In a series of tweets over the weekend Leo KoGuan seemed to express some buyers remorse but still reaffirmed his commitment to the stock. I am 100 in Tesla bc I believe in Elon Musk and Tesla. But he is killing SH and Tesla. If I knew I wouldnt invest in Tesla. Elon invested 200mm but took out 40B Larry invested 1B I invested over 3B I have no choice but to act and speak out. I cry out to U for help KoGuan said on Saturday. Musk has cashed in nearly 40 billion of Tesla stock since November 2021. Meanwhile Tesla earned less than 9 billion of net income in the nine months to September 30. Tesla stock lost a staggering 65 in 2022. KoGuans comments come as Musk draws scrutiny for his focus on his latest role as chief executive at Twitter the social media company he acquired in October. In his tweetstorm over the weekend he dismissed some of his critics as cult followers and directed his criticism largely at Musk whom he seems to refer to as the one. I contacted the board and the one for about 1 year what I got was nothing or at best only empty promises. Actually from these interactions I found out Tesla is one man show company but it is no longer a family business. It is a public company with more than 100000 employees added KoGuan founder and chairman of IT provider SHI International. He currently sits on roughly 23 million shares as of September 2022 and amassed the majority of the fortune during the pandemic months of 2020. Despite his criticism of Musk KoGuan tweeted Friday that he bought 450000 additional Tesla shares last week and plans to buy a million more. He remains a fervent supporter of the company and last month said he plans to invest more billion bc Tesla will be the biggest company with or without Elon. Also last month KoGuan said that it may be time for a new CEO saying Musk has abandoned Tesla. And last week he suggested Musk was intentionally sending the electriccar makers stock lower.
The truth about 'medbeds' - a miracle cure that doesn't exist,Why has a fictional miracle cure taken off online - and who's making money out of it?,2022-12-27T00:45:37Z,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-64070190,The truth about medbeds a miracle cure that doesnt exist Published Strange corners of the internet are awash with chatter about miracle devices that can cure nearly any ailment you can think of using the power of mystical energy. Some companies charge thousands for these medbeds but their claims are far from proven. A converted motel in a small town on the Mississippi River seems an unlikely home for a worldchanging technology what a flyer in the mostly deserted lobby calls a new wave of scientific healing. But since last summer this building in East Dubuque Illinois three hours west of Chicago has been outfitted with medical devices that supposedly imbue patients with life force energy. Its one of a number of locations run by Tesla BioHealing no relation to the car company dotted around the US. I tried out a medbed on a recent gloomy weekday afternoon. After being greeted at the front desk a doctor tested my energy levels by having me place my fingers inside a metal box. Then I was ushered into one of the rooms mostly unchanged from its motel days and I waited for pure biophoton lifeforce energy to stream into my body. The idea of medbeds short either for medical beds or meditation beds has become increasingly popular on fringe medical channels on mainstream social networks and chat apps. But people have very different ideas about what they actually are. Some insist that the technology is secret unlikely to be encountered by mere mortals hidden from the public by billionaires and the deep state. The more conspiratorial theorising includes speculation about alien technology and bizarre claims like the idea that John F Kennedy is still alive strapped to a medbed. A separate more earthly avenue of thought holds that medbeds are very real and publicly available just not part of the medical mainstream. Its this strand that Tesla BioHealing and a range of other companies are staking their rather expensive claims on. Tesla BioHealing offers home generators for prices up to 19999 16500 although an hour in one of their medbed motel rooms will only set you back 160 130. But even in the consumerfocused medbed world where there is no talk of aliens or JFK theres disagreement about what a medbed actually is. And theres a very good reason for that says Sara Aniano a disinformation analyst at the Anti Defamation Leagues Centre on Extremism. Its really hard to define something that doesnt exist she says. Ms Aniano has been researching the spread of medbed chat online and as part of her inquiries signed up for trial with a different medbed company 90. 10. The trial is nothing she says. It tells you to lay on your bed and think really hard about the medbed. In their defence they do list on their website in the very fine print down at the bottom that the medbed is not meant to treat or diagnose illnesses she says. Its a common disclaimer that we saw used in some form by just about every company offering a medbedrelated product. Even though companies put out long lists of ailments that can supposedly be helped by their technologies and provide testimonials from satisfied customers they say that their products are not meant to replace treatments by a qualified doctor. Tesla BioHealing is no exception. The top of the companys website clearly states We cannot diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease or condition. And yet their promotional material states Many people note improvements in their wellbeing even after only an hour of resting on a Tesla MedBed. They also make a number of specific unsupported claims about particular diseases. The staff at the Tesla BioHealing motel in East Dubuque told me about legions of customers with all manner of ailments all of whom they said had been helped by medbeds. But in my room I felt nothing more than curiosity and a slight sense of unease as I gazed out the window at a mostly empty car park. The Tesla Medbed cannisters were sealed in wooden boxes and a bedside table. Cutting short my hour I returned to the doctors office where she repeated the test with my fingers in the metal box. Sure enough my energy as measured by the doctors laptop was already rising. But neither the doctor nor anyone else at Tesla BioHealing could tell me what was inside the medbed cannisters themselves. Some enterprising customers have taken it upon themselves to try to find out. We came across a TikTok video where an upset punter appears to have opened up a cannister only to find a concretelike substance. For anyone whos thinking about buying one of those Tesla biohealers dont waste your money she says. The company wouldnt be drawn on what active ingredients if any are inside the cannisters. But they told us in an email There is much more going on with our technology than meets the eye. And while they said the Tesla cannisters were not intended to replace a doctors care they also made further claims of cures and said Health benefits are priceless. Both Tesla BioHealing and 90. 10 pointed us to thousands of positive customer testimonials. And despite the prominent claim on the company website that 90. 10 offers Quantumfrequency medicine with scientific proof 90. 10 chief executive Oliver Schalke told us It is not a medical product and was never intended to be. How then are the medbed companies allowed to offer their products hint at miraculous effects but escape any regulatory oversight Dr Steven Barrett a retired psychiatrist who has been investigating questionable claims for decades says the health care regulator in the United States the Food and Drug Administration FDA is partly to blame. FDA registration is required by any manufacturer who wants to market products but it just means that youve notified the FDA that you exist he says. Tesla BioHealing and other companies advertise that they are FDA registered but that is next to meaningless. FDA registration says nothing about whether a device is useful says Dr Barrett. When it comes to making vague claims about general wellbeing or unprovable statements about increased energy authorities do almost nothing about it he says. He speaks with a note of weariness perhaps because of a lack of biophotons but more likely the result of spending decades tracking dubious health claims. Do I think that exposure to whatever it is that theyre giving you in the bed is going to make you more energetic I seriously doubt that he says. Indeed as I began a long evening drive home from East Dubuque under cloudy skies I felt distinctly lacking in life force energy. With reporting by Elizabeth Hotson and Shayan Sardarizadeh
U.S. asks Tesla about Musk tweet on driver monitoring function - Reuters,"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Monday it is in contact with Tesla <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O"" target=""_blank"">(TSLA.O)</a> about a tweet Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk wrote about a driver monitoring fu…",2023-01-09T15:56:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-asks-tesla-about-musk-tweet-driver-monitoring-function-2023-01-09/,U. S. asks Tesla about Musk tweet on driver monitoring function WASHINGTON Jan 9 Reuters The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA Monday said it was in contact with Tesla TSLA. O about a tweet Chief Executive Elon Musk wrote about a driver monitoring function. A Dec. 31 tweet suggested drivers with more than 10000 miles using Teslas Full SelfDriving FSD software system should be able to disable the steering wheel nag an alert that instructs drivers to hold the wheel to confirm they are paying attention. Musk responded Agreed update coming in Jan. NHTSA Monday said it is in contact with Tesla to gather additional information. The Associated Press reported NHTSAs statement earlier. Tesla did not immediately comment. The auto safety agency confirmed the questions about Musks tweet are in connection with its ongoing defect probe into 830000 Tesla vehicles with driver assistance system Autopilot and involving crashes with parked emergency vehicles. NHTSA is reviewing whether Tesla vehicles adequately ensure drivers are paying attention and previously said evidence suggested drivers in most crashes under review had complied with Teslas alert strategy that seeks to compel driver attention raising questions about its effectiveness. Tesla sells the 15000 FSD software as an addon which enables its vehicles to change lanes and park autonomously. That complements its standard Autopilot feature which enables cars to steer accelerate and brake within their lanes without driver intervention. Both systems use the steering wheel monitoring function. Last month NHTSA said it had opened two new special investigations into crashes involving Tesla vehicles where advanced driver assistance systems are suspected to have been in use. Since 2016 NHTSA has opened more than three dozen Tesla special crash investigations where advanced driver assistance systems such as Autopilot were suspected of being used with 19 crash deaths reported. In December 2021 NHTSA opened a probe into Teslas decision to allow games to be played by passengers on the front center touchscreen covering 580000 vehicles over the vehicles Passenger Play over driver distraction concerns. Soon after the investigation was opened Tesla told NHTSA it would stop allowing video games to be played on vehicle screens while its cars are moving the agency said.

Although the car was left mangled all four people in itthe driver his wife and their two young childrensurvived. California authorities received a report Monday about the crash which occurred on Highway 1 in an area called Devils Slide known as being hard to drive through. Upon arriving at the scene they found that Dharmesh Patel his wife their 9yearold son and their 4yearold daughter were not only alive but conscious. After reviewing the evidence collected the California State Highway Patrol said on Tuesday that there was probable cause to believe this incident was an intentional act according to CNN. Brian Pottenger a battalion chief with the Coastside Fire Protection District told news outlets that the damage to the Tesla indicated that it hit the ground and then flipped several times before landing upright on its wheels. In an interview with the New York Times Pottenger underscored how noteworthy it was that the story ended the way it did. It is very unusual for anyone to survive an accident of this magnitude in this area Pottenger told the outlet. Firefighters rappelled down the cliff to the car to rescue the two children while California Highway Patrol used a helicopter to extricate the two adults. The rescue of the adults can be seen in a dramatic and jawdropping video highway patrol posted on Facebook. Due to conflicting media reports the extent of the familys injuries is currently not clear. Given Teslas dangerous track record of accidents involving its selfdriving modes some questioned whether the car itself was to blame for the horrifying incident. However the California Highway Patrol said the vehicle didnt appear to be the culprit. There has been no determination as to what driving mode the Tesla was in however that does not appear to be a contributing factor in this incident the highway patrol said as reported by CNN.
Elon Musk: Only blue tick users to vote in Twitter polls on policy,The billionaire says he will change the policy on Twitter votes after users say he should step down.,2022-12-20T12:10:16Z,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64034892,Elon Musk Only blue tick users to vote in Twitter polls on policy Published Elon Musk has said Twitter will only allow accounts with a blue tick to vote on changes to policy after a majority of users voted for him to quit. Mr Musk launched a Twitter poll asking if he should step down as chief executive 57. 5 of users voted yes. Since then he has not commented directly on the result of the poll. But he has said that Twitter will alter its rules so that only people who pay for a subscription can vote on company policy. One user claimed that socalled bots appeared to have voted heavily in the poll about Mr Musks role at the firm. Mr Musk said he found the claim interesting. The billionaire had said when he ran the poll that he would abide by the result. If he does quit as chief executive he will remain as Twitters owner. Bruce Daisley former vice president of Twitter compared any potential change to that of a football manager. The chairman still remains and Elon Musk is going to be that everpresent voice in the back of the room he told the BBCs Today programme. However Mr Musks intentions remain unclear. Although US broadcaster CNBC tweeted on Tuesday that Mr Musk is actively searching for a new chief executive for Twitter Mr Musk responded with two laughing emojis. In response to a tweet saying Twitter Blue subscribers should be the only ones that can vote in policy related polls. We actually have skin in the game Mr Musk said Good point Twitter will make that change. Twitters paidfor verification feature was rolled out for a second time last week after its launch was paused. The service costs 8 per month or 11 for people using the Twitter app on Apple devices and gives subscribers a blue tick. Previously a blue tick was used as verification tool for highprofile accounts as a badge of authenticity and was free. On Monday Mr Musk held a poll on his future as chief executive. More than 17. 5 million users voted and the majority backed him stepping down. Should I step down as head of Twitter I will abide by the results of this poll. Elon Musk elonmusk December 18 2022 While the poll was running he replied to one user suggesting there was no replacement chief executive lined up saying No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor. The technology tycoon who also runs electric car maker Tesla and space rocket firm Space X has faced much criticism since taking over the site. He has obeyed the results of his Twitter polls in the past and quoted the phrase vox populi vox dei a Latin phrase which roughly means the voice of the people is the voice of God. Mr Musk bought Twitter for 44bn 36bn in October after attempting to back out of the deal. Since taking control he has been criticised for his approach to content moderation with some civil liberties groups accusing him of taking steps that will increase hate speech and misinformation. On Friday he was condemned by the United Nations and European Union over Twitters decision to suspend some journalists who cover the social media firm. He has also fired about half of Twitters staff. Mr Daisley said through Mr Musks activity you could get a hint over what he was thinking through his replies to users. He does seem to be quibbling with the vote he added. Mr Musk has also been accused of neglecting his electric car company Tesla which is where most of his wealth is. Tesla shares have lost more than 60 in value this year with some saying his obsession with Twitter is destroying the brand. Last week Leo KoGuan the third largest individual shareholder in Tesla called for Mr Musk to step down as the boss of the electric car maker. Elon abandoned Tesla and Tesla has no working CEO. Tesla needs and deserves to have a working full time CEO he tweeted.

Kevin McCarthys bid for House Speaker. The two have been friendly for years Musk has donated to McCarthys campaign five times and attended the California Republicans donors retreat last year as McCarthys personal guest. McCarthy has called Musk the Thomas Edison of our time and run political interference on his behalf. Musk tweeted out his support for McCarthy on Thursday morning hours before the House of Representatives was set to reconvene to try to elect a Speaker for a seventh time. Kevin McCarthy should be Speaker Musk said via his social network. Musks support of McCarthy who has already lost six consecutive votes to become Speaker this week aligns with the billionaires pivot to the political right in recent months. Most recently Musk recommended that people vote Republican in the midterms. Although the Tesla CEO isnt a big political donor he has made donations to McCarthys campaigns at least five times according to Federal Election Commission records albeit in small amounts no more than 2700. In August of last year Musk attended McCarthys annual donor retreat in Wyoming as the Republicans personal guest. At the event McCarthy introduced Musk as the Thomas Edison of our time Axios reported. Its not clear whether Musks support McCarthy will do any good. The California Republican is dealing with 20 hardright defectors who refuse to vote for him. Even McCarthys endorsement from former President Donald Trump has failed to sway the hardliners so its hard to believe that Musks seal of approval would be any different. The House is scheduled to reconvene at noon ET. The House Republican also spoke up on behalf of Musk in November telling reporters that the White House should stop picking on Elon Musk after White House officials said they were keeping an eye on Musks reforms at Twitter. That is offensive to me. Governments going to go after someone that wants to have free speech. What do they have to look at Twitter about McCarthy said on Nov. 29. I think the American public have spoken on this. I think our First Amendment stands up and I think they should stop picking on Elon Musk. McCarthys praise and defense of Musk stands in stark contrast to President Joe Bidens administration which Musks feels has snubbed him by ignoring Tesla. Biden has repeatedly praised automakers like Ford and GM for their innovation in electric vehicles since taking office but he hasnt mentioned Tesla.
Tesla suspends production at Shanghai plant - Reuters,"Tesla suspended production at its Shanghai plant on Saturday, according to an internal notice and two people with knowledge of the matter, bringing ahead a previous plan to pause most work at the plant in the last week of December.",2022-12-24T12:52:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-suspends-production-shanghai-plant-internal-notice-2022-12-24/,Tesla suspends production at Shanghai plant SHANGHAI Dec 24 Reuters Tesla suspended production at its Shanghai plant on Saturday according to an internal notice and two people with knowledge of the matter bringing ahead a previous plan to pause most work at the plant in the last week of December. The U. S. automaker cancelled the morning shift and told all workers at its most productive manufacturing hub they could start their break said the people and the notice seen by Reuters. The company did not give a reason. Reuters reported earlier this month that the electric car giant planned to suspend Model Y production at the plant from Dec. 25 to Jan. 1. The suspension comes among a rising wave of infections after China eased its zeroCOVID policy earlier this month an abrupt move welcomed by businesses and the public but heavily disrupting business operations in the short term. One of the people said workers at Tesla and its suppliers have also been falling sick as part of this wave posing challenges to operations in the past week. Tesla is also grappling with elevated inventory levels as its second largest market braces for a downturn. The Shanghai plant has been focused on making models for export in the last week the person added. A media representative at Tesla China did not immediately respond to request for comment. The plants suspension of Model Y assembly at the end of the month would be part of a cut in planned production of about 30 in the month for the model Teslas bestselling model at the Shanghai factory Reuters had reported. The Shanghai factory the most important manufacturing hub for Elon Musks electric vehicle company kept normal operations during the last week of December last year. It has not been an established practice for the plant to shut down for a yearend holiday. Our Standards The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Apple Music support for Tesla cars is something that Tesla owners have long been waiting for as the electric car company has previously only worked with streaming services like Spotify. The experience works as you might expect and the full Apple Music service is available. The navigation experience is superior compared to Spotify such as options for tapping into songs from a playlist to get to the entire album along with better interface interactions. Navigation is also straightforward though its worth noting that it does not appear that iTunes Match content is available for access. Lossless and Dolby Atmos also do not appear to be available at this time in Teslas and it is not clear if that functionality is going to be enabled at a later date.

Musk told listeners on the chat that he needed powder dry to prepare for a potential recession. Elon Musk told Tesla investors he wouldnt sell additional shares of his EV company in the near future and that he only sold recently to prepare for a potential recession. Im not selling any stock for I dont know at minimum 18 to 24 months. So you can count on no stock sales until 2025 or something Musk said in a Twitter Spaces chat on Thursday. I needed to sell some stock to make sure there was powder dry to account for a worstcase scenario he added. This isnt the first time Musk has vowed not to sell more Tesla stock this year. In August after selling more than 8 billion worth of Tesla stock to help finance his purchase of Twitter Musk tweeted no further TSLA sales planned after today. Earlier this month he sold another 3. 6 billion in Tesla shares though. The stock traded at a 52week low as of Thursdays close. Musk weighed in on the broader economy with a gloomy outlook for the coming year from a longterm standpoint theres a natural economic cycle that happens and frankly were overdue for a recession he said. Its shocking that we havent had an economic recession in any meaningful sense of the word since 2009 he added. Some investors have expressed worry that Musk has become disengaged as Teslas CEO as he shifts his focus to leading Twitter further causing Teslas stock to sink. However Musk said that there was not a single important meeting that I missed at Tesla since taking the reigns at Twitter telling listeners in the Spaces chat that he only sold Tesla shares because hes somewhat paranoid having gone through two very intense recessions.

As such the curtain is being pulled on the mystery behind the cash flowing through some of Silicon Valleys biggest companies. This past September California Governor Gavin Newsom officially signed Senate Bill 1162 into law which requires California companies with more than 15 employees to post a positions salary in its job posting. Likewise current employees can request the pay scale of their position from the company. New York City enacted a similar pay transparency law earlier this year with only minor hiccups and New York State has also signed a statewide pay transparency law. Senate Bill 1162 was specifically designed to tackle gender pay gaps according to quotes from Governor Newsom but an unintended side effect of the states transparency law is that it now sheds light on how much some of the worlds largest tech companies pay their workers. Gizmodo took a look at three random job openings each from Meta Apple and Tesla to find out how much these companies are paying for different positions. While job posting websites like Indeed do offer salary estimates these salary ranges are likely more accurate as they are straight from the horses mouth. Californiabased jobs at Meta pay Software Engineer Leadership Product at Meta requires 12 years of programming experience and 8 years of experience with web or mobile technologies 205000 to 281000 per year Data Scientist Machine Learning at Facebook requires at minimum a 197000 to 269000 per year Research Scientist Intern Computer Vision and Machine Learning for Messenger requires that the applicant either has or is in the process of getting a Ph. D. and Meta says that internships last anywhere from 1224 weeks long 7313 to 10250 per month. Californiabased jobs at Apple pay Shipping Receiving and Mail Lead requires 5 years experience in a fastpaced Shipping Receiving and Mail team or similar environment 29. 04 to 43. 59 per hour 60403. 20 to 90667. 20 per yearassuming a 40 hour work week for 52 weeks Display Technologist generally requires a Ph. D. or a Masters degree with more than 5 years of experience in relevant field 113500 and 207000 per year WiFi Quality Engineer is an entrylevel position that requires at least two years of experience with both 802. 11 protocols andor Bluetooth and software quality assurance methodologies and practices and only requires a Bachelors degree 113500 and 171000 per year. Californiabased jobs at Tesla pay Solar Maintenance Lead Roofer requires general hardware and wiring expertise along with customer service skills and a valid drivers license 14. 63 to 52. 62 per hour 30430. 40 to 109449. 60per year assuming a 40 hour work week for 52 weeks Automotive Painter requires at least 5 years experience in refinishing cars and you must be 18 years or older 18. 24 to 82. 08 per hour 37939. 20 to 170726. 40assuming a 40 hour work week for 52 weeks Associate Quality Engineer requires a Bachelors degree in engineering or a related technical field and a willingness to travel 57600 to 309600per year. The salary ranges on some of the positions are comically massive which probably isnt great for the potential employee if theyre being offered a job on the lower end. But it does give both the company and the job seekers wiggle room to negotiate. Each of these corporations had hundreds of job openings in California alone and Gizmodo took at look at a few more from each company. On the surface it appeared that Meta offered less entrylevel positions than Apple and Tesla. Tesla meanwhile seems to be leaning heavier into positions that pay hourly as opposed to annually. And while Tesla has positioned itself as a tech company theres been recent pushback among investors labeling it a carmaker not a tech firm.
A Tesla driver watched in horror as another Tesla burst into flames after hitting a barrier,"Josh Kaplan spoke with the other driver, who said he was using the Autopilot system when his Tesla failed to follow a bend and then struck a barrier.",2022-12-26T12:51:37Z,https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-driver-watched-in-horror-tesla-crashed-burst-into-flames-2022-12,A Tesla driver watched in horror as another Tesla burst into flames after hitting a barrier A Tesla driver watched in horror as another Tesla hit a barrier and burst into flames. Josh Kaplan was driving on the 405 freeway in Los Angeles when he encountered the crash. Josh Kaplan was driving his Tesla Model X on the 405 freeway in Los Angeles last month when he saw a vehicle ahead of him had suddenly stopped. I noticed a car facing left against the barrier despite the road veering to the right he told Insider. He realised that vehicle was also a Tesla and had smoke coming from it. In the time it took me to call 911 it caught fire. Kind of looked like sparklers going off Kaplan said. He got out and spoke to the driver of the crashed Tesla who was not injured in the incident. The driver told Kaplan he had his 2018 Model X in Autopilot but it suddenly veered hard to the left and stopped against the wall. Kaplan bought his Tesla about four months ago with 6000 miles on the clock but said It has been a complete disappointment software notwithstanding the fit and finish are miserable. He said hes also experienced many frightening miscalculations by Autopilot in his Model X. Just last week it completely ignored a traffic cone on the highway and ran over it he told Insider. That was just before the car turned from an inside of a doubleturn lane into the outside lane despite there being other vehicles already occupying that space. Commenting on the latest version of the system Kaplan said The user interface would often display a blank screen when the software crashes or the system doesnt update that some basic functions including navigation voice being turned off instead of the previous setting. This means that if youre driving and the computer crashes which it has done multiple times you are left with a blank screen and no way to know what your car is doing.

Elon Musk Tweet Inspires Fan to File Boat Trademark On Behalf of Tesla — Without Telling Tesla,A Tesla superfan said filed a trademark application for boats because Elon Musk mentioned the Cybertruck might be able to go in the water.,2023-01-05T17:57:00Z,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/tesla-fan-files-trademark-for-tesla-unbeknownst-to-tesla/442310,Elon Musk Tweet Inspires Fan to File Boat Trademark On Behalf of Tesla Without Telling Tesla A Tesla superfan said they filed a trademark application for boats because Elon Musk mentioned the Cybertruck might be able to go in the water. There are fans and then there are fans who want to help you deal with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office USPTO. And thats just what one loyal fan did on behalf of the company according to Bloomberg. Tesla superfan Jerome Eady filed a trademark application on December 28 with the Tesla company listed as the owner of the trademark for not for land vehicles. The trademark would give the company protection from a general IP perspective to sell a Teslabranded product that was covered by this trademark application and then sue anyone who was using its name to sell such a product. The application covers per the trademark filing application page asynchronous motors not for land vehicles including airplane and boat motors. Typically a companys trademark filings are indicators of the companys plans to expand into other products. And as such news outlets started reporting that Tesla had filed the application and was planning to potentially expand into boats and airplanes. But that wasnt exactly what happened. Eady who spoke with Bloomberg via the phone said that he did it proactively on the companys behalf because Elon Musk said in September that Teslas planned Cybertruck product an electric vehicle truck that you can reserve online for 100 could be a shortterm boat. Keegan Caldwell founder and managing member of an intellectual property firm told Entrepreneur that takes about an hour and a half to file an initial trademark application. The entire trademark process takes 12 to 18 months per the USPTO. Typically customers do not engage in proactive IP management on behalf of their favorite companies Caldwell said. Eady said he has no affiliation with Tesla and the filing was made without the companys knowledge Bloomberg wrote. Its a surprise to see something like this happen Caldwell added. It is exceedingly rare. Cybertruck will be waterproof enough to serve briefly as a boat so it can cross rivers lakes even seas that arent too choppy Elon Musk elonmusk September 29 2022 The trademark applications status was last updated on December 31 and is waiting to be assigned to an attorney to review it. Caldwell is also not sure if a trademark can be filed on behalf of Tesla or any company without that specific company signing it or endorsing it in some way. Related From Using Children As Props to Embedding Car Keys In a Hand Tesla Owners Are a Passionate Bunch Regardless of actions taken by Tesla superfans the company does have an interesting approach to IP. Tesla said in 2014 it But Tesla has not taken such a handsoff approach when it comes to enforcing its trademarks. It sued an accessories seller that was using the Tesla name and trademark in March for trademark infringement for example. The attorney listed on Eadys application had a Washington D.

Tax credit confusion could create a rush for electric vehicles in early 2023,"As the new year begins, a number of popular electric vehicles, specifically some Tesla and General Motors models, could be eligible for $7,500 worth of tax credits they weren't eligible for in 2022. But that eligibility may last only last a few months.",2022-12-28T18:09:22Z,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/business/ev-tax-credit/index.html,As the new year begins a number of popular electric vehicles specifically some Tesla and General Motors models could be eligible for 7500 worth of tax credits they werent eligible for in 2022. But that eligibility may last only last a few months. Thats because The US Treasury Department which is implementing the rules recently announced that rules for some of the new restrictions on the tax credits including around where the vehicles battery pack is assembled and where the minerals used in it came from were being postponed until at least March of 2023 when it announces proposed rules around that part of the requirements. According to language in the legislation though just the publication of the proposed guidance around these rules which Treasury said would happen in March will immediately trigger the reductions in tax credits. General Motors While that could create a buying opportunity in the first months of the year the downside is that it just adds to confusion around what is already a baffling set of rules even by tax regulation standards. I was kind of hoping for more clarity not less said Chris Harto a senior Essentially the tax rules are designed to incentivize automakers to make their electric vehicles and all the parts of those vehicles as much as possible in the United States or in countries with which the US has trade agreements. Theyre also designed so tax credits dont go to wealthy Americans buying expensive luxury vehicles. The latest announcement which will temporarily open up more tax credit money is likely Figuring out who and what qualifies The lopsided tax credit at the start of the year is just one of several potential sources of confusion. Under the new EV tax credit rules the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV are eligible for tax credits in the new year. They had previously been ineligible because even though theyre built in North America one of the requirements Still not every buyer and not every electric vehicle will be eligible for credits. For instance besides the requirement that the vehicle must be built in North America there will be restrictions on its price too. If its an SUV van or pickup its sticker price must not be higher than 80000 and if its a car not more than 55000. These price caps will be based on the vehicles full Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price MSRP or sticker price including all factoryinstalled options. If the dealer charges more for the vehicle or it theres a discount or rebate that wont matter. Eligibility for the rebate is based only the actually MSRP. As a result most Tesla models including It shuffles the deck as to whos eligible and then the deck will get shuffled again when this guidance comes out in March said Harto. And it just makes a giant mess for consumers and automakers and dealers. Also no flipping allowed. The person purchasing the vehicle has to be the end user. If youre purchasing the vehicle just to immediately resell it to someone else you cant claim the credit. There are also limits on the buyers income. The purchaser cant have a modified adjusted gross income over 150000 for an individual 300000 for a couple filing jointly or 225000 for a single head of a household. These restrictions will keep many luxury electric vehicle buyers from getting tax credits. The best thing vehicle shoppers can do is ask whether the specific vehicle theyre buying qualifies for a tax credit said Andrew Koblenz vice president for legal and regulatory affairs at the National Automobile Dealers Association. Some vehicle models are made in more than one factory so two identical looking electric SUVs on the same dealer lot might not both qualify or might not qualify for the same amount of credit. Its a great time to be shopping. Its great that there will be more vehicles eligible now but youve still got to make sure the one youre interested in is eligible Koblenz said. You need to ask your dealer and your manufacturer that question and youve got to make sure that you qualify too. CNNs Christine Romans contributed to this story.

They are working on upcoming projects including the Cybertruck the people said adding that Zhus colleagues in China believe he is being groomed for a bigger role at a time when CEO Elon Musk is seeking to overhaul Twitter. Here is a look at Zhu and other key China managers who have helped Teslas Shanghai factory roar back from lockdowns to bring the electric vehicle maker close to its global growth targets for the year. TOM ZHU Zhu who was born in China but now holds a New Zealand passport joined Tesla in 2014. Before that he was a project manager at a company established by his MBA classmates at Duke University advising Chinese contractors working on overseas infrastructure projects. Zhu was overseeing projects for Kaibo Engineering in Libya and Sudan when he was introduced to Cal Lankton then director of global EV charging infrastructure at Tesla. Lankton later hired Zhu to take charge of Teslas charging facility construction in China according to one of the people who is close to Zhu. The people were not authorized to speak to media and declined to be identified. Zhu could not be reached for comment and Telsa did not respond to requests for comment. Zhu took over as China country manager for Tesla at end 2014 when sales of the Model S were declining in the worlds largest auto market. Under Zhu Tesla cars were exempted from traffic restriction rules in major cities such as Beijing and the automaker launched an adapter so the cars could be charged using a revamped Chinese charging standard. The moves boosted Teslas sales in China and its revenue from China more than tripled in 2016 from 2015. During Shanghais twomonth COVID lockdown Zhu was among the first batch of employees sleeping in the factory as they sought to keep it running people who work with him said. After 22 days of shutdown the Shanghai plant resumed partial production with a closed loop system where thousands of workers and suppliers lived and worked in the factory for weeks. Zhu a nofuss manager who sports a buzz cut favors Teslabranded fleece jackets and lives in a governmentsubsidized apartment that is a 10minute drive from the Shanghai Gigafactory. When Tesla posted a picture on Twitter last week to celebrate its Austin Texas plant hitting a production milestone Zhu was among hundreds of workers smiling on the factory floor. ALLAN WANG Allan Wang was promoted to vice president in charge of sales and delivery in China in July according to his Linkedin profile. Since November Tesla has been offering incentives and discounts to buyers in its secondlargest market. Wang who joined Tesla in 2014 worked for Apple and AMD previously. SONG GANG Song Gang has been plant manager of Giga Shanghai since 2018. He was a longtime project engineer at General Motors GM. N and Ford Motor Co F. N before moving to oversee production for Zhidou an EV startup in 2015. Song has been among the Tesla executives who have been traveling with Zhu. Our Standards The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

NVIDIA has announced that its bringing GeForce Now game streaming to cars using the companys Drive platform. The rollout will offer access to titles like Cyberpunk 2077 on a driver display while youre charging or parked or any time from the backseat. That could be more than a little helpful on a vacation especially if youd rather not buy a Steam Deck or Switch for a budding young gamer. The cloud gaming option already has initial support from major brands like the Hyundai group including Genesis and Kia Polestar and Chinas BYD. NVIDIA didnt offer a timeframe for GeForce Now access although it noted that BYD would offer Drive Hyperionpowered cars in the first half of 2023. The Polestar 3 SUV built using Drive Orin arrives in late 2023. The incar GeForce Now client works on either Android or webbased infotainment systems. NVIDIAs service provides a catalog of 1500 games over 1000 of which are playable using gamepads. While most of the selection is paid there are freetoplay options like Destiny 2 and Fortnite. As with other game streaming services this could get costly if you plan to use it often. While basic GeForce Now use is free you can pay up to 200 per year for the full experience before you factor in the cost of the games themselves. In some cases though this might make more sense than buying a handheld console or tablet. You only need to pay for a higherend plan when you expect to use it after all you could subscribe during a road trip and stick to free usage when youre commuting around town.

S. Senate committee asks carmakers about Chinese supply chain WASHINGTON Dec 22 Reuters The U. S. Senate Finance Committee has asked eight major automakers including General Motors GM. N Tesla TSLA. O and Ford Motor F. N to disclose whether any of their components are linked to alleged forced labor use in China according to letters made public on Thursday. In June a U. S. law took effect banning the import of forcedlabor goods from Xinjiang in a pushback against Beijings treatment of Chinas Uyghur Muslim minority which Washington has labeled genocide. Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden wrote the chief executives of major automakers inquiring about Chinese supply chain issues saying it is vital that automakers scrutinize their relationships with all suppliers linked to Xinjiang. Beijing denies abuses in Xinjiang but says it had established vocational training centers to curb terrorism separatism and religious radicalism. The letters which were also sent to Toyota Motor 7203. T Volkswagen VOWGp. DE Chryslerparent Stellantis STLA. MI and MercedesBenz said unless due diligence confirms that components are not linked to forced labor automakers cannot and should not sell cars in the United States that include components mined or produced in Xinjiang. Wyden wants to know whether the automakers have ever canceled or curtailed use of any supplier because of its use of raw materials mining processing or parts manufacturing linked to Xinjiang He cited a new report released earlier this month by researchers at Britains Sheffield Hallam University on the auto industrys use of steel aluminum copper batteries electronics and other components produced in Xinjiang. Between raw materials miningprocessing and auto parts manufacturing we found that practically every part of the car would require heightened scrutiny to ensure that it was free of Uyghur forced labor the report said. GM said Thursday it actively monitors its global supply chain and that its supplier contracts forbid the use of any forced or involuntary labor abusive treatment of employees or corrupt business practices in the supplying of goods and services to GM. Honda said it expects suppliers to follow its global sustainability guidelines with respect to labor. Stellantis said building strong responsible supply chains is an important focus for us and monitors suppliers compliance with its code of conduct through contractual commitments and ongoing evaluations. Volkswagen said it would respond to the Senate letter and emphasized it takes corporate responsibility seriously and rejects forced labor and all forms of modern slavery including human trafficking. The other automakers either did not comment or did not immediately comment. The United Auto Workers UAW union this month called on automakers to shift their entire supply chain out of Chinas Xinjiang region saying the time is now for the auto industry to establish highroad supply chain models outside the Uyghur Region that protect labor and human rights and the environment.

Similar protests by Tesla owners have sprung up in cities including Henan Wuxi and Hangzhou in recent days according to owners and social media posts. Tesla has faced online backlash over previous price cuts in China before but nothing as widespread as the current spontaneous protests. The groups protesting across China were in touch with each other and would continue to press Tesla to offer them some compensation said Damon Yu 29 who bought a Model Y in September.

We trusted the brand so much that we cancelled our orders for other brands for Tesla said Yu who stayed with a group of about 25 protesters at the Tesla Shanghai facility late into Tuesday evening. Several of the owners in Shanghai said they felt misled by Tesla sales staff who had urged them to close orders and told them that they would face higher prices in the new year.
