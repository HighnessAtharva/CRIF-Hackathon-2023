"GM, Ford, Google partner to promote 'virtual' power plants - Reuters","Companies including GM, Ford, Google and solar energy producers said on Tuesday they would work together to establish standards for scaling up the use of virtual power plants (VPPs), systems for easing loads on electricity grids when supply is short.",2023-01-10T12:12:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/gm-ford-google-partner-promote-virtual-power-plants-2023-01-10/,GM Ford Google partner to promote virtual power plants WASHINGTON Jan 10 Reuters Companies including GM Ford Google and solar energy producers said on Tuesday they would work together to establish standards for scaling up the use of virtual power plants VPPs systems for easing loads on electricity grids when supply is short. Energy transition nonprofit RMI will host the initiative the Virtual Power Plant Partnership VP3 which will also aim to shape policy for promoting the use of the systems the companies said. Virtual power plants pool together thousands of decentralized energy resources like electric vehicles or electric heaters controlled by smart thermostats. With permission from customers they use advanced software to react to electricity shortages with such techniques as switching thousands of households batteries like those in EVs from charge to discharge mode or prompting electricityusing devices such as water heaters to back off their consumption. VPPs are positioned for explosive growth in the United States where the 2021 Inflation Reduction Act has created or enlarged tax incentives for electric cars electric water heaters solar panels and other devices whose output and consumption can be coordinated to smooth grid load. RMI estimates that by 2030 VPPs could reduce U. S. peak demand by 60 gigawatts the average consumption of 50 million households and by more than 200 GW by 2050. Virtual power plants will enable grid planners and grid operators to better manage growing electricity demand from vehicles from buildings and from industry and make sure that the grid can stay reliable even in the face of ongoing extreme weather challenges and aging physical infrastructure said Mark Dyson managing director with the carbonfree electricity program at RMI. Rob Threlkeld director of global energy strategy at General Motors GM. N told Reuters that VP3 would be able to show that EVs can become a reliable asset to the retail utility and or the retail transmission operator and can be an asset to a homeowner and to fleet customers. VPPs have already improved grid reliability in such countries as Germany and Australia and in some U. S. states. During an extreme heat wave last August wholesale market operator California Independent System Operator avoided blackouts by calling on all available resources including VPPs to dispatch electricity. Google Nest smart thermostats contributed to easing the load. That is increasingly going to be required to make sure that the grid remains resilient that we avoid blackouts and that we enable the grid to become cleaner and greener said Parag Chokshi director of Googles Nest Renew. Other founding members of VP3 include Ford F. N SunPower SPWR. O and Sunrun RUN. O. Our Standards The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Let me be very clear to the folks out there. You can hear whatever it is Bill 124 is lapsed Ford told reporters at his first news conference of 2023. Two weeks earlier the Ontario government formally filed an appeal of a court decision that found Bill 124legislation that capped pay increases for most public sector workers at one per cent for three yearsto be unconstitutional. A Nov. 29 decision found the bill infringed on the applicants rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining. The same day Fords government indicated it would be appealing the decision. Download our app to get local alerts on your device Get the latest local updates right to your inbox The government argues the court erred in holding that the financial impact of the Acts limits on the compensation increases substantially interferes with the respondents rights to a meaningful process of collective bargaining. They also argued the judge mischaracterized the reason why Bill 124 was put in place to begin with which they say was to manage the provinces finances. The premier reiterated this argument on Wednesday. I always have to be a prudent fiscal manager with the taxpayers money Ford said. We just cant be out there spending willy nilly as people are working their backs off. They are taxed to the brink right now. They cant just keep dishing it out so we have to take everything into consideration. Earlier this year the Financial Accountability Office found the government may have to pay around 8. 4 billion in salaries if the court challenge landed in favour of the workers. However if the appeal is successful the province stands to save about 9. 7 billion in salaries and wages from 2019 through to 20252027 from both unionized and nonunionized employees. Ford was questioned about Bill 124 amid media reports that found the government was aware the legislation could negatively contribute to the healthcare staffing crisis. He argued the claim was not accurate because more than 60000 nurses have been hired since 2018. However Liberal MPP Dr. Adil Shamji says that while nurses are being hired many are also leaving the profession. You can pour water into a bucket but for as long as there are massive holes at the bottom that are allowing water to seep out that bucket will never fill he told CTV News Toronto. Nurses however quickly theyre being brought in are leaving just as quickly. Shamji added that Bill 124 despite what the premier claimed Wednesday is still in effect. There will be negotiations with healthcare worker unions that I understand will take place under Bill 124 he said. The consequences of this legislation will continue to resonate for years to come. The appropriate thing to do is number one not to appeal it in the courts. And number two repeal it immediately. Unions representing healthcare workers have been advocating for better working conditions and pay amid a staffing shortage for most of the pandemic. Ford said Wednesday that his government was looking into options to relieve that burden by having independent health centres with the same standards do some of the work. People dont care where they have to go as long as it has the same regulations. Same top notch doctors that are working in the hospitaland knock off simple stuff Ford said. These are no brainers that are backlogged in the healthcare system.

We were all fans of Ken Block,"Ken Block, who died tragically in a snowmobile accident this week, was an entrepreneur, a racer, and a social media superstar who brought the creativity of skateboarding to the world of cars.",2023-01-04T21:29:30Z,https://www.theverge.com/23539381/ken-block-youtube-skateboard-rally-gymkhana-x-games,Regardless of whether you know it theres a good chance youre a fan of Ken Block. The diversity of the mans accomplishments and the legacy he leaves behind are so broad that even if you only knew him as the dude that slides cars around in those videos Im willing to bet hes had a bigger influence on you than you think. To Blocks oldest fans he was the kid who lived on an avocado grove in Escondido California. His parents moved him there from Long Beach unwittingly dropping him into the heart of the maelstrom of early 80s skateboarding. He was surrounded by a cadre of future professionals in sports that didnt quite exist yet. The friends he made there would change everything. Ken Block had a bigger influence on you than you think If you were into the skate scene in the 90s the era of early superstars like Tony Hawk John Cardiel and Eric Koston youre a fan of Ken Block the clothing entrepreneur. After a brief attempt at becoming a professional snowboarder Block returned to Southern California and dedicated himself to his love of design. He went back to school and started printing Tshirts for friends. One of those friends was Damon Way brother of skateboarding superstar Danny Way. Block and Way founded Droors Clothing each scraping together a 10000 investment. Block borrowed from his parents. Its hard to imagine they had any idea of how big that investment would indirectly pay off. Why indirectly Because it wasnt the clothing that made the brand. The brands clean kicks became de rigueur on the skate scene If you were a fan of DC Shoes in the early 2000s youre a fan of Ken Block the footwear mogul. The brands clean kicks became de rigueur on the skate scene with a focus on quality and durability that set them apart. Block ran the company as president with Damon Way as EVP and it wouldnt be long before the bigger brands came knocking. In 2004 they sold DC Shoes to Quicksilver for nearly 90 million including 56 million in cash. Performance bonuses over the next few years would nearly double that sum. This is when the motorsports side of the story comes in. If you were a fan of North American amateur pointtopoint stage rallying in 2005 youre a fan of Ken Block the racer. Block rolled his DC Shoes success straight into his passion for cars for rally and for Subarus. Just for fun he sourced a rallyprepped 2005 Subaru WRX STI from Vermont SportsCar and used it to place fourth in the inaugural Rally America National Championship winning the Rookie of the Year award. The next year Block formed the Subaru Rally Team USA with Travis Pastrana. The friends traded podium places all season with Pastrana eventually winning the 2006 Rally America Championship and Block coming in second. Stage rallies were still incredibly niche in the USA but thanks largely to those two that style of driving was about to go mainstream. Block rolled his DC Shoes success straight into his passion for cars If you were a fan of X Games motorsports action youre a fan of Ken Block the action sports athlete. The 2006 ESPN X Games XII featured rally driving for the first time with Pastrana and Block taking gold and bronze respectively. The late great Colin McRae took silver famously rolling his own Subaru in the process. If you were a fan of Subarus in that era youre a fan of Ken Block the enthusiast. Though his star was already ascending he still showed up at local meets to hang out and sign posters. Block became an avid member of what was then the largest online forum for Subaruminded misfits the North American Subaru Impreza Owners Club or NASIOC where hed post links to early videos of himself sliding around in his car. If you were a fan of Top Gear in 2009 youre a fan of Ken Block the showman. Really though who wasnt a fan of Top Gear back then The careers of Jeremy Clarkson Richard Hammond and James May still ride the seismic waves of popularity from those years and Blocks appearance on Top Gear series 13 launched this new phase of his own. Block had already released his first socalled gymkhana video the year before humbly dubbed as a practice session in his Crawford Performancebuilt Subaru WRX STI at El Toro airfield in Irvine California filmed by a few friends from school. Though famous in enthusiast circles at the time it was only when Block took Captain Slow for a quick spin that his ticket to superstardom was punched. If youre a fan of gymkhana videos then clearly youre a fan of Ken Block. Before him gymkhanas were obscure at least in America driving events inspired by equestrian pranceoffs something like a lowspeed parking lot autocross with Uturns. Today the word has become virtually synonymous with Block and his DCliveried cars Subarus for the first two iterations before signing a deal with Ford which would take him global. With Ford Block followed his lifetime dream of entering the World Rally Championship. Block campaigned a limited program over four seasons in a WRCspec Ford Fiesta. Only entering a few rounds a year meant hed never stand a chance against competitors whod been rallying full time their entire lives. Nevertheless his tailout driving style earned him a lot of fans. Meanwhile The Gymkhana Files just kept getting bigger and bigger. That first video a prologue really today stands at a healthy 15 million views though that figure is a bit misleading. If youre a fan of aggressively edited action sports clips posted on YouTube it turns out youre a fan of Ken Block too. That first practice gymkhana video that set the template It was initially hosted by Block himself racking up an estimated 30 million streams on his own site. Block was paying so much on hosting fees that he had to ask sponsors to help with the cost. To save costs he eventually uploaded it to YouTube. From there the franchise went stratospheric proving to athletes and sponsors alike that Googles still freshly acquired streaming platform was the place for uploading their antics. As Blocks views increased and The Gymkhana Files profile ballooned the budgets got bigger and bigger. Blocks franchise became as much of an icon in the enthusiast world as the Fast Furious films but unlike that Hollywood blockbuster Block never lost sight of what made them great the cars and the driving. Even a switch to electrification did nothing to dampen anyones enthusiasm. Blocks Hoonitron his first video with new partner Audi raked in 7 million views in just a few months. Blocks franchise became as much of an icon in the enthusiast world as the Fast Furious films All the while Block was becoming a social media superstar with over 8 million followers on Instagram all fans who wanted to come along with whatever vehicular mayhem he was up to. While most people try to look like theyre having fun on social media even when theyre not its hard to believe that Block wasnt truly having a hell of a time. Lately many of his posts were in celebration of his daughter Lia giving us all a great reason to be a fan of Ken Block the father and family man. Lia and the rest of the Block family all have my most sincere condolences. Personally Ill always remember Block as a hardcore rally nerd a humble dude who made it big and lived the dream. I only met him once in 2013 at CES of all places. He was there doing the Ford PR thing and had clearly run out of patience for the dog and pony show well before he arrived for our scheduled interview. Not wanting to make his time any more miserable than it had to be I asked him about rallying about his cars and about the things he loved instead of peppering him with inane questions about tech stuff. It was a great chat even if I gave my producers nothing worth cutting into the CES highlight reel. That creative side is probably what I will be remembered the most for And the man himself what did he think would be his legacy In a 2019 interview with the Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation he said that his racing antics were a huge source of joy in his life but bringing the creativity of skateboarding and snowboarding into the automotive world has probably been the most fun for me and that creative side is probably what I will be remembered the most for. The gifts Block left with the world still feel fresh and fun to watch but hes not done giving yet. His videos and his success will inspire creators producers and athletes to do better for decades. As of a 2019 interview with The Economic Times Block was still calling his gymkhana videos an experiment as if they hadnt yet borne fruit. They have and as more and more people try to fill the massive void Ken Block leaves behind theyll continue to do so for a long time to come.

"Tesla could still fall more than 60% if it's valued as a traditional automaker like Ford or General Motors, CIO says","If Tesla was valued 3x as much as Ford, it would be worth $135 billion, representing an 89% decline from its peak valuation of $1.2 trillion.",2023-01-02T13:30:00Z,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-traditional-automakers-valuation-ford-general-motors-gm-2023-1,Tesla is valued about eight times more than Ford and General Motors even though it makes far fewer cars. Greenwich Capital CIO Vahan Janjigian told CNBC that Tesla would plummet if its valued like a traditional automaker. Tesla saw its worst annual decline on record in 2022 falling more than 60 as investors grew weary of Elon Musks commitment to the company. Should Tesla be valued like a traditional automaker or a tech company That question has been at the center of a yearslong debate between investors and skeptics of the electric vehicle maker as bullish investors focus on its EV innovation selfdriving tech and forays into solar and energy storage as reasons why Tesla deserves a premium valuation to traditional automakers. But one thing is for sure if Tesla ever is valued like Ford or General Motors it has a lot more room to fall according to Greenwich Wealth Management chief investment officer Vahan Janjigian. He told CNBC on Wednesday that even after falling more than 60 in 2022 Tesla is still valued at about eight times more than Ford and General Motors despite selling millions of fewer cars each year. Both Ford and General Motors have a market cap of about 45 billion compared to Teslas valuation of just over 380 billion. In fact even after Tesla erased more than 700 billion in market value this year due to concerns about Elon Musks time commitment to the company its still worth more than the four biggest auto companies combined. Tesla I think is still tremendously overvalued despite its plunge this year... I think Tesla should be selling at a higher multiple than Ford and General Motors because it has much better growth prospects and they dominate the EV market. But this multiple is way too high Janjigian said. Tesla currently trades at a forward PE ratio of 21x compared to 6x and 5x at Ford and General Motors respectively. The only major auto company that has a higher valuation multiple than Tesla is Ferrari which has a gross profit margin thats about double Teslas due to its focus on selling highpriced luxury vehicles. If Tesla were valued by investors more like its automaker peers while maintaining a sizable premium due to its fast growth rate and technological innovations the company could see its value plunge even further according to Janjigian. Tesla is currently selling about 1 million cars per year. That number is going to grow. When I look at Ford which is selling approximately 5 to 6 million cars per year. I think Tesla will get up there so therefore under that argument I think it should be worth at least as much as Ford maybe twice as much as Ford maybe 3x as much as Ford. But 8x as much as Ford I think thats too high Janjigian said. If Tesla fell to a valuation that was three times as much as Ford it would be worth 135 billion. That would represent a 65 decline from current levels and an 89 decline from its peak valuation of more than 1. 2 trillion. Are they going to be the only car seller in the world Are they going to put all these other automobile manufacturers out of business If thats the case then they should be valued higher. But Ford is also making EVs. GM is making EVs. Every single manufacturer now is trying to grow their EV business and they have a lot of years of experience behind them... so I think that they will eventually catch up to Tesla Janjigian said.

The company sold 1864464 vehicles in 2022 down about 2. 2. In contrast sales in 2021 fell about 7. U. S. automakers have been able to sell more cars and trucks than their Asian counterparts following supply chains snags due to COVID19 lockdowns in China last year. General Motors Co GM. N on Wednesday reclaimed the top spot in U. S. auto sales from Toyota Motor Corp 7203. T aided by higher inventory levels. Ford said on Thursday it sold 15617 units of its popular F150 Lightning electric truck in 2022 after they went on sale earlier in the year. The automaker last month raised prices of the cheapest variant of the electric truck for the second time in a span of three months as it navigates higher costs. Shares of Ford which sold an average of at least one FSeries Truck every 49 seconds in 2022 rose as much as 1 in premarket trade before reversing course as broader markets fell. Sales of Fords SUVs including models such as the Explorer and Bronco rose nearly 5 in 2022. Truck sales fell 5. 5 in the year compared with a near 8. 0 drop in 2021. Overall U. S. new vehicle sales in December were 1. 26 million units with an annual sales rate of 13. 31 million according to figures from Wards Intelligence released on Wednesday.

TikTok car-fishing craze leads to closure of ancient Rufford ford,"Council steps in after videos on social media turn Nottinghamshire river crossing into viral tourist attractionDeep in the English countryside is an ancient river crossing that has been used, in various forms, for at least 1,000 years.

It featured in the Domesday Book attracted Cistercian monks who built an abbey nearby and more recently served as a handy shortcut for Nottinghamshire commuters. But Rufford ford has now been closed after clips of cars driving through it attracted hundreds of millions of views on TikTok. That ford has been there since Adam was a lad said Neil Clarke a local councillor. He decided to close the crossing this month after requests from the fire and police services who were unable to cope with a small rural lane becoming one of the most famous roads in the world. With the age of social media it has become a tourist attraction. People are driving there specifically to have a go at going through the ford. They dont realise how deep it is and suddenly their car starts floating Clarke said. Rufford ford cuts across Rainworth Water a small river east of Mansfield. When the weather is dry the river crosses the road as a small trickle that is easily traversed. But after heavy rain it becomes several feet deep and up to 30ft 9 metres wide and the crossing resembles a log flume at a theme park. Overoptimistic drivers have a moment of realisation as their cars are turned into a boat. As their engines fill up with water they are left begging onlookers to tow them out. For years this was a local concern. Then in 2020 a local teenager called Ben Gregory started uploading videos he had filmed to YouTube of cars conking out in the water. Suddenly a small Nottinghamshire lane was a global tourist attraction with an obsessive fanbase. People love seeing pain and failure said another YouTuber who insisted on being referred to by his online username midlifecrisis101x. They dont want to seeing people winning. What they want to do is to watch idiots and go Im having a really bad day but hes having a worse one. This 50yearold YouTuber has spent months filming at the ford alongside Gregory. He said audiences delighted in watching other people failing. Its wanton stupidity. Youve got a perfectly good motor vehicle and a sign that says road closed. Why are you going to put your car in that Capturing a car failing can take hours of time with the YouTubers filming hundreds of crossings before getting footage that elicits peak schadenfreude such as a waterlogged BMW or Mercedes. It is relaxing there its like fishing. But youre fishing for cars midlifecrisis101x said. As for the motivation of those crossing the river he believes there is a deep bloodlust on the part of drivers who want to drive a vehicle worth tens of thousands of pounds through a flooded ford. Its like when somebody knows theyre about to do something wrong they wont look around and they carry on and do it anyway. The global interest in Rufford ford quickly became hard to manage. Large crowds turned up on the narrow treelined country lane parking their cars and bringing their families to spend a day cheering drivers attempting the crossing. Local businesses did a strong trade in icecreams. Nottinghamshire police had to divert officers to manage numbers. Other YouTubers and influencers turned up creating a bank of cameras filming every crossing. Occasionally the fire service had to send staff to help pull cars out. Midlifecrisis101x said I had a guy come over from Germany and spend a week in his car in the car park. Twice. Hed just sit there with his supply of food and watch. The videos became valuable YouTube content with the creators receiving a cut of the sites advertising revenue earning tens of thousands of pounds. But the crowd control really began to get out of control over the course of this year as the videos made their way from a core loyal audience on YouTube to TikTok where algorithmdriven recommendations drove millions of new viewers to the mill. This intense attention provided by TikTok according to midlifecrisis101x resulted in a change in the type of person who was coming to the ford. TikTok attracts a more excitable audience who want instant entertainment they want 15 to 20 seconds of highadrenaline consumption. The highenergy people came to Rufford ford. It was originally fishing for cars and then TikTok brought more energy and not in a good way. Clarke who is the cabinet member responsible for highways and environment at Nottinghamshire county council said crowds were encroaching on the road and it was becoming a public safety hazard. We had complaints saying were spoiling everyones fun. Im sure its great entertainment and people go to watch the spectacle but I dont think people realise theres a lot of danger and hazard. Very quickly things like this can change to a tragedy. The councillor said the evergrowing online attention had caused people to attempt riskier crossings in recent months. There was a motorcyclist who approached it at 50mph went full pelt and came straight off head over heels over the handlebars. He went so fast he bounced all the way along the water before collapsing on the other side in a heap. It is lifethreatening. For now locals will have to wait while the council decides what to do with the accidentally viral road crossing. Clarke said a replacement bridge was out of the question on cost grounds but traffic calming measures are being considered. Meanwhile the group of Rufford ford YouTubers are convinced theyve tapped into strong demand for online content about cars driving through water and hope to recreate their camaraderie at a new site. It is a beautiful location and other fords arent the same said midlifecrisis101x. But thats why were focusing on the chemistry onscreen.
Francis Ford Coppola denies report his new film set is ‘chaos’,"Film-maker disputes article claiming his self-financed film Megalopolis has descended into ‘madness’, saying: ‘I’m so happy’Francis Ford Coppola has denied allegations in the Hollywood Reporter that the set of his ambitious new film Megalopolis has descended …",2023-01-10T21:31:58Z,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/10/francis-ford-coppola-megalopolis-movie-chaos-response,Francis Ford Coppola has denied allegations in the Hollywood Reporter that the set of his ambitious new film Megalopolis has descended into chaos. On Monday a report claimed that the director of Apocalypse Now was struggling to maintain control over his new film a selffinanced passion project with a budget north of 100m. The article used multiple unnamed sources who alleged that the set was absolute madness with high staff turnover an escalating budget and visual effects issues. A production source was quoted as saying Its unclear whether the production can go forward as planned. In an interview with Deadline Coppola admits that there have been staffing issues the original article claimed he fired almost the entire visual effects team in December while the art department resigned but that the shoot has been mostly smooth so far. Ive never worked on a film where I was so happy with the cast Coppola said. I am so happy with the look and that we are so on schedule. These reports never say who these sources are. To them I say ha ha just wait and see. Because this is a beautiful film and primarily so because the cast is so great. Ive never enjoyed working with a cast who are so hardworking and so willing to go search for the unconventional to come upon hidden solutions. It is a thrill to work with these actors and the photography is everything I could hope for. The dailies are great. So if were on schedule and I love the actors and the look is great I dont know what anyones talking about here. The longgestating scifi project stars Adam Driver Nathalie Emmanuel Aubrey Plaza Forest Whitaker and Dustin Hoffman. The plot revolves around an architect rebuilding New York after a financial crisis cripples the city. Coppola has compared it to a Roman epic that is very current and realistic. Driver also chose to release a statement Id like to briefly respond to the Hollywood Reporter article published Monday January 9th. All good here Not sure what set youre talking about I dont recognize that one Ive been on sets that were chaotic and this one is far from it. He went on to say that the only madness Ive observed is that more productions arent allowed to be as creatively wild and experimentally focused. Coppola told Deadline that the film will be finished this spring and is totally on schedule. His goal is to open the film across the world on the same day and utilise Imaxsize screens. Every night I go see the dailies and I understand why I am going through all of this he added. I love what I see every night. The look of the film is exactly what I dreamed. The directors last film was 2011 horror Twixt starring Val Kilmer and Elle Fanning. The Guardians Catherine Shoard called it predictable and mumbled.
Ozy Media sued in N.Y. court over $1.3 mln legal tab - Reuters,A New York law firm is suing Ozy Media Inc to recoup what it said is nearly $1.3 million in fees and expenses that the digital media company owes for legal work related to U.S. federal investigations and other matters.,2022-12-23T18:39:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/ozy-media-sued-ny-court-over-13-mln-legal-tab-2022-12-23/,Ozy Media sued in N. Y. court over 1. 3 mln legal tab Summary Companies Related documents Law firm Ford OBrien filed suit in New York state court Ozy hired firm for U. S. investigations other matters complaint says Dec 23 Reuters A New York law firm is suing Ozy Media Inc to recoup what it said is nearly 1. 3 million in fees and expenses that the digital media company owes for legal work related to U. S. federal investigations and other matters. Litigationfocused Ford OBrien Landy sued Ozy Media on Dec. 21 in New York state court claiming that the embattled company only partially paid legal invoices and failed to follow through on assurances that it would pay up. The lawsuit did not reveal the substance of the investigations but said they involved a federal prosecutors office in New York and the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Ford OBrien said in the lawsuit that the firm helped produce 160000 pages of records in response to U. S. subpoenas. Ford OBrien lawyers also worked on a private civil case in California federal court defending Ozy after an investment fund in October 2021 accused it and cofounder Samir Rao of alleged fraud according to the lawsuit and court dockets. A New York Times report a month earlier said Rao impersonated a YouTube executive during a call with thenprospective investor Goldman Sachs. The firm was weighing a 40 million investment in the media company. Goldman Sachs ultimately opted not to invest. Lawyers for Ozy have called the impersonation an isolated incident that was immediately acknowledged and addressed by the company. Following the report LifeLine Legacy Holdings LLC sued Ozy to withdraw investments of 2. 25 million in Ozy. The case was voluntarily dismissed last month. In Ford OBriens Dec. 21 complaint partner Kevin OBrien wrote that Ozy Media had never objected to the invoices that the law firm issued for its work. To the contrary Ozy Media has repeatedly acknowledged its debts and promised to pay the complaint said. Representatives from Ozy founded in 2013 and based in Mountain View California did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. OBrien declined to comment on Friday. The law firm said Ozy put down 200000 at the start of the legal work in 2021 but paid only a portion of the invoices as they came due and thus quickly started to fall behind on its payment obligations. OBrien said in a retention agreement that he charged 950 an hour. The case is Ford OBrien Landy v. Ozy Media Inc New York Supreme Court County of New York No. 6549562022.

Acceptance at the newfangled technology was slow at first but over the past ten years as battery capacities have grown and range anxieties have shrunk electric vehicles have become a daily sight in most parts of the country. Doesnt hurt that virtually every notable automaker on the planet has jumped on the electric bandwagon with sizable investments in battery and production technologies as well as pledges to electrify their lineups within a decade or so. Not even recent years production slowdowns and supply chain disruptions brought on by the COVID pandemic managed to stall the industrys momentum. The International Energy Agency in January reported that EVs had managed to triple their market share between 2019 and 2021 with 6. 6 million units being sold globally last year. Thats not to discount the crippling impacts of the chip shortage which saw fleets of nearlyfinished electrified vehicles parked and idled as they awaited necessary components. Or in Teslas case simply sold without the needed part oh calm down its just the steering column theres nothing critical in there anyway thats what autopilot is for right 2022 has eliminated any lingering doubts about whether EVs are here to stay hint they are. So far in 2022 global EV sales are up 70 percent or around 2 million units from 2021s figures according to Morgan Stanley. It is expecting a further 22 percent increase around another 1. 8 million units in 2023. Chinas BYD set monthly EV sales records throughout the year. Domestically an Experian study released in October noted more than 600000 new EV registrations through the first ten months of 2022 a 60 percent yearoveryear jump. EVs may not be quite as ruggedized as their hybrid cousins but who cares about that when youve got Ken Lets See If I Can Barrel Roll This Car Block blowing the doors off of the Vegas Strip in an 800V Audi S1 Hoonitron Or have VW tickling the American publics deep seated nostalgia with a reimagined Hippy Wagon for the 21st century Even Sony is getting into the EV game. EVs are no longer niche theyve become an indelible part of the culture. In terms of market share Tesla and BYD both retained their dominant positions within their relative markets and briefly jockeyed for the world number one spot before BYD pulled away. The Chinese automakers EV sales now account for nearly 20 percent of the global total. For its part Tesla passed notable milestones in its 10000th Model Y produced at the Texas Gigafactory and the millionth vehicle to roll out of production at Gigafactory Shanghai. 2022 also saw big moves and bigger investments from the rest of the automotive industry from Ford and General Motors especially. Ford began delivering its highlyanticipated F150 Lightning EV pickup in May turned them into roving conference rooms with help from Cisco began beta testing their bidirectional charging capabilities with Californias public utility as did GM developed a new battery chemistry announced plans to bring seven more EV models to the European market by 2024 and imagined a world without dealer showrooms for EV sales. General Motors had a banner year of its own. The company began production on its new marquee Lyriq EV unveiled its Yukon Denali Silverado Blazer and Celestiq EVs teased its upcoming Corvette hybrid and secured a sizable federal loan to expand its battery manufacturing base. Not to be left out Hyundai announced in 2022 a 5 billion investment in its USbased production capacity including a new EV factory in Georgia. The Korean automaker which has quietly risen to prominence in the US market in recent years announced its next EV flagship the Ioniq 6 in July the latest in Hyundais effort to release 17 electric vehicle models by the end of the decade. Kia Hyundais sister brand showed off the companys brawnier EV6 GT at Monterey Car Week. VWs 2022 was fruitful as well and it appears that the automaker has fully embraced its electrified future following the dieselgate scandal how could it not. VW opened a new ID. 4 production plant in Tennessee announced plans to invest an additional 7. 1 billion into its North American production capacity over the next five years and dipped its toes into the EV battery business as well. Pfft all Volvo did this year was debut the safest car ever. And it wasnt just the established brands Lucid Motors is riding high this holiday season buoyed by the November unveiling of its new top of the line Air Sapphire along with two ahem relatively less expensive Air model variants which will start at 87000 with 410 miles of range and go up from there. The company also revealed plans this year to sell 100000 units to the Saudi government which has heavily invested in the company. 2022 also saw a drastic expansion of the nations various fast charging networks. In June the Biden White House proposed a set of standards for the national EV charging network. The following month GM announced that it will partner with EVGo to create a 500station coasttocoast fastcharge network and in December opened its first two Community Charging Initiative sites in Wisconsin and Detroit. Hertz fresh off two significant purchase contracts with Polestar and GM revealed it is working with BP to host the latters BP Pulse chargers at select Hertz car rental locations not unlike what VW and BP have planned for Europe. Similarly IKEA will team up with Electrify America to bring EAs fast charging network to the Swedish homeware makers parking lots. Perhaps most exciting the White House in July confirmed rumors that Tesla would be opening its expansive North American SuperCharger network to nonTesla EVs by the end of the year thats an additional 1700plus charging points for drivers to fill up at. But 2022 wasnt all smooth asphalt and sunshine. Rivian fell on hard times this year struggling with production issues layoffs price hikes lawsuits in response to said price hikes followed by reversals of said price hiles delays to the R1S delivery schedule and trim level cullings. Rivian performed so badly in 2022 that it dragged Fords stock value down alongside it but it was still a better year than Lordstown had. And hey at least they didnt use the tip of their tongue to test for live wires like BMW did in July when it tried to paywall access to seat heaters that vehicle owners had already paid for. Even Mercedes had the good sense to charge 1200 a year only for funtime performance extras like added torque and a shortened 060 rather than essential capabilities like retaining rearend sensation on cold winter mornings. We also saw significant pricing fluctuations in EVs this year. Tesla raised prices across the board for its entire lineup as did Polestar with its single motor variant while VW dropped the price of its 2023 ID. 4 by around 4000 thanks to its use of a slightly smaller battery pack. For as eventful as 2022 turned out to be 2023 and beyond is sure to be even bigger for the EV industry. Were expecting debuts of the VW ID. 3 the Lucid Gravity Polestar 3 Jeep one of four and Honda Prologue SUVs. The Kia EV9 is slated for release in the second half of the year while the Buick Wildcat wont be realized until 2024. With any luck these EVs will serve merely as stopgaps until Volkswagen can perfect its Gen. Travel concept and begin shuttling us around in automated transport pods. Like WallE but just as fat.
"U.S. auto sales to fall in 2022, GM set to reclaim top spot from Toyota - Reuters","U.S. new vehicle sales are expected to decline for major automakers in 2022 due to inventory shortages, which weighed on Asian brands more than the Detroit giants such as General Motors Co <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/companies/GM.N"" target=""_blank"">(GM.N…",2023-01-04T11:12:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-auto-sales-fall-2022-gm-set-reclaim-top-spot-toyota-2023-01-04/,GM reclaims U.

Inventory shortages stemming from surging material costs and a persistent chip crunch had hobbled production at many automakers keeping car and truck prices elevated. Asian brands were hit hardest. Toyota is still among the tightest when it comes to inventory Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough said. The Japanese automaker cut its fullyear production target in November. Sales of its SUVs a key segment fell 8. 6 in 2022 data on Wednesday showed. However Toyota executives said there were some positive signs emerging and the rate of inventory buildup was slow but steady. Were optimistic our inventory levels will continue to improve in the first quarter and for the remainder of the year said Andrew Gillel senior vice president of automotive operations at Toyota. Other brands such as Hyundai Motor America Kia Motors America Mazda North American Operations and American Honda all posted a drop in sales on Wednesday. U. S. new vehicle sales in December finished at 1. 26 million units with an annual sales rate of 13. 31 million according to Wards Intelligence data. Analysts are concerned that price hikes by automakers to blunt inflationary pressures and rising interest rates will take a toll on new vehicle sales in 2023. Affordability is a very real issue Toyota executive David Christ said. Nonetheless the company expects demand to be robust this year. Automakers will need to begin incentivising buyers a trend that was paused during the pandemic automotive marketplace TrueCar said. Our Standards The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

S. Senate committee asks carmakers about Chinese supply chain WASHINGTON Dec 22 Reuters The U. S. Senate Finance Committee has asked eight major automakers including General Motors GM. N Tesla TSLA. O and Ford Motor F. N to disclose whether any of their components are linked to alleged forced labor use in China according to letters made public on Thursday. In June a U. S. law took effect banning the import of forcedlabor goods from Xinjiang in a pushback against Beijings treatment of Chinas Uyghur Muslim minority which Washington has labeled genocide. Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden wrote the chief executives of major automakers inquiring about Chinese supply chain issues saying it is vital that automakers scrutinize their relationships with all suppliers linked to Xinjiang. Beijing denies abuses in Xinjiang but says it had established vocational training centers to curb terrorism separatism and religious radicalism. The letters which were also sent to Toyota Motor 7203. T Volkswagen VOWGp. DE Chryslerparent Stellantis STLA. MI and MercedesBenz said unless due diligence confirms that components are not linked to forced labor automakers cannot and should not sell cars in the United States that include components mined or produced in Xinjiang. Wyden wants to know whether the automakers have ever canceled or curtailed use of any supplier because of its use of raw materials mining processing or parts manufacturing linked to Xinjiang He cited a new report released earlier this month by researchers at Britains Sheffield Hallam University on the auto industrys use of steel aluminum copper batteries electronics and other components produced in Xinjiang. Between raw materials miningprocessing and auto parts manufacturing we found that practically every part of the car would require heightened scrutiny to ensure that it was free of Uyghur forced labor the report said. GM said Thursday it actively monitors its global supply chain and that its supplier contracts forbid the use of any forced or involuntary labor abusive treatment of employees or corrupt business practices in the supplying of goods and services to GM. Honda said it expects suppliers to follow its global sustainability guidelines with respect to labor. Stellantis said building strong responsible supply chains is an important focus for us and monitors suppliers compliance with its code of conduct through contractual commitments and ongoing evaluations. Volkswagen said it would respond to the Senate letter and emphasized it takes corporate responsibility seriously and rejects forced labor and all forms of modern slavery including human trafficking. The other automakers either did not comment or did not immediately comment. The United Auto Workers UAW union this month called on automakers to shift their entire supply chain out of Chinas Xinjiang region saying the time is now for the auto industry to establish highroad supply chain models outside the Uyghur Region that protect labor and human rights and the environment.

But if you arent completely tired of hearing him deliver headlinegrabbing soundbites head over to Empire to read a new interview which uses the fun gimmick of getting other famous people to ask him questions. Theres some amusing stuffCameron telling Edgar Wright not to sweat the Titanic parody he once made May we all be blessed with making films that get spoofs Harrison Ford and Pierce Brosnan asking why hes never cast them in anything Cameron is a fan of both actors but my great regret as a filmmaker is that I take so long to make my films that I only ever get to work with a tiny fraction of the artists that I respect and Cameron giving his take on the Papyrus font Saturday Night Live sketch in response to a question asked by the fonts actual creator. There are many questions about Terminator and The Abyss and Cameron confirming for Carrie Henn the former child actor who played Newt in Aliens that The Wizard of Oz is his favorite movie. Of particular interest however is the question from RRRs S. S. Rajamouliwho knows a thing or two about directing threehour action epics. He asked Cameron if he regrets spending so much time in the world of Avatar in the sense that it has prevented him from telling other stories and exploring other ideas. Two thoughts in answer to your question the first is that the world of Avatar is so sprawling that I can tell most of the stories I want to tell within it and try many of the stylistic techniques that I hope to explore Cameron responded. And secondly yes our time as artists is finite. I will always mourn some of the stories that I dont get to make. But I feel a great satisfaction when other directors want to explore some of my ideas like Kathryn Bigelow did with Strange Days and Robert Rodriguez did when I passed him the baton on Alita Battle Angel. I look forward to more collaborations in the future with directors I admire. Read the whole interview piece at Empire featuring an array of questions from people youd expect Robert Rodriguez Zoe Saldaa and more random admirers including the showrunners of The Lord of the Rings The Rings of Power and Stranger Things.

Kevin McCarthys bid for House Speaker. The two have been friendly for years Musk has donated to McCarthys campaign five times and attended the California Republicans donors retreat last year as McCarthys personal guest. McCarthy has called Musk the Thomas Edison of our time and run political interference on his behalf. Musk tweeted out his support for McCarthy on Thursday morning hours before the House of Representatives was set to reconvene to try to elect a Speaker for a seventh time. Kevin McCarthy should be Speaker Musk said via his social network. Musks support of McCarthy who has already lost six consecutive votes to become Speaker this week aligns with the billionaires pivot to the political right in recent months. Most recently Musk recommended that people vote Republican in the midterms. Although the Tesla CEO isnt a big political donor he has made donations to McCarthys campaigns at least five times according to Federal Election Commission records albeit in small amounts no more than 2700. In August of last year Musk attended McCarthys annual donor retreat in Wyoming as the Republicans personal guest. At the event McCarthy introduced Musk as the Thomas Edison of our time Axios reported. Its not clear whether Musks support McCarthy will do any good. The California Republican is dealing with 20 hardright defectors who refuse to vote for him. Even McCarthys endorsement from former President Donald Trump has failed to sway the hardliners so its hard to believe that Musks seal of approval would be any different. The House is scheduled to reconvene at noon ET. The House Republican also spoke up on behalf of Musk in November telling reporters that the White House should stop picking on Elon Musk after White House officials said they were keeping an eye on Musks reforms at Twitter. That is offensive to me. Governments going to go after someone that wants to have free speech. What do they have to look at Twitter about McCarthy said on Nov. 29. I think the American public have spoken on this. I think our First Amendment stands up and I think they should stop picking on Elon Musk. McCarthys praise and defense of Musk stands in stark contrast to President Joe Bidens administration which Musks feels has snubbed him by ignoring Tesla. Biden has repeatedly praised automakers like Ford and GM for their innovation in electric vehicles since taking office but he hasnt mentioned Tesla.

Its not common for private citizens to sue the government and have their day in court. In his Dec. 20 motion of certification Justice Edward Belobaba said he believes there is enough legal analysis to support at least an arguable chance of success for the tort claim against the Minister of LongTerm Care MLTC. In making the decision Belobaba referenced a report by the LongTerm Care Commission that found the province demonstrated a lack of urgency and delayed implementing several key measures. He also quoted microbiologist Dr. Dick Zoutman who suggested that 3836 longterm care COVID19 deathsas well as 23000 infectionswere largely preventable. While the plaintiffs which includes four Ontario residents whose parent died of COVID19 in longterm care have had no direct interactions with the minister Belobaba argues the preamble in the LongTerm Care Home Act could provide a basis for the tort claim. Preamble does say that the government arguably the MLTC has a duty to take action in circumstances where the care safety security and rights of residents might be compromised he wrote. Belobaba argues it would be just and reasonable to impose a duty on the MLTC to take action without delay when the lives of longterm care residents are clearly at risk. The Justice also found that by alleging gross negligence the plaintiffs could circumvent the Supporting Ontarios Recovery Act which prevents COVID19related lawsuits. At the same time Belobaba noted the class action would be challenging at best.

He said that historically the government is protected from liability meaning that litigation such as this has a higher bar to reach than other proceedings. There is recognition that not all government conduct can and should be shielded from legal consequences it is not only at the ballot box that government will be held accountable he said in a written statement to CTV News Toronto. This decision is certainly an important addition to the canon of law that allows plaintiffs to hold the government to account through civil litigation particularly for grossly negligent conduct that resulted in the unnecessary loss of life of over 5000 of our most vulnerable citizens. Seniors were by far the hardesthit demographic during the COVID19 pandemic with nearly 4000 people dying prior to the release of a 322page report by the LongTerm Care Commission on April 30 2021. The report cited a lack of adequate testing and personal protective equipment as well as improper cohorting an a general failure to recognize the risks posed by COVID19. The minister of longterm care said at the time the government worked as fast as it could to prevent the spread of infection. You know I think the government measures and processes we were trying to move fast.. and COVID19 was moving faster Merrilee Fullerton said in May 2021. Rochon said the government has filed notice that it intends to appeal the decision which could add another six to 10 months to the class actions timeline. If the court decides that there will not be an appeal we proceed with the next steps in litigation which will involve what will likely be a lengthy documentary and oral discovery process he said. The government confirmed it sent its notice of appeal on Jan. 4. Speaking to reporters Wednesday afternoon Ontario Premier Doug Ford said his government is pushing back because they disagree with the claims in the lawsuit. Everyone pitched in. Every business every person every healthcare worker. We gave it our all 1000 per cent Ford said. Did we have some challenges Sure we did like the whole world did. Did we perform extremely well through the pandemic. we were phenomenal if you want to do comparisons across the world.

U.S. NTSB chair raises safety concerns about heavy electric vehicles - Reuters,U.S. National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy on Wednesday raised concerns about the increased risk of severe injury and death from heavier electric vehicles on U.S. roads.,2023-01-11T22:14:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-ntsb-chair-raises-safety-concerns-about-heavy-electric-vehicles-2023-01-11/,U. S. NTSB chair raises safety concerns about heavy electric vehicles WASHINGTON Jan 11 Reuters U. S. National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy on Wednesday raised concerns about the increased risk of severe injury and death from heavier electric vehicles on U. S. roads. She cited a General Motors GM. N GMC Hummer EV that weighs over 9000 pounds up from about 6000 pounds for the gasoline version and the Ford F150 Lightning EV F. N which is between 2000 and 3000 pounds heavier than the nonelectric version. The heavier weight has a significant impact on safety for all road users she said Wednesday in a speech. We have to be careful that we arent also creating unintended consequences more death on our roads. GM said safety is at the cornerstone at everything we do. All GM vehicles are engineered to meet or exceed all applicable motor vehicle safety standards. Ford did not immediately comment. Homendys comments come as the U. S. has seen a sharp rise in traffic deaths since the start of the COVID19 pandemic and U. S. vehicles get keep getting larger on average. The Environmental Protection Agency said last month average new vehicle weight and horsepower both hit new records in 2021 with average vehicle weight hitting 4289 pounds in 2021 as SUV and truck sales rise and both are forecast to hit new records in 2022. U. S. traffic deaths jumped 10. 5 in 2021 to 42915 the largest number killed on American roads in a year since 2005 after rising 7 in 2020 and declined slightly in the first nine months of 2022 but remain high. Acting NHTSA Administrator Ann Carlson told reporters Monday that the agency was studying the impact of vehicle size on roadway safety. Carlson said the agency was very concerned about the degree to which heavier vehicles contribute to greater fatality rates. She noted that some subscribe to the mantra that bigger is safer but that did not necessarily take into account other factors. Bigger is safer if you dont look at the communities surrounding you and you dont look at the other vehicles on the road Carlson said. It actually turns out to be a very complex interaction.

Elon Musk Went From Being Like Henry Ford in a Good Way to a Bad Way,This isn’t the first time a carmaker has endangered his empire just to share his bad takes.,2023-01-10T10:45:00Z,https://slate.com/technology/2023/01/elon-musk-henry-ford-twitter-history-nazis.html,Running a car company has to feel a little dull once youve become one of the richest people on the planet. But your wealth gives you options. You could buy a media platform for instance where you might bully a marginalized group or forge new friendships with fringe characters. Sharing halfbaked views on international affairs works too when youre this rich even your most reprehensible takes get serious attention. But be warned All of this might be fun for you but it could spell disaster for the car company that generated your riches in the first place. Im talking of course about Henry Ford the founder of the car company that bears his name. It would be hard to overstate his influence over corporate America and the national zeitgeist a century agoor the damage he ultimately inflicted on both his company and the country. The resemblance to a certain publicitycraving South Africaborn billionaire is more than fleeting. But there are some important differences especially in their early years. Unlike Elon Musk Ford did not grow up rich he was raised on a farm in rural Michigan. Ford met his wife and loyal companion Clara Jane Bryant when he was 20 he called their wedding the greatest day of my life. Musks romantic and family life is more um complicated. And only Ford actually founded the car company that made him one of the most famous people in the world. Thanks to a lawsuit settlement Musk is allowed to call himself a cofounder. Fords business accomplishments are the stuff of legend. In the early 20 th century he brought to car manufacturing two transformative ideas interchangeable parts and the assembly line. Together they turbocharged his companys production rates enabling Ford to reduce the price of its flagship Model T by more than twothirds between 1908 and 1925 when it cost 260 about 4400 today. At one point over half of all cars in the world were Model Ts. Musk for his part is credited with making electric vehicles cool instead of dorky. Starting with the release of the Roadster in 2008 Teslas sales of electric cars have dwarfed those of its competitors. The company has capitalized on several innovative business tactics such as selling directly to consumers issuing overtheair software updates and offering house calls from vehicle technicians. Tesla has loosely followed Musks famous 2006 master plan of designing highend EVs before moving downmarket with more affordable models. That said Teslaunlike Fordhas not come close to producing a true vehicle for the masses unless you count the 46000plus youll pay for a Model 3 before incentives. At age 50 Musk was named Times Person of the Year in 2021. Ford too seemed to be on top of the world when he turned 50 in 1913 as the Model T was transforming the country. His 1914 promise of a 5 workday drew thousands of young men from Midwestern farms to Detroit helping to make Ford himself a topic of national fascination. He became the recognizable face of the automobile industry producing a wildly popular product that suggested a thrilling future of transportation. According to Heather Barrows book Henry Fords Plan for the American Suburb Ford poohpoohed transit claiming that subways would eventually be used to park cars. That suggests yet another parallel with Musk who once said I think public transport is painful. It sucks. Thus far his vision of subterranean autonomous tunnels has produced a single 1. 5mile track used by Las Vegas conference attendees who ride inside Teslaswith human drivers. But then Henry Fords life took a grim turn toward bigotry. In 1918 Ford bought a local newspaper the Dearborn Independent. At a time when hundreds of thousands of Jews were fleeing pogroms in Europe the paper published a torrent of vicious antisemitism such as the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion and a series titled The International Jew The Worlds Problem. According to Steven Watts book The Peoples Tycoon the resulting backlash included condemnation from former presidents William Taft and Woodrow Wilson and at least one Ford dealership in Iowa ending its relationship with the company. Musk for his part bought Twitter last year and now wields it as a weapon against the woke mind virus. Transgender people have been a frequent target Musk tweeted that pronouns suck and last month the San Francisco Chronicle accused him of leaning into transphobia. Musks politicization of Twitter and embrace of the right seem to be taking a toll on Teslas business much as disgusted Jews once refused to buy Fords. And then there are international affairs an area where Musk has recently dabbled disastrously. Here too Henry Ford did it first. Given Fords loathing of Jews his affinity for Nazi Germany is hardly surprising. In 1938 Ford became the first American to accept the Third Reichs top honor for a foreigner the Grand Cross of the Supreme Order of the German Eagle. The warm feelings were reciprocated Hitler at one point kept a portrait of Ford in his office calling him my inspiration. In his book Watts describes how Ford did everything he could to keep the United States out of World War II including authoring articles touting isolationism and joining Charles Lindbergh in the infamous America First Committee that blamed the United Kingdom and Jews for trying to drag the U. S. into war. Ford infuriated the Roosevelt administration by reneging on an agreement to manufacture engines for Great Britain only after Pearl Harbor did Ford quietly change course converting the companys factories for wartime production. Musk too has developed warm relations with some of the most despicable people of his era. Since buying Twitter he has invited Nazis back to the platform where he has also engaged in friendly banter with Vladimir Putins top allies. Epic thread he recently tweeted in response to former Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedevs New Years predictions which included a civil war breaking out in the U. S. A few months ago Musk proposed a peace plan for the war in Ukraine that received praise from the Kremlin but condemnation from virtually everyone else. Like many on the far right his disdain for Dr. Anthony Fauci seems to border on obsession. With Tesla shares tumbling 65 percent in 2022 Musks growing involvement in media and politics has done his car company no favors. With much of his wealth comprised of Tesla stock Musk recently became the first person in history to lose 200 billion. His companys lead among EV makers once seemed insurmountable but not anymore. A century ago Fords carmaking dominance faded along with its founders focus on his core business. For years Henry Ford resisted calls to overhaul the Model T. When he finally did launching the Model A in 1927 it was too late Ford had already ceded market share to competitors like General Motors and Chrysler. The companys struggles continued during the 1930s when Henry Ford relied on a private police force to battle workers trying to unionize. Musk too has shown no love for organized labor. It was only in the 1940s as Henry Fords behavior became increasingly erratic and the companys finances teetered that he was finally forced to hand over the reins. He could now fill his time with an array of passion projects that ranged from watchmaking to farming to constructing Greenfield Village his collection of historic American buildings that included Thomas Edisons laboratory and the Wright Brothers bicycle shop. As for Musk Now might be a good time for him to focus on a few hobbies too. Lucas Peilert provided research assistance.

Grzegorz Pierzchala is home after a procession carried his body along Highway 400 to Barrie where he will have a police funeral Jan. 4. About 80 people lined the Bayfield Street overpass with many saluting as the procession of police vehicles drove under each highway overpass before exiting at Duckworth Street to take Pierzchala to a funeral home. The 28yearold OPP officer was killed Dec. 27 while responding to a call west of Hagersville. Police say Pierzchala responded to a call for a vehicle in a ditch just west of Hagersville on Tuesday afternoon and was shot dead when he got there. A 28yearold man and a 30yearold woman have been charged with firstdegree murder in relation to the shooting. The procession left the Centre of Forensic Sciences in Toronto around 9 a. m. and travelled north on Highway 400 to Barrie where mourners and those looking to pay their respects stood on each of the citys overpasses. Karen Lebal was among them. She said she didnt know Pierzchala but noted he was only two years older than her daughter. I cant imagine what that family is going through. To lose him so suddenly for no damn reason that is good enough is just unbearable said Lebal. Ill line the street with my family when we know more details on the funeral. An OPP spokesperson said on Friday details of the funeral cannot yet be confirmed. Pierzchala had been with the force for just more than a year and he had been notified he had passed his 10month probation period hours before his death. Police say he was previously a special constable at Queens Park who as a boy dreamed of joining the police ranks. Craig Head is the chaplain with Barrie Police Service. He said he was there to show his support and he hopes others always do the same. This is too many lineofduty deaths that weve had across the country and of course close to home said Head. This is horrendous to be murdered in cold blood and we need to support our officers. On Oct. 11 South Simcoe Police Service constables Devon Northrup and Morgan Russell were shot and killed while responding to a disturbance at a home in the area of 25th Sideroad and 9th Line in Innisfil. The officers were shot inside the home according to police and the suspect was later pronounced dead following an interaction with police. Their funeral was held at the Sadlon Arena and was attended by thousands of officers from around North America.

Const. Grzegorz Greg Pierzchala 28 was killed Tuesday afternoon when responding to a call about a vehicle in a ditch near Hagersville Ont. The procession for Pierzchala will depart from the Centre of Forensic Sciences in Toronto at 900 a. m. and travel northbound on Highway 400 to Barrie where he will be laid to rest. Members of the public are invited to join First Responders in showing their respects from one of the many overpasses along the highway. Please do not stop on the highway to exit your vehicle as this poses a serious safety concern the OPP said in a news release on Thursday. CP24. com will stream the procession live. A police funeral will be held in Barrie on Jan. 4. The OPP said details will be announced once they have been finalized. On Wednesday two suspects Randall McKenzie 25 from the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation and Brandi StewartSperry 30 from Hamilton were charged with firstdegree murder in the death of Pierzchala. OPP Commissioner Thomas Carrique said McKenzie had been banned from owning any firearms for life since 2018. In addition McKenzie was charged with several firearmsrelated offences and assaulting a police officer in 2021. McKenzie was released on bail on a number of conditions and was supposed to answer to the charges back in September but failed to attend court. A warrant was later issued for his arrest. Both McKenzie and StewartSperry are due back in court on Jan. 17. In an update about the case on Wednesday evening Carrique said Pierzchala was essentially ambushed when he attended the intersection of Indian Line and Concession 14 to respond to the call and stood absolutely no chance of being able to defend himself. Carrique said the two suspects also allegedly stole a vehicle to flee the scene. They later ditched that vehicle and fled the scene on foot but officers were able to track and arrest them nearby. The commissioner also paid tribute to Pierzchala and said he had been with the OPP for over a year and was highly regarded and respected by his colleagues. At the beginning of his shift on Tuesday Pierzchala received notice that he had successfully completed his 10month probationary period with the OPP. Prior to working for the OPP Pierzchala was a former Queens Park special constable. With files from CP24s Bryann Aguilar

Google Pixel January 2023 update breaks Bluetooth connectivity with cars,Google's most recent security update for its Pixel phones has broken the ability to pair the device with a user's car.,2023-01-06T19:38:05Z,https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-january-2023-patch-bluetooth-problems,Google Pixel January 2023 update breaks Bluetooth connectivity with cars No tunes on the way to work should be a crime. What you need to know January 2023 security patch causes problems for Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 series devices. The phones are having problems connecting via Bluetooth with their vehicles after the latest update. Users have not been able to connect with cars from Kia Hyundai Toyota Honda Infiniti Volvo Subaru Mazda and Ford. Two parts of Googles ecosystem are at odds with its most recent smartphone security update. The past few days have been filled with Reddit users creating threads to voice issues with the January 2023 security patch and Bluetooth connectivity in their cars via Android Police. With the latest update Pixel 7 and Pixel 6 series phones refuse to pair with Android Auto for music playback and other features while on the road. Its caused some frustration with one Reddit user stating theyve factory reset the system in their car reset network settings and even restarted their phone to no avail. It was also found that the users car would pair with other phones and their phone would pair with other vehicles as well. Other users in the thread commented that their phone would briefly connect before providing an error message and disconnecting. Users continue to chime into the conversation stating that the problem appears to affect Kia Hyundai Toyota Honda Infiniti Volvo and Subaru vehicles. While user reports primarily mention those vehicles with some mentioning Mazda and Ford too its not every single model from these car makers. Apparently some owners of a 2012 Hyundai and 2015 Kia are having no problems at all with the January 2023 security patch and their Pixel. Google started rolling out its January 2023 security patch to eligible Pixel phones three days ago. While the update is light the patch did bring some fixes to Bluetooth specifically. The company was looking at rectifying some problems with Bluetooth devices not receiving audio as well as some lowenergy devices being unable to pair with your phone. It looks like somewhere in these Bluetooth fixes is the current problem drivers have been facing for the past few days. Considering this is most likely an issue with the software another patch to address this will most likely be required. People have contacted Google Support about the issue but have received no response as of yet. If youve yet to update your Pixel 6 series device or Pixel 7 series phone with the January 2023 patch it may be best to avoid doing so until Google properly addresses it. Android Central has reached out to Google about the latest issue caused by the most recent security patch but has not received word back in time for publication.

Lego Technic's 1/12-scale Ford GT kit is surprisingly detailed originally appeared on Autoblog on Wed, 4 Jan 2023 11:09:…",2023-01-04T16:09:00Z,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/01/04/lego-ford-gt-1466-pieces/,Lego Technic has added the Ford GT to its catalog of 112scale cars. Designed for adult builders the scaleddown supercar features several lifelike features like a V6 engine with moving pistons an adjustable rear spoiler and even an independent suspension system. The kit consists of 1466 pieces that come together to make a GT thats over 15 inches long 7 inches wide and 3. 5 inches tall. This isnt the kind of Lego set you can build on your lunch break it will likely take several evenings worth of work to put together. The tradeoff is that the GT is stunningly realistic finished in blue with white stripes the coupe features relatively accurate proportions and moving parts. Like the real GT the Lego version is equipped with a V6 engine that spins the rear wheels via a differential a functioning steering system and doors that swing up rather than out. The rear spoiler is adjustable and Lego even recreated the air vents positioned behind the doors. The wheels are fairly generic however they feature the same design as the ones that come with Lego Technics Porsche 911 RSR kit. Retailers online and around the world will begin receiving Lego Technics Ford GT in March 2023 and suggested pricing is set at 120 excluding tax. If the Ford GT isnt your cup of tea the Danish company has plenty of other cars in the pipeline for 2023. It teamed up with Bugatti to make a 905piece Bolide kit and it will add five cars including the McLaren F1 LM to its Speed Champions collection.

Second-generation Ford F-150 Lightning due in 2025 originally appeared on Autoblog on Tue, 3 Jan 2023 10:38:00 EST. Ple…",2023-01-03T15:38:00Z,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/01/03/next-ford-f150-lightning-and-other-ford-electric-trucks/,AutoForecast Solutions says the nextgeneration Ford F150 Lightning has a production start date of August 18 2025. After that AFS predicts four months of production overlap between it and the current F150 Lightning which is expected to remain in production until December 24 of that year. These are two more speculative pieces in the hazy puzzle of Fords electric truck strategy over the next few years. Based on news reports as well as comments from Ford CEO Jim Farley since the first F150 Lightning launch we know theres a lot coming but its not clear how much will be exclusive to the Lightning line or will be folded into a new pickup. The coming electric fullsizer will ride on the new TE1 platform that might also be headed for the Expedition and Lincoln Navigator the dedicated EV platform shedding platform ties to the traditional ICE F150 while getting better batteries and more range. The BlueOval City production complex in Tennessee will also build another EV pickup one Farley told Automotive News will be a vehicle we do not have today on a brandnew platform a fullsize pickup platform. We think its going to be incredibly high volume. Thats a pickup Ford has also described as a nextgen electric truck different from the F150 Lightning. Laycee at the Miss GoElectric YouTube channel said she spoke to Farley at the Lighting launch earlier this year and was told the pickup would have a radical and perhaps controversial design active aerodynamics and be able to offer around 100 miles more range than the F150 Lightning. Whatever this rig is Lacey said Fords been working on it for roughly 2 years. Reports say theres an electric Ranger and an electric Bronco on the way. Between those and whatever else Fords cooking up its hard to tell where the Lightning ends and new products begin. And what kind of vehicle does Ford not have today that sits on a fullsize platform can be generously described as a truck and is incredibly high volume The electric Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator are due in 2025 if those can be called trucks. In the meantime the current Lightning and the Mustang MachE are still waiting to move to Sync 4A infotainment before a delayed switch to Android Automotive. The overhauled Sync is said to bring customerrequested features like a refreshed interface larger icons and new HVAC control using the audio knob. On the ICE side Ford Authority reports the next gas and dieselpowered F150 will debut next year for the 2024 model year.

Ford recalls small batch of Broncos for unsecured airbag sensors originally appeared on Autoblog on Fri, 30 Dec 2022 10:30:00 E…",2022-12-30T15:30:00Z,https://www.autoblog.com/2022/12/30/ford-bronco-airbag-sensor-recall/,Ford is recalling a relatively small number of Bronco SUVs not to be confused with the Bronco Sport to address the possibility that their sideimpact sensors werent properly secured at the factory and managed to slip through the companys quality control procedures without being addressed. Per Ford just 1226 of the trucks produced for the 2021 and 2022 model years may exhibit the issue and its a relatively minor one provided you dont get Tboned of course. Affected vehicles may have a righthand andor lefthand side impact sensor that is not properly secured to the vehicle Fords defect report said. An unsecured side impact sensor may not properly detect certain side impact events. Incorrect side impact sensor readings could cause the affected air bags to unintentionally deploy or to not deploy when intended increasing the risk of injury in a crash. Strangely Ford says its quality control system actually identified and isolated the problem before the trucks ever left the plant but along the line somebody dropped the ball and the proper procedures were not followed to rectify the issue. Plant personnel identified certain vehicles that required secondary checks for an improper side impact sensor mounting installation. Although the improper side impact sensor mounting installation was detected by the vehicle assembly plant errorproofing process inspection and repair instructions may have been misunderstood and the side impact sensor mounting assembly may not have been inspected or repaired Fords report said.

2022 Ford F-150 Lightning Lariat Drivers' Notes: The shine isn't wearing off originally appeared …",2022-12-27T11:00:00Z,https://www.autoblog.com/2022/12/27/2022-ford-f150-lightning-drivers-notes/,TrimLariat EngineDualMotor Power580 HP 775 LBFT TransmissionSingle speed DrivetrainAWD Towing10000 LBS Seating2 3 MPG70 MPGe Base Price76369 As Tested Price89314 The 2022 Ford F150 Lightning continues to impress with each successive time we get behind the wheel. Its an electric F150 without any major barriers or quirks to turn off the average truck buyer. Judging by the ravenous demand Ford appears to have gotten this formula right. Thats no surprise though as very few brands know truck buyers better than the king of fullsize truck sales Ford. Here we have a Lariat model with the extendedrange battery pack. Based on pricing the level of equipment and the range provided by the big battery pack 320 miles its likely going to be a popular grade to buy. The AWD Lightning with this extended range pack produces a walloping 580 horsepower and 775 poundfeet of torque and with our testers Max Trailer Tow package can tow up to 10000 pounds. Payload capacity sits at a slightly less impressive 1800 pounds but you do get the Technology of the Year awardwinning Onboard Scales and Smart Hitch tech to make towing and hauling easier. Pricing for the Lightning has changed between when we tested it and when this review was published to give you an idea of how often Ford has increased the Lightnings prices this year. When we had the truck it stickered for 80739 but today a similarlyequipped 2023 F150 Lightning will run you 89314. Even for an already expensive truck thats a big uptick. Even so theres so much to love about this electric truck that looking beyond that price increase is possible. The F150 Lightning is truly one of the best trucks you can buy today electric or not. Consumer Editor Jeremy Korzeniewski The Ford Lightning seems designed specifically not to wow onlookers. Besides the bluntnosed face with its grilleless opening you pretty much have to look underneath to see that this isnt a runofthemill FSeries truck. Next to the Hummer EV I drove on the same day the Lightning just didnt stand out. If that sounds like a demerit its not meant to be. Not only is the appearance like that of a standard Ford truck so too is the experience from behind the wheel. Except that its really really powerful. Ive put thousands of miles on dozens of Ford F150 models and the Lightning is easily the most fun to drive Im excluding the Raptor for obvious reasons. Theres power whenever and wherever you want it. Considering its mass and the fact that its a pickup truck and not a sport sedan it even rides and steers pretty darn well. Its honestly hard to believe that this is Fords very first electric pickup truck. Its refined drives well has a lot of range though towing a large load will cut that in half and well packaged. If only they werent so hard to find for sale without ridiculous dealership markups... Associate Editor Byron Hurd The Lightning is the most conventional EV Ive ever driven. It just feels like a truck albeit a quiet one. Fittingly we invited the Lightning to be evaluated for Tech of the Year because its towhaul tech just plain works consistently and serves a practical purpose for people who actually use their trucks for truck stuff. Its simple smart and useful and doesnt feel like a gimmick much like the Lightning itself. Maybe this truck is too sensible for the typical EV consumer but Im betting thats why it will appeal to more than a few typical truck people. News Editor Joel Stocksdale Man trailering technology just keeps getting better and better. Im amazed at how clear and responsive the Onboard Scale and Smart Hitch systems are. Theyre supereasy to understand and theyre not hard to dig up in the infotainment system. Having that guide for loading a trailer correctly is also really helpful and important for safe use of a trailer. Its great that there are all these tools for making trailering easier and safer for even amateurs who really will need the help the most. It sure would be nice if more of these tools were just standard though. Road Test Editor Zac Palmer The F150 Lightning is easily my new favorite fullsize pickup. Its the most comfortable smoothest quietest and effortless F150 money can buy. Now the amount of money necessary to purchase an F150 Lightning keeps going up but that doesnt mean you should turn away quite yet. Even with the price increases the Lightning is a stellar EV. I think Ford nailed what people want in an electric truck from virtually every perspective. If you want to drive it around like a normal vehicle that can be done. Prefer a onepedal experience like many EV fans do That can also be done. Acceleration off the line is potent and the first time you go full throttle youll understand why President Biden was raving about the prototype he drove a couple years ago. Typical truck buyers should enjoy the trucklike handling and feel of the F150. This is no sports car masquerading as a pickup. Itll roll and move like a regular truck will but the inherent low center of gravity still makes for a more stablefeeling truck than any gasolinepowered F150. The interior tech encompassing the massive infotainment system and digital instrument cluster work well. However I do wish it had a few more physical controls like gaspowered F150s do. The central screen can be a touch laggy on initial startup leading to delays to inputs dont make anybody wait an extra few seconds to get those heated seats rolling on a cold morning Last on the list of complaints is the charging technology itself. Ford promises 155 kW of fast charging capability and while respectable thats still not superquick when youre dealing with such a large battery pack. If youre towing long enough to require charging stops it could make for an excessively long road trip which is never fun. That said Im convinced the Lightning could replace a massive amount of gaspowered F150s on the road right now and everybodys truck lives would be significantly better for it. This thing rules.

Dodge Challenger outsells Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro originally appeared on Autoblog on Mon, 9 Jan 2023 10:38…",2023-01-09T15:38:00Z,https://www.autoblog.com/2023/01/09/dodge-challenger-outsells-ford-mustang-chevy-camaro/,Released for 2008 the currentgeneration Dodge Challenger remains Americas favorite muscle car in spite of its age. Sales increased by 1 in 2022 and the big coupe ended the year ahead of the Ford Mustang while outselling the Chevrolet Camaro by significant margin. Dodge sold 55060 units of the Challenger in 2022 up from 54314 in 2021. To add context the companys annual sales totaled 190795 cars in 2022 including 80074 examples of the Charger its bestselling model and merely 55433 units of the Durango a 16 drop from 2021. For those keeping track of zombie cars Dodge also sold 194 units of the Journey four examples of the Dart and a single Viper. While the original Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro were designed as pony cars the currentgeneration models are generally lumped into the muscle car category and marketed as the Challengers direct rivals. Sticking to this logic the Challenger easily outsold its rivals 47566 of the Mustang found a home in 2022 down from 52414 in 2021 and Chevrolet sold 24652 examples of the Camaro up from 21893 in 2021. Both models are offered as a coupe and as a convertible the Challenger is coupeonly at least from the factory. The Challengers success defies most conventional business models The average car doesnt live to see its 15th birthday let alone celebrate it by outselling its main rivals. It also performed better than numerous mainstream models including the Jeep Cherokee 40322 units the Jeep Renegade 27549 units the Chevrolet Bolt and Bolt EUV 38120 units combined and the Nissan Leaf 12025 units. Age isnt the only impressive factor here The Challenger competes in a shrinking segment of the industry that many of Dodges rivals have given up on. In spite of its success the Challenger has nearly reached the end of its life. Dodge confirmed it will can the model before the end of 2023 and most sources agree that a direct replacement isnt in the pipeline. Instead its spot in the range will be filled by the production version of the electric Charger Daytona SRT concept unveiled in 2022. EVs remain a niche in our market and the new coupe will inevitably cost more than the model it replaces due to its drivetrain so it will be interesting to see if Dodge can continue beating Ford and Chevrolet especially as production of the new Mustang ramps up. As for the Camaro it sounds like the heritagelaced nameplate will morph into a subbrand. Related video
