Yasuhide Mizuno said the costs of building a highvalue electric vehicle such as the newly unveiled Afeela would be significant and a stock offering has been discussed as one potential avenue for raising funds. IPO is one of our options Mizuno told a group of journalists Thursday in a roundtable discussion. We have to be able to stand on our own two feet. Honda Chief Executive Toshihiro Mibe said in March that while he was not thinking about taking the joint venture public immediately he would not dismiss that as an option to expand the firm. Sony unveiled the lowslung sedan prototype on Wednesday at a news conference in which it announced the Afeela brand name intended to evoke an emotional connection with customers. Mizuno said the car is scheduled to be delivered in the United States starting in early spring 2026 then in Japan later that year. Sony Honda Mobility plans a global rollout that includes Europe parts of Asia and the Middle East he added.

Between the Steam Deck Playdate and an explosion of retro consoles we received an embarrassing amount of mobile gaming goodness in 2022 and cloud play is only encouraging more innovation. Even though Sony still hasnt revived the Vita it feels like the handheld market is in the throes of a renaissance so lets celebrate the milestones of the year right here. December is a historic month for handheld gaming. Sony released the PlayStation Portable in Japan on December 12th 2004 and then debuted the Vita in Japan on December 17th 2011. Both of these consoles were hits with players critics and developers but a disorganized marketing scheme and failed cloud ambitions kept Sony from investing in handheld gaming after the Vita. RIP etc. Basically for the past decade weve been waiting very patiently mind you for a breakthrough mobile device to finally make this industry viable again. Finally in 2022 the handheld market is flush. The Switch paved the way for mobile play over the past few years and massive corporations like Valve are finally getting in on the action. Cloud gaming has found its foothold and the market for portable Android and Linux devices is buzzing with major names like Razer getting involved. Meanwhile more underground companies like Analogue Ayaneo and Panic are quietly churning out highquality handhelds for retro PC and indie gaming. But of course Valves Steam Deck dominated the portable conversation in 2022. The Steam Deck is big its heavy it doesnt have a great battery life and its everything PC players have been waiting for apparently. Valve started rolling out the Steam Deck in February and by October it had shipped more than 1 million of these beasts across the western world with plans to expand into additional regions. Steam Deck comes in three flavors ranging from 400 to 650 which makes it more affordable than existing handheld PC devices from companies like Ayaneo. It comes with Steam preinstalled but itll also run Windows if you really want to spend an afternoon screaming why at the machine in your lap. Imperfect though it may be Steam Deck proved theres heat in the handheld PC market in 2022. Its a relatively accessible way to play PC games on a portable screen and it successfully combines the Steam software with decades of hardware research at Valve. The Steam Deck is a great start from a company thats known to lose focus easily so hopefully it doesnt all end here. Even if Valve gets too distracted to make a Steam Deck 2. 0 plenty of other companies are eager to pick up the thread in the mobile PC space. The most prominent name is Ayaneo a brand that took off in 2021 thanks to an Indiegogo campaign that raised more than 2 million. Today Ayaneo is continuing to iterate on its original PC device with sleek Switchsized machines capable of running titles from Steam the Epic Games Store Game Pass and other hubs. The Ayaneo Air Pro starts at 700 and can technically handle highfidelity games though youll likely have to lower your framerate resolution and expectations. The beefiest Ayaneo the Next Pro starts at 1500 and itll run anything a Steam Deck can but without the extra bulk. Ayaneo makes extremely cute gadgets and the company is emerging as Valves main competitor for portable PC glory. The Ayaneo 2 is poised to pack even more power into a sleek package though itll have a price tag of 1000 at least. The exciting thing here is that theres actual competition in the handheld space companies are investing in mobile hardware more than ever and not just when it comes to PC play. Recent upgrades in mobile processors are powering a ton of new devices built specifically for retro and cloud gaming. At the end of 2022 the market for retro handhelds is lush covering every era from NES to GameCube at relatively affordable prices. On the NES to PSP side of things this year we got the Miyoo Mini and Retroid Pocket 3 The Miyoo Mini costs about 60 and has a modern dualcore processor that can handle even some PS1 games while the Pocket 3 is an Androidpowered handheld that costs 120. For more modern emulation experiences theres the Odin by Ayn which can run PS2 and GameCube titles at 1080p on a 5. 9inch screen. The Odin costs between 200 and 290 depending on the model. For retro handhelds the general rule is the hardware gets more expensive as the era progresses. In the honorable mention section we have the Analogue Pocket which plays actual physical cartridges from the Game Boy Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance and is unsurprisingly about the size of a classic Game Boy. Analogue started shipping the Pocket at the end of 2021 and it enjoyed a soldout year with more orders and accessories due in 2023. Pocket is a special little handheld that breathes new life into classic cartridge libraries and it comes with a price tag of 220 which is just about what a Game Boy would cost in todays coin. OK thats enough about the past. If 2022 has proven anything its that portable gaming has a strong future and this is going to include cloud and phone play. Cloud technology has finally become reliable enough that even Sony figured it out this year and Microsoft has continued to grow its enormous cloud network which is intrinsically tied to Game Pass. Our slowly encroaching subscriptionbased future has created a rich environment for Android and Linuxbased handhelds that dont need a ton of onboard processing power as the Steam Deck does. Logitech recently dropped the G Cloud Gaming Handheld which costs 350 while the Razer Edge is an Androidbased handheld starting at 400 and expected to start shipping in January. This year Razer also released the Kishi V2 which is a 100 gamepad that essentially turns your smartphone into a cloud gaming device. Backbone makes a similar product for iPhone and Android players and this year the company rolled out an officially licensed PlayStation gamepad just for iPhone. As mobile processors continue to evolve and cloud technology further stabilizes smartphone gaming is only going to grow as an industry and already mainstream entertainment companies like Netflix are joining the fray. Netflix specifically has ushered acclaimed games like Kentucky Route Zero Into the Breach and Spiritfarer onto mobile devices this year and its introduced gems like Poinpy and Hello Kitty Happiness Parade. Finally Id like to take a moment to honor Playdate. This brilliant businesscardsized indie gaming machine came out in April it costs 180 it has a crank and it doesnt fit into any existing video game category. Playdate exemplifies innovation. Its an opensource crankpowered piece of magic offering some of the most unique experiences the video game industry has to offer distilled on a miniscule monochromatic screen. Playdate is pure joy in a tiny yellow package and for me its the standout handheld of 2022. And thats a wrap. Heres to you handheld gaming. Thank you for a fantastic year and may the momentum of 2022 continue to generate creative ideas in this space. To the years and games ahead cheers.

The first Gran Turismo teaser shows off sleek cars and angles ripped straight out of the game franchise all from the lens of District 9 director Neill Blomkamp. Blomkamp helped introduce the short video during Sonys CES 2023 show where executives played up their plans to adapt even more game franchises to film and television. Gran Turismo is due to hit theaters on August 11th. The film is based on a true story apparently it follows a teenage Gran Turismo player who uses his sweet gaming skills to become a realworld racecar driver. The teenager is played by Archie Madekwe Simon from Midsommar and the movie also stars David Harbour Stranger Things Orlando Bloom the early 2000s and Geri Halliwell Ginger Spice. The Gran Turismo movie has spent some time in development hell much like the video game series itself which has a reputation for being delayed. A version of the film was completely scrapped in 2018 after spending five years in development and Blomkamp is the second director to be attached to a Gran Turismo project. However things have moved quickly since development on the current movie started in May 2022 with filming wrapped by that December. Gran Turismo isnt the only gamefilm crossover project in the works at Sony. Theres a whole HBO series based on The Last of Us premiering January 15th a Twisted Metal show heading to Peacock and a film based on Ghost of Tsushima still to come.

The new RS 3 Mini weighs in at just 1. 8 pounds but can carry cameras up to 4. 4 pounds which includes heavy mirrorless models like Canons EOS R3 and even some cinema cameras. At the same time it offers DJIs latest stabilization algorithms easy controls and more. DJI has tested the RS 3 Mini with cameras like the Sony A7S III with a 2470mm f2. 8 GM lens the Canon EOS R5 with an RF2470mm f2. 8 STM lens or a Fuji XH2S and XF 1855mm f2. 84. 0 lens. I tried it with a Panasonic GH6 and 1260mm f2. 84 and a Canon EOS R6 Mark II with a 24104mm f4 and had no problems. A powerful motor ensures that even when the zoom reaches the maximum focal length the footage captured remains stable and there is no need to repeat balancing DJI says. Gallery DJI RS 3 Mini camera gimbal 15 Photos Its relatively easy to mount cameras thanks to the newly designed dual layer quickrelease plate. That also allows for vertical shooting if you attach the plate to vertical arm and there are no rotation angle limitations in that mode. As with the RS3 the sliding quick release plates make it easy to balance in just a few minutes. It supports both wired and wireless Bluetooth shutterrecord activation via the RS3 Minis record button with the camera ready to go as soon as its turned on. For Sony cameras with supported power zoom lenses you can also control the zoom using the front dial without the need for a camera control cable. It offers the usual other DJI Ronin control dials including a joystick M button to switch modes a trigger a front dial and the aforementioned record button. You can also add Ronin accessories like the Briefcase handle fill lights or microphones. Functions are controlled by the 1. 4inch fullcolor touchscreen letting you change shooting modes balance the gimbal motors and more. You can also do much of that with the app or set functions like Timelapse Track recording move along up to 10 preset points and Panorama. Finally it can go up to 10 hours on a charge with the integrated battery handle and can be fully charged in as little as 2. 5 hours with a 10W charger. I had a chance to briefly try out DJIs RS 3 Mini and my early impressions were good. Im not much of a gimbal guy as I often work alone and dont have the need for tracking shots very often. However this one is so light that I was able to use it a fair while without tiring out. Its also very convenient there was no need to rebalance even if I zoomed out or changed my cameras configuration. And I was able to shoot most of my footage onehanded as DJI promises. The results were great it produced very smooth footage both in the horizontal and vertical configurations. The RS 3 Mini is also a relative bargain compared to the 550 RS 3 Pro. Its available for purchase today at authorized retailers or DJIs Store for 369 339 GBP 389 EUR. If youre concerned about knocking it into a wall DJIs Care Refresh insurance is now available for the RS 3 Mini as well.

The greatest part about the new PlayStation controller is its designed from the ground up to be not standard AbleGamers Senior Director of Development Steve Spohn said in a promotional video alongside the announcement. Still the promise of an official PS5 accessibility controller in the future should be welcome news to many players. Krissie A. who cant use a DualSense for extended periods without excessive hand pain told Ars last year Ive played on Sony consoles since the original PlayStation and to be excluded from a console due to my disability is a bit of a kick in the teeth and to be honest quite unacceptable in 2022.

Sony SONYN gave a glimpse of the Afeela which sports rounded corners and a sleek black roof at the CES 2023 technology trade show in Las Vegas. The car will use technology from hardware maker Qualcomm Inc QCOMQ including its Snapdragon digital chassis. Sonys longawaited push into electric vehicles it announced the venture with Honda HMCN in March shows how manufacturers are increasingly focused on the cockpit experience in cars which offers the potential to sell content via subscription services cars especially as autonomous driving capabilities improve. In order to realize intelligent mobility continuous software updates and highperformance computing are required Yashuhide Mizuno the chief executive of Sony Honda Mobility told the trade show. To that end we will work closely with Qualcomm. Qualcomm on Wednesday launched a new processor the Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC that handles both assisted driving and cockpit functions including entertainment. Previously those functions were handled on different chips and bringing them together can help bring down costs a Qualcomm executive told Reuters. Sony is also looking to harness its traditional strengths in sensors. The Afeela will be equipped with more than 40 sensors Mizuno said. The car will use the Unreal Engine 3D creation tool from Epic Games the maker of the Fortnite series of games. For Honda the venture with Sony may allow it to speed up what has so far been a slow shift to electric. It has also struggled over the years to make gains in the luxury vehicle market with its Acura brand. The new EV will be priced at a premium the venture has said. The venture between Sony Group Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd aims to deliver its first electric vehicles by early 2026 in North America. Shares of Sony were up 1. 6 in Tokyo trade while Honda shares were flat. The benchmark Nikkei 225 was little changed.

Well CES is officially underway. The floor is open and hordes of PR reps journalists and eager entrepreneurs are coursing through the arteries of the Las Vegas Convention Center. Of course even before the LVCC opened its doors today theres been plenty of news coming out of CES 2023. Sony Sony held its big press conference Wednesday night covering everything from highend cinema cameras and nano satellites to video game movies and accessible controllers. The companys Project Leonardo controller will offer a variety of customizable buttons and other hardware in a kit built for those with limited motor ability. Like Microsofts Xbox Adaptive controller Project Leonardo reflects a growing trend in tech especially in the gaming industry to better serve those living with disabilities. The Sony announcement that made the biggest splash though might have been that the endlessly delayed Gran Turismo movie is coming out in 2023. Personally Im not a big fan of the Gran Turismo series or racing games in general but even I got a bit excited watching the trailer. The camera work in the upcoming Neill Blomkamp film is shaping up to be pretty intense. And in a weird bit of synergy Sony also unveiled a car of its own the newly christened Afeela concept which was born out of partnership with Honda. The first Sony Honda Mobility vehicle wont be ready for the road until 2026 at least. AMD AMD also made a splash two CPUs and a GPU. The beefiest of the bunch is definitely the new Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU which packs an insane 144MB of cache using the companys 3D VCache technology and reaches boost speeds of 5. 7GHz. The other two AMD announcements focused on the mobile side including the first RDNA 3 GPUs for laptops and a lineup of performancefocused Ryzen HX CPUs. Razer Another company focusing on raw power this CES was Razer which announced two new laptop models the Blade 16 and Blade 18. Theyre loaded to the brim with highend components like Intel Corei9 HX chips and NVIDIAs topoftheline RTX 4090 graphics cards. But personally I think the most interesting feature is the Blade 16s dual mode screen that can run either 4K at 120Hz and peak brightness of 1000 nits or full HD plus at 240Hz and 600 nits depending on whether speed or resolution are more important at that particular moment. Razer also finally gave us a release date for its Edge cloud gaming handheld which will land on January 26th. Lenovo The biggest dump of news though probably belongs to Lenovo. It announced two laptops a giant tablet an eink notepad and even a Think branded phone. The ThinkPhone finally brings some of Lenovos enterprise expertise to bear on Motorola mobile devices while the Smart Paper tablet syncs handwritten notes with audio recordings so you can scrub through a lecture and immediately see the notes associated with that moment. The most unique device though is the dual screen YogaBook 9i. Sure weve seen plenty of concept dualscreen machines before but the 9i isnt a pipe dream its an actual product that will go on sale later this year. Lenovo will even bundle all the accessories you need to make the most of its form factor including a foldable stand a stylus and a bluetooth keyboard. You can simply use the foldable as is and pull up a virtual keyboard on the bottom screen or you can attach the physical one to the screen and use the exposed bit of the display either as touchpad or to show widgets. But you could also set it up as basically a portable dualscreen workstation with the displays either side by side or stacked one over the other. Switching to the world of automobiles Google was finally ready to put its major overhaul of Android Auto on display and has started rolling it out to users. The new UI has a split screen mode and puts Maps in easier reach at all times. And speaking of Maps Google debuted a new HD version that will be coming to the Polestar 3. These higherresolution maps will be useful for Pilot Assist but might prove essential for future selfdriving features. Unfortunately no word on when or if the HD Maps will be coming to other vehicles. Stellantis Last but not least Stellantis revealed its Ram 1500 Revolution BEV Concept truck. In the grand tradition of truly outlandish concept vehicles showing up at CES the Revolution BEV has an augmented reality heads up display a collapsable steering wheel some sort of 3D animated avatar that the driver can interact with and will even follow you around like some sort of sad puppy dog if you want. On the more practical side it also sports four wheel steering and an 800 volt architecture that would allow it to get up to 100 miles of charge in just 10 minutes. Of course youll never actually be able to buy the Ram 1500 Revolution BEV Concept. But there is supposedly a Ram 1500 BEV coming in 2024 that will be loosely based on this. And dont worry theres still plenty more to come from CES Weve only just begun scouring the floor for hidden gems. So for all the details on anything you might have missed check out our comprehensive coverage on Engadget. com or our YouTube channel. And stay tuned more from CES 2023.

T teases Gran Turismo its longawaited adrenalinefueled film adaptation of Sony PlayStations hit carracing franchise at the CES 2023 technology trade show this week it will really be showing off its new identity as a contentdriven company. The movie reflects the transformation of the maker of the Walkman and Bravia TVs from a primarily hardwarefocused innovator to broadbased entertainment provider. It also represents a significant bridging of the divides between Sony Pictures Entertainment Sony PlayStation and Sony Music according to a dozen current and former senior executives interviewed by Reuters. I defined our identity as a creative entertainment company with a solid foundation on technology Sony chief executive Kenichiro Yoshida said. The films appearance at CES on a stage typically reserved for bigscreen TVs and robot pets caps 10 billion in investments in music games and anime over the last five years. Gran Turismo is one of 10 gameinspired film and television projects in various stages of development. HBOs The Last of Us about a man hired to smuggle a 14yearold girl across a pandemicplagued America debuts on Jan. 15. The New Yorker suggested the series could break the curse of bad videogame adaptations. Last month Amazon Prime Video ordered God of War a live action adaptation of the PlayStation hit based on Greek mythology. Sonys creative entertainment company approach extends beyond content. A SonyHonda electric vehicle scheduled to reach consumers by 2026 is being framed as a rolling showcase of Sonys entertainment gaming and camera sensor prowess. It will also generate recurring subscription revenue like other content services. Eventually we think in the long term the mobility space will become an entertainment space Yoshida said. The highprofile projects which could not have happened even three years ago grew out of regular conversations among Sony executives as they sought a way to work together more effectively. Sony resisted chasing after Netflix with a rival service and fended off an activist shareholders call to sell or spin off its media and entertainment assets in 2013. Instead it struck deals to provide movies to Netflix and Walt Disney Cos DIS. N Disney and series to HBO Amazon and Apple Incs AAPL. O Apple TV. The shift is reflected in Sonys results with twothirds of operating profit coming from games music and the film studio. Operating profit rose 8 to 344 billion yen 2. 6 billion for the JulySeptember quarter beating analyst estimates. In November with the music business offsetting weakness in the games group Sony hiked its fullyear operating profit forecast. This is a complete pivot of this company into something thats no longer an electronics company said Ulrike Schaede a professor of Japanese Business at UC San Diegos School of Global Policy and Strategy. Schaede said the company now has a coherent corporate narrative that would make it easier to unite the companys divisions. Thats the new Sony she said. Now can they deliver I dont know. TREASURE CHEST When veteran media executive Tony Vinciquerra was recruited as chairman of Sony Pictures in 2017 the division was reeling after a string of box office flops including the 2016 reboot of the Ghostbusters franchise. DVD and Bluray disc revenue had plummeted under pressure from streaming services and there were rumors of a possible sale media executives said. But Vinciquerra was attracted by the opportunity to leverage the companys assets Sony is the only company in the media business that has not only television or film but music PlayStation and technology he said in an interview. Sony had struggled for decades to achieve the synergy the company touted with its 1989 acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment. At best these forced collaborations ended up as product placement in a movie or marketing promotion. At worst they got in the way of adapting to the digital era. Entertainment executives then came up with PlayStation Productions a division within the games group located on the Culver City studio lot and dedicated to film and television adaptations. It acted as a cultural attach to Hollywood someone who could talk in their language PlayStation chief Jim Ryan said in an interview in a nonconfrontational nonadversarial way just you know just try to do the best thing for both divisions. The result was Uncharted last years release starring SpiderMans Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg in a hunt for Magellans lost treasure. The film delivered 401 million in global ticket sales and became the mostwatched film on Netflix when it was released on the streaming service in August. Meanwhile one of the most popular artists distributed by Sony Music the Puerto Rican rapper Benito Antonio Martnez Ocasio who performs as Bad Bunny will star in El Muerto a film drawn from Sonys Marvel Universe of characters due out in 2024. Bad Bunny is a Rimas Entertainment artist. Sony Music Entertainment CEO Rob Stringer said Yoshidas light touch has proven successful. Quite frankly the ideas are flying around and everyones much much more comfortable about talking to each other Stringer said. This August will bring another test of Sonys strategy when Gran Turismo hits theaters after languishing for 12 years. The movie is based on British racer Jann Mardenborough who won the 2011 GT Academy Europe at 19 and went on to a podium finish at the 24Hours of Le Mans in 2013.

Raspberry Pi's new 12-megapixel camera modules provide powered autofocus,"Raspberry Pi has launched the Camera Module 3 with big improvements, including higher resolution, infrared, HDR, autofocus, a wide angle FOV and more, the company announced.

Not counting the interchangeable lens model introduced in 2020 its the companys first new camera module in six years. The previous Module 2 cameras used a Sony IMX219 8megapixel sensor. However the new models carry Sonys new 12megapixel IMX708 chip which is not only larger but has more resolution. That translates to sharper images and also better lowlight sensitivity. It also has a 169 aspect ratio so HD video up to 1080p50 can be captured using the entire sensor area. Better still where the previous module had fixed autofocus Module 3 has builtin powered autofocus capability. That makes them a bit thicker up to 12. 4mm compared to 9mm but more versatile letting you focus on objects ranging in distance from 5cm 2 inches to infinity. The standard fieldofview FoV variants provide a 66 degree horizontal field of view roughly equivalent to a 28mm fullframe lens. The wide angle version however bumps that to 102 degrees horizontal a 14mm fullframe lens. With a more expensive and complex optical stack the wideangle version is a bit thicker 12. 4 compared to 11. 5mm according to Raspberry Pi. It also offers HDR capability taking multiple simultaneous exposures with different exposure times. That lets you capture interior shots for instance with the correct exposure on both interior and exterior details. And finally the NoIR no infrared filter sensors first introduced with the Module 2 can effectively convert your Raspberry Pi into a nightvision camera. The launch includes no less than four modules including standard and wide angle models both in visible light and NoIR infrared versions. Both the normal models start at 25 while the wide angle versions cost 35. Theyre now available at Raspberry Pis store.

After entering the modeling microphone space last year with the L22 the company is back with a pair of mics that while fairly pricey could appeal to serious bedroom producers. The Sphere DLX is the higherend model at 1499. It emulates 38 classic ribbon condenser and dynamic studio mics including models from Neumann Telefunken AKG Sony and others. Thats up from the 34 models that last years LP22 emulated. UA says the DLX can capture acoustic guitars and drum overheads in stereo with a single mic. In addition it can easily tame room coloration for cleaner more professional recordings using IsoSphere presets tailored for bedroom studios and popular isolation filters. The Sphere LX is a smaller and slightly cheaper model supporting 20 ribbon condenser and dynamic mic models. The 999 mic has dual goldsputtered diaphragms and what UA describes as the lowest noise of any mic in its class. UA says both models let you change the mic type polar pattern and other characteristics even after tracking with any interface in any DAW. Additionally they have Apollo interface presets designed to help users attain professionalsounding audio quickly with nearzero latency. Each device ships with a carrying case mic stand mount and cable 25 feet for the Sphere DLX and 10 feet for the LX. The DLX also includes a shock mount. Both mics are now shipping worldwide. Although the new models will likely be too expensive for many burgeoning creators the mics are still relatively affordable compared to the premium gear they emulate some could cost upwards of 5000. At the very least they provide more options for experienced podcasters streamers and musicians who want to upgrade their sound quality.

Sony and Honda Collab on New Electric Vehicle,The electronics giant and carmaker have revealed the name of their new car brand.,2023-01-06T04:41:00Z,https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/sony-and-honda-collab-on-new-afeela-electric-vehicle/442350,Sony and Honda Collab on New Electric Vehicle The electronics giant and carmaker have revealed the name of their new car brand. On January 4 at the 2023 Consumer Electronics Show CES in Vegas Sony and Honda revealed the product of a partnership they announced last year an electric vehicle dubbed Afeela. CES is the worlds largest technology trade show. Held annually its a big deal serving as a platform for companies to introduce their new technologies to the public. Sony Honda Mobility chief executive Yasuhide Mizuno unveiled the Afeela prototype in a presentation for the CES crowd inside the Mandalay Bay Convention Center. While there arent many details about the vehicle available it looks like Sony x Honda has eschewed the sleek look of eventual competitors like Lucid and Tesla for an accessible and familiar fourdoor sedanstyle design. Mizuno sketched a timeline of Afeelas availability stating that consumers can put in purchase orders by 2025 though U. S. customers might not expect delivery until 2026. Regarding the car itself he said At the heart of this mobility experience is the word feel. CNN has more about the presentation The car will have safety and driver assistance systems from Honda along with entertainment and interactive features from Sony Mizuno said. When developing the car the emphasis has been on software and user interface technology as much as on driving dynamics and performance he said. Running above the cars front bumper is a narrow exterior display screen the company calls the media bar. It will allow the vehicle to show information and interact with people outside the vehicle Mizuno said. Intriguingly for gamers Sony and Honda have incorporated graphics technology from Unreal Engine the company behind the uberpopular game Fortnite. Unsurprisingly perhaps Mizuno indicated there would be many entertainment choices inside the Afeela plus dozens of cameras and sensors for driver and passenger safety.

Sony and Honda Drive New Electric Car Afeela Onto the CES Stage - CNET,The Sony sensors on its Afeela-branded electric car can detect objects around the vehicle as well as detecting the driver's condition.,2023-01-05T22:59:00Z,https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/sony-and-honda-drive-new-electric-car-afeela-onto-the-ces-stage/,Sony and Honda have built a prototype of a new electric car. The vehicle which is branded Afeela and looks like a midsized sedan was driven on stage at CES 2023 on Wednesday. Afeela represents our concept of an interactive relationship where people feel the sensation of interactive mobility and where mobility can detect and understand people and society by utilizing sensing and AI technologies said Yasuhide Mizuno Sony Honda Mobility chief executive. The Afeela logo appears on a narrow screen or media bar on the vehicles front bumper. The bar can also interact and share information such as the weather or the cars state of charge with people outside the vehicle as demonstrated on stage. Mizuno didnt offer many details on why the name Afeela was selected but said the word feel is at the heart of the mobility experience. Leaning into Sonys strength in sensors the Afeela concept car comes equipped with 45 cameras and sensors on the interior and exterior of the vehicle some of which will be able to detect the drivers condition to help ensure safety the company said. The car will use technology from Qualcomm including its Snapdragon Digital Chassis while Unreal Engine graphics technology which was used in General Motors Hummer EV is slated to design interfaces for the vehicle. Thanks to Sonys side of the partnership the Afeela car is expected to have bestinclass entertainment for movies and games on tap as well. Also at CES BMWs i Vision Dee doubles as both a car and a friend. And VW unveiled a car clad in digital camouflage that changes color along with your music. For the design we are taking an approach that aims to set new value standards for mobility as we evolve automotive design to focus not only driving dynamics and performance but also on software networks and interfaces Mizuno said. Sony and Honda announced a joint venture at CES last year to develop and build electric cars. The JV called Sony Honda Mobility aims to have preorders established for its electric vehicle in the first half of 2025 with sales to follow in the latter half of that year. The first shipments are earmarked to be delivered to customers in North America in the spring of 2026 Mizuno said. The company appears to be focusing on online sales and Sony Honda Mobility has previously said it wants customers to take part in the product development process whatever that means. The car will be produced at Hondas facilities in North America.

The show wasnt as busy as in prepandemic years but many events were packed and companies had plenty of announcements to dig into. So what was the best of CES You can check out all the award winners right here. Our Best of the Best winner wasnt a car or a TV that sticks to the wall. No its Project Leonardo. This is Sonys first piece of gaming hardware designed specifically for people with limited motor control and its rather eyecatching. This controller kit works out of the box with the PlayStation 5 offering two circular gamepads lined with swappable buttons thirdparty accessory ports and other customizable inputs. The controllers sit flat on a table or mounted on a standard tripod. They can also pair with a DualSense to turn all three devices into a single gamepad offering plenty of flexibility. To make sure it delivered on its accessibility promises Sony partnered with advocacy organizations including AbleGamers SpecialEffect and Stack Up much like Microsoft did with the revolutionary Xbox Adaptive Controller.

According to Bloombergs Mark Gurman Apple plans to announce its first mixed reality headset this spring ahead of its annual WWDC conference in June. In a sign that a launch is finally on the horizon Apple has reportedly shared the headset with a handful of highprofile software developers giving them a first look at its new xrOS software. A focus on its newest hardware line will allegedly affect its heavy hitters however. The next version of the companys iOS operating system will likely ship with fewer major changes than originally planned due to Apple reassigning software engineers to the xrOS team. The same goes for macOS 14 Gurman adds. The company apparently has no updates of note for its iPad Apple Watch and audio product lines.

Sony’s electric car plans become clearer as it shows off prototype at CES,The new brand is called Afeela and goes on sale late 2025.,2023-01-05T14:44:16Z,https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/sonys-electric-car-plans-become-clearer-as-it-shows-off-prototype-at-ces/,One of the more intriguing stories to have emerged from the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas over the past few years has been Sonys electric vehicle. The Japanese tech giant stunned people in 2020 when it debuted the VisionS a handsome EV designed to showcase Sonys sensors and camera tech on the outside and its entertainment portfolio on the inside. The following year brought more developed prototypes of the VisionS into view then in 2022 it took an SUV version to CES as well. At that time Sony told the media it was exploring commercial possibilities for a Sony EV and last March it announced a strategic alliance with Honda with the latter providing vehicle body engineering and aftersales support and Sony providing the electronics sensors networking telecom and infotainment. For CES 2023 Sonys automotive ambitions have become a lot clearer. Sony Honda Mobility the joint venture is launching a brand called Afeela which it says is because feel is at the center of the mobility experience as people feel mobility as an intelligent entity and mobility feels people and society using sensing and network IT technologies. The car has changed a little since we saw it last year but the dominant design cues remain reminiscent of Porsche and LucidIm far from the only person to think it looks like a 911 Targa from the rear wheels back and theres a strong touch of the Lucid Air to the front of the new EV. Something to note on the exterior is a light bar at the front that the Afeela can use to express itself to surrounding people using light enabling interactive communication between mobility and people including displaying text messages like greetings or displaying the current weather. One wonders if theres an ability to display mirrorimage text to show messages to cars in front... The people inside the Afeela EV might not notice anything going on outside howeverSony wants the car to be a conduit for its entertainment offerings whether thats movies or music or gaming. To that end SHM has signed a deal with Epic Games to develop new entertainment. At Epic we are passionate about cars and the automotive industry and we couldnt be happier to see Sony and Sony Honda Mobility enter the innovative world of mobility and automotive technology. Together with them we look forward to bringing you exciting updates within this revolutionary space said Epic Chief Technical Officer Kim Libreri. Afeela isnt promising a fully autonomous futurenot yet at leastbut SHM says that it will develop a partially automated socalled level 3 driving system for highways as well as a socalled level 2 system for use in more builtup environments. The Afeela prototype packs 45 cameras and sensors inside and out to enable various advanced driver assistance systems. The entertainment and the ADAS features will require processing power and SHM has chosen Qualcomm as its partner in this area. The car is becoming increasingly connected and intelligent and how we experience our vehicles is changing. The Snapdragon Digital Chassis serves as the foundation for nextgeneration softwaredefined vehicles enabling new mobility experiences and services. We are excited to collaborate with Sony Honda Mobility to deliver on our shared vision for the car of the future said Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon. SHM says it will spend the next couple of years turning the Afeela prototype into a production car. It plans to start taking preorders in the first half of 2025 with production beginning in one of Hondas US factories. Cars will go to Japan and Europe first with North American deliveries planned for spring 2026.
Sony Claims The PlayStation 5 Shortage Is Over In 2023,"If you or a loved one has been struggling to find a PlayStation 5 since its launch in 2020, Sony says the box should be easier to find in your store of choice in 2023.Read more...",2023-01-05T15:50:00Z,https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-supply-stock-availability-where-to-find-1849953356,If you or a loved one has been struggling to find a PlayStation 5 since its launch in 2020 Sony says the box should be easier to find in your store of choice in 2023. Sony Interactive Entertainment President Jim Ryan said during the companys Consumer Electronics Presentation last night that everyone who wants a PS5 should have a much easier time finding one at retailers globally starting from this point forward. shoutout to The Verge You heard it here folks the shortage is over according to Sony at least. At the end of last year Kotaku looked into the status of PS5 and Xbox Series X availability and found the systems were at least marginally more available than they were after launch. So some tangible progress has been made since 2020. Back in December Sony said it had resolved supply issues in Asian territories but here in January it claims to have overcome this worldwide. Despite this the tech industry is dealing with semiconductor shortages that have made manufacturing devices like the PS5 much more difficult and some estimate this shortage will last well into 2023 and possibly 2024. So just how available the console will be in the coming months remains to be seen. As of this writing scalpers are still selling PlayStation 5 consoles at inflated prices on sites like eBay though theyre much closer to the systems shelf price of 499. If Sony can make good on its promise that the shortage is over hopefully the console is more widely available in 2023 and at its typical asking price. Regardless of the supply issues the PlayStation 5 has still managed to sell pretty well as Sony also announced at its CES conference that the console has surpassed 30 million units sold since its launch in 2020.

But Sony may also be planning to use the car as a way to advertise shit on the outside of it while you drive around. Welcome to the future. It sucks. The Afeela Sony and Hondas new smart EV electric vehicle is a joint venture between the two large companies designed to leverage both Sonys advanced tech and Hondas decades of car manufacturing. The result is a new superfancy and technologypacked prototype EV that Sony claims will be hitting the streets in a few years. And when it does apparently youll be able to use it to play PS5 games. Now to be clear you wont be able to just pop a PS5 disc into the car as Afeela will utilize cloud streaming to let owners and passengers play PS5 and PS4 games on the go provided you have a decent signal or internet connection. Youll also be able to watch movies and TV via the various screens inside the car. But the Afeela doesnt just have screens on the interior. No like a weird future episode of a Pimp My Ride reboot the Afeela also features an exterior widescreen display. Sony calls this the cars Media Bar and says it will let owners display a variety of data including the current weather and battery level of the car. It can also be used to display different colors or images too. Yasuhide Mizuno CEO of Sony Honda Mobility says with the media bar owners can express themselves by sharing various types of information to people around the car. Sony also has some less cool plans for this new media bar. During its CES showcase Sony briefly displayed an ad for SpiderMan No Way Home on the outside screen. Not much more was said about this brief moment from the event beyond Mizuno suggesting Sony was talking to partners about how they can create fun and exciting interactions using the media bar. That sounds a lot like Sony wants Afeelas to be mobile advertising billboards. Vertagear 800 Series Gaming Chair Ergonomic comfort Adjustable seat height neck support memory foam pillow adjustable back rest and tilt locking system and 4D armrests that move in 4 directions to fit you best. Of course all of this is still a few years away as Sony and Honda say the Afeela isnt coming out until 2026. But as a tease of what to expect from future smart cars its not looking good. Considering how adriddled smart TVs already are in 2023 Im not looking forward to cars getting covered in screens and ads too. I guess Ill barely notice as I play a laggy PS5 game via the cloud in the backseat of the Afeela. Anyway I thought the future would be cooler.
"Sony unveils Project Leonardo, a new controller for accessible gaming","Sony Playstation chief Jim Ryan said that the company will launch Project Leonardo, a new controller aimed at people with limited mobility.

Ryan …",2023-01-05T01:38:00Z,https://venturebeat.com/games/sony-unveils-project-leonardo-a-new-controller-for-accessible-gaming/,At CES Sony PlayStation chief Jim Ryan said that the company will launch Project Leonardo a new controller designed for gamers with limited mobility. The controller will make gaming more accessible for players who have challenges using ordinary controllers. Its quite reminiscent of Microsofts efforts with the Xbox Adaptive Controller. Ryan said more than 30 million PlayStation 5 consoles have been sold to date. Project Leonardo will allow more gamers to enjoy the console. Ryan said that Sony is working with experts on accessibility such as Able Gamers. You can read the details here. Leonardo is basically an accessibility kit designed to remove barriers to gaming and help players with disabilities play more easily more comfortably and for longer periods on PS5. Hideaki Nishino senior vice president for platform experience at SIE said in a blog post that accessibility is an important topic to us at PlayStation and the company wants to continue raising the bar to enable every gamer to experience the joy of play. Whether its the robust accessibility options in PlayStation Studios games like Santa Monica Studios God of War Ragnark or Naughty Dogs The Last of Us Part I or the wide array of features in our PS4 and PS5 console UI were passionate about reducing barriers to play for every gamer Nishino said. He added Today at CES we announced the next step in our journey to make gaming more accessible Project Leonardo for PlayStation 5. Developed with key contributions from accessibility experts community members and game developers Project Leonardo is our codename for a new highly customizable controller kit that works out of the box to help many players with disabilities play games more easily more comfortably and for longer periods. He said Sony talked to experts at AbleGamers SpecialEffect and Stack Up and then came up with the design for the highly configurable controller that works in tandem with many thirdparty accessibility accessories and integrates with the PS5 console to open up new ways of gaming. It is built to address common challenges faced by many players with limited motor control including difficulty holding a controller for long periods accurately pressing small clusters of buttons or triggers or positioning thumbs and fingers optimally on a standard controller Nishino said. The controller is highly customizable with a kit of swappable components including a variety of analog stick caps and buttons in different shapes and sizes. Players can use these components to craft a wide array of control layouts. And the distance of the analog stick from the game pad can be adjusted to suit the players preference. These components allow players to find a configuration that works for their strength range of motion and particular physical needs. You can remap the buttons as needed. Players can store their programmed button settings as control profiles and easily switch between them by pressing the profile button. For example players can augment their DualSense controller with a Project Leonardo controller or use two Project Leonardo controllers on their own. A friend or family member can also assist by helping to control the players game character with a DualSense controller or a second Project Leonardo controller. The controllers can be dynamically turned on or off and used in any combination. Project Leonardo is expandable through four 3. 5mm AUX ports to support a variety of external switches and thirdparty accessibility accessories. This enables users to integrate specialty switches buttons or analog sticks with the Project Leonardo controller. The external accessories can be dynamically connected or disconnected and each can be configured to act like any other button. Project Leonardos split symmetric design allows players to reposition the analog sticks as close together or as far apart as they like. The controller lies flat and does not need to be held so players can lay it on a tabletop or a wheelchair tray. It can be easily secured to AMPS mounts or tripods and can be oriented 360 degrees for the most comfortable use. Players can also program the north orientation on the analog sticks to match their preferred controller orientation. GamesBeats creed when covering the game industry is where passion meets business.

A button press or lowbattery notification makes the headphones scream at you ignoring the actual sound volume of what youre currently listening to. Once theyre discharged they suddenly emit loud noises lecture you about how the battery is low then shut down. Oh and you cant use them as theyre charging if your voicecall lasts longer than expected you might find yourself being shouted at and forced to fumble around with wires silently pleading for call participants to wait while you change over to a different headset. MisterHW decided to dig in and figure out how to work around at least some of the shortcomings. Naturally the no charge while using limit looked like lowhanging fruit and a hefty usability improvement too plus he suspected the charge cutoff to be masking noise issues already abundant on these headphones. Some painful disassembly later he was inspecting the charger IC the MP2625 responsible for power management. Its signals were connected to the MCU using viainpad and some pads had to be cut in half to disconnect the vias. However the laborious pad cutting and subsequent careful soldering didnt turn out to be fruitful. Even with external control of the output inhibition pins the shutoff still continued something affected the circuit whether it was VBUS detection some other unnoticed viaconnected pins on the charger or sensing on DD. About to run out of life force for this mod MisterHW added a Qi charging circuit powering a TP4056 wired in parallel with the MP2625. The mod dubbed HW1000XM3 made these headphones all that more reliable and less annoying charger and MCU none the wiser. Now all thats needed to charge these headphones is to slap a magnetic charger coil onto them and it doesnt interfere with voicecalls as much as the screaming and forced shutoffs do. Hopefully Sony eventually learns to test their headphones by having humans use them its far from the only gripes with this lineup after all. We also hope that the voice notifications will be conquered eventually this summer weve seen a hacker firmware mod a Bluetooth speaker to make the sounds more pleasant. If your headphones are based on a relatively popular module repurposing them might be even easier than that Introducing Son HW1000XM3 MagSafe Charger support low noise charging during conference calls the usual USBC charging that switches them off httpst. coeqc4xv6lk6 pic. twitter. comU92b7T3LJO Helge Wurst MisterHW December 12 2022
"Sony says its PlayStation 5 shortage is finally over, but it's still hard to buy","Over two years after the PlayStation 5 was released, Sony announced the shortage is finally over. Consumers should ""have a much easier time"" finding a console, an exec said.",2023-01-05T20:41:28Z,https://www.npr.org/2023/01/05/1147157065/sony-playstation-5-shortage-over,Sony says its PlayStation 5 shortage is finally over but its still hard to buy Sony announced that its PlayStation 5 shortage is essentially over. The companys gaming boss Jim Ryan said on Wednesday that Sony has now sold 30 million PS5s worldwide. He noted that December 2022 was the biggest month ever for the consoles sales. Everyone who wants a PS5 should have a much easier time finding one at retailers globally starting from this point forward said Ryan the President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment as part of Sonys 2023 Consumer Electronics Show. The console was released in November 2020 but was very difficult to obtain for most of its lifespan. A semiconductor chip shortage limited Sonys production of new PS5 consoles. Other supply chain issues prompted by the global coronavirus pandemic didnt help. Mostly obtaining a PS5 required getting very lucky in an onthespot release of new supply or being willing to pay significantly more than the consoles MSRP. It took until August 2022 to be deemed almost easy to buy. In Sonys press conference Ryan said supply improved steadily toward the end of 2022. Sony announced it passed 25 million units sold in November 2022 and presumably sold about five million more consoles in December 2022 alone. We truly appreciate the support and the patience of the PlayStation community as we managed unprecedented demand amid global challenges over the past two years Ryan said. However as of Thursday at noon PlayStation 5 consoles are still out of stock at BestBuy and most GameStop stores. Amazon lists the console as available by invitation and includes a disclaimer that the item is in highdemand and has limited quantities. The last wave of invitations went out on Dec. 30 2022.
The Chonky Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra Features the Largest Sensor Ever Put Into a Webcam,"Razer is promising “DSLR-level detail and clarity” from its new Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra by equipping it with the largest sensor ever used in a webcam.

But the company might be taking too much inspiration from DSLRs because this is also one of the largest and beefiest webcams weve ever seen perched atop a monitor. Despite its size the Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra is still a dedicated webcam and not a replacement for a DSLR by any stretch of the imagination. Crack it open and you wont find a fullframe 35millimeter sensor inside but a Sony 11. 2inch Starvis 2 sensor allowing the webcam to capture and stream 4K footage at 24 FPS 1440P at 30 FPS in HDR as well or 1080P at 60 FPS. The sensor is also paired with an F1. 7 aperture lens that should fair well in dark conditions given how much light its letting in while creating a true bokeh effect with a blurred background behind the subject. On the software side of things the Kiyo Pro Ultra uses AIpowered Face Tracking Autofocus to keep the subject in focus as they move around in frame as well as allowing for manual adjustments to ISO and shutter speed. For privacy the Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra also has a sixbladed aperture that can be manually closed with a twist to ensure the webcam cant see anything even if the computer its connected to over USB has been compromised. As for pricing The Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra is available for preorder starting today for 300. That pushes the price closer to a mirrorless digital camera which would potentially include an even larger sensor plus more lens options enabling more creative freedom but the appeal of the Kiyo Pro Ultra is that it offers a step up in terms of image quality but with the same ease of use of a dedicated webcam.
Poly’s Voyager Free 60+ might be the slickest earbuds for work yet,"There are so many wireless earbuds on the market it’s gotten hard for a new pair to stand out, especially when it comes to enterprise-focused options.

But Polys Voyager Free 60 buds may have just broken through thanks to a couple of innovative features. Like many of its rivals the Voyager Free 60 features a true wireless design and comes with a Qi charging case. The stems of each bud supports touch controls for adjusting playback while three mics and active noise cancellation help ensure both your voice and your audio sounds clear. However where things get interesting is when you check out the display built into the case which is only the second of its kind following the release of JBLs Tour PRO 2 buds back in August. By tapping and swiping on the display you can quickly do things like adjust volume toggle ANC check battery status switch between paired devices and more. This means you can leave your phone or laptop in your bag or pocket while you focus on your call. And with the Voyager Free 60 capable of remembering up to eight different devices with two being paired at the same time multidevice management is a cinch. However my favorite thing about the Voyager Free 60 is its broadcast mode. This allows you to use the included 3. 5mm to USBC cable to connect the case to an older device with a headphone jack like when youre on an airplane so you can watch movies during a flight without needing to carry a second set of headphones around. Sure its a bit of a niche situation but for frequent travelers its a great way to streamline your luggage. Additionally despite being made for the enterprise world the Voyager Free 60 sound great. Mids and highs are crisp and vibrant and while Id like a bit more thump in lower tones theres still more than an acceptable amount of bass. Poly says the firmware on the demo device I tried wasnt final so audio balance may be different on retail models. I also appreciate some of the smaller details like the inclusion of differentsized eartips and a bonus travel pouch that holds both the charging case and all of the earbuds included accessories. You even get the ability to choose between a USBA or USBC dongle for simple pairing with a phone or laptop. And because the earbuds support dualmode connectivity you can also connect to devices via Bluetooth. The biggest challenge for Polys Voyager Free 60 though is that priced at 350 it costs more than a lot of other highend earbuds including the AirPods Pro and the Sony WF1000XM4. Now I should mention that there will be a slightly less expensive nonplus version of the Voyager Free 60 buds that come with a more traditional case without a builtin screen but even these cheaper models will start at 299. 99. So despite some fancy features that could be very useful for business travelers unless you can sweet talk your companys IT department into upgrading your gadget kit they might be hard sell when they come out sometime in March.
