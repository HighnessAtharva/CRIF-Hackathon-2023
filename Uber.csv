Visa rules hindered him at every turn.,2023-01-05T10:00:00Z,https://www.businessinsider.com/immigrant-late-night-colbert-writer-2023-1,Im a writer for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. It was an incredibly difficult road to get here heres my advice for other immigrants who want to break into a creative industry. Felipe Torres Medina has been a writer at The Late Show with Stephen Colbert for three years. The immigration system was a hindrance as he was starting his TV writing career in America. This astoldto essay is based on a conversation with Felipe Torres Medina a writer for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. It has been edited for length and clarity. Ive been writing for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert for a little over three years now and I work with around to other writers. Being an immigrant comedy writer or comedian is so absurd. The whole process is Kafkaesque mountains and mountains of paperwork. Finding the joy in it was the only way for me to deal. Thats not to say I didnt get very sad sometimes but its informed my comedic voice and now Im adding that to my work on The Late Show. I recently got married to an American comedy writer and she writes for Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. We had a folder of paperwork that weighed around pounds that we took to our immigration interview. Thankfully they didnt ask for much but you have to have all these documents ready. I spent most of my life in Colombia before coming to the States As soon as I learned that writing for TV was a job I knew that was what I wanted to do. My family is artistically inclined but theyre not artists my parents are doctors. They were really supportive though. I moved to the States in when I was. Id gone to college in Colombia for literature before I moved to Boston I didnt even go to my college graduation. I really liked the sketch and latenight space so I applied to a grad program at Boston University to study screenwriting. I also took classes at the comedy theater Upright Citizens Brigade. Id take a a. m. bus from Boston get to New York at noon and go to a threehour UCB class at one. Then at p. m. Id leave New York to be back in Boston by midnight and then Id have class the next day. When I finished my program I moved to New York to try and break into comedy. I worked a lot of jobs in advertising and a few in publishing and I kept doing standup improv and sketch shows at the UCB. I also started getting published in some humor publications. People started to know who I was. I was invited to submit to several latenight shows and eventually I landed at The Late Show. Applying to be a latenight writer is a pretty secretive process Most latenight shows will invite you to submit a sample. Certain shows will ask you for a page of jokes others will ask for a full monologue. They might respond if they like you which can take forever. Shows are busy in general so they take a while to get back to you. Its understood and normal in the industry. Latenight comedy has really changed talking politics is the standard now. The Daily Show with Jon Stewart changed the idea of what late night was. That spun up The Colbert Report and then all the other latenight shows after that always had an opinion on politics. If you look at the recent latenight landscape Full Frontal with Samantha Bee John Oliver Seth Meyers Jimmy Fallon all had or have a political bent. As I was seeing these shows become more political I felt like I had a new perspective I could bring. Immigrant representation was severely lacking in late night when I first decided I wanted to be a writer and even though there are way more now were still few and far in between. You cant just move to the States to try and be a comedy writer I came to the States on a student visa and then after that I applied for an OB visa otherwise known as an artist visa thats how I was able to stay here and keep building my career. I was really stressed about getting a job right out of grad school because if youre on a student visa you can only get a job in your field you cant just move to LA or New York and get a barista job or drive for Uber while you pursue your dream. Legally youre not allowed to do that. I had days to find a job after graduation and months to work in my field. Since I studied screenwriting my visa requirements only allowed me to get jobs in writing media or content creation. If I couldnt find a job within days Id have to leave. I had a panic attack the first time I got something called a request for evidence the paperwork you have to submit to show youre fulfilling the requirements of your visa stay. They dont tell you outright what the problem is they just say This isnt enough. It was the first panic attack I ever had in my life. I was heartbroken every time a decision on my immigration got delayed. Ive missed so many birthdays graduations and special occasions with my family because I couldnt leave the country. Immigration also makes it hard for good news to just be good. You can get a job somewhere that you really want but then you think Well I have to wait and see if theyll issue me a new visa. I have pieces of advice for immigrant creatives in the States One very specific piece of advice is to get an artist visa. The way information about this visa is presented online makes it seem like its only for people who have won an Oscar Emmy or Nobel Prize but it just means youre an artist and youre very good at it. Its not an easy process by any means but it was certainly something I didnt know could be done by people who hadnt won the biggest awards in their field. The other thing I would say is to try everything creatively and put yourself out there for opportunities. I played any small role I could because that meant that I was getting stage time in one of the biggest improv theaters in the world. I was also collaborating with people who were more accomplished than I was who could maybe later write me a letter of recommendation for my visa process. More Americans should know more about how immigration works in the US For many groups not just immigrants being really good isnt enough. You can be excellent formidable even and still there can be a piece of paperwork you filed wrong. At each job I had in television production and journalism after school I ended up having to explain the immigration system to my bosses which is a really weird thing. People want to help if youre talented and a good employee but most times they truly just dont know how. Learning about the immigration system is so important. Im not saying Americans should be perfectly versed in it but they should know a little bit more because it affects the nation as a whole. Immigration is such a huge part of American politics. Everyone has an opinion on it but no one knows how it works. For me filling in that knowledge gap is so important. Thats the big thing I want to do with my comedy.

"9 tech predictions for 2023 from seed investor in Uber, Pinterest, and other top companies","Scott Belsky, Adobe's chief product officer, predicts that we will soon be able to see an AI created ""supercut of our lives"" among other advancements.",2023-01-03T09:30:00Z,https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-trends-for-2023-from-adobes-chief-product-officer-2022-12,tech predictions for from seed investor in Uber Pinterest and other top companies Scott Belsky is the founder of Behance and the chief product officer at Adobe. He predicts that our healthcare will be increasingly AIbased. Every year I ask myself How will work and life change in a material way over the next three to five years As a founder myself Behance Adobes Chief Product Officer and an early investor in over startups these trends inform my work and are a fun annual exercise. was a pivotal year for Collaborative web apps disrupting every function of the enterprise. Artificial intelligence reaching key milestones. Market shifts resetting companies and more. Now what are the forecasts and implications for the years ahead. Internet browsers will shift from generalized to specialized As web apps communal browsing and decentralized technology continue to grow browsers have become too generalized and antiquated for the future of web apps. This new age of web apps will increase collaboration help create more productive workflows and will tap into the power of the cloud for AI features and heavy computation. Web apps offer virality and infinite possibilities for productled growth and are finally powerful enough for sophisticated apps like Photoshop. But the full potential of these apps is constrained by the browser a general purpose and increasingly outdated piece of software. Thus a new generation of specialized browsers will emerge. Browsers will be reimagined for collaboration and higher performance web apps like Arc from The Browser Company. Some browsers like one being developed by Triangle Labs will specialize in decentralized applications with less friction and far more security and confidence. As the ultimate interface on top of the web browsers will begin to compete with the apps themselves. And the growing ecosystem of thirdparty plugins will compete directly with the next generation of these purposebuilt browsers.. Generative AI will have unexpected implications for content marketing education and the war to control the interface AI will commoditize decades of content marketing and SEO tactics and usher in a new era of brand and influencer marketing. Content marketing With models like ChatGPT driving the cost and time required to write effective SEO content down to zero every brand will flood the zone of search engines completely commoditizing content marketing. Education ChatGPT has done to writing what the calculator did to arithmetic. You can now ask AI to write an essay on dinosaurs in the style of a th grader or a th grader. After a few seconds youll get an entirely original output every time. Education curriculums should focus on things humans must do as opposed to things computers can now do for us. While most writing from content marketing to product specs will be assisted by AI going forward crafting presentations and oral rhetoric using counterintuitive arguments and creativity will be skills that bring a premium. Education curriculums must adjust accordingly. Math should be taught in Excel or Airtable and writing should be taught alongside the art of prompt engineering. The war for interface Leading knowledge and workflow management products will pivot to launch their own interface for queries. In just the last few months some of the internets greatest repositories of content like Quora Notion GitHub Stack Overflow and other legendary sources of usergenerated content have announced their own AIpowered chat experiences. This all leads to the uncomfortable realization that in the age of AI if you dont own the query interface youre just assembling training data for those who do. We know interface layers commoditize the technology underneath but I didnt realize interface layers would also commoditize content. Today AI is the ultimate interface layer as it not only disrupts underlying services data and content but also synthesizes and presents it all in transformative ways. AIpowered inproduct assistants will make a major comeback Microsofts infamous Clippy was just ahead of its time. QA interfaces on top of AI are the biggest threat to Google and other information sources that monetize via traffic.. A highly personalized AIpowered medical assistant will complement and eventually replace our General Practitioner If you ask ChatGPT about a medical condition you get a comprehensive often bulletpointed answer that rivals anything you could construct from dozens of Google searches. Now imagine if a more healthspecific AI model were personalized for you with a private database of every health result every trend from your Whoop band or Apple Watch your family health history and every ailment youve ever had. Conversing with such a deeply informed resource would be times better than our first line of defense today Google and could connect dots far better than we do on our own. I anticipate that the first line of healthcare will increasingly be AIbased and well start seeing this in the next months.. Social media will evolve to offer supercuts of our lives Much like Netflix well tune in to see the supercut of our lives presented as short and highly engaging AIedited daily or weekly episodes. The vanity metric and competitive component of this new era of social apps will simply be your contributions making the cut among all of the stuff you and your friends record throughout the day. The AI editorcurator will decide what everyone in your group will find interesting measured by previous allocations of attention to determine what content makes the final cut. One team exploring this space is Studio a group camcorder taking off amongst teenagers. More generally across the next generation of social apps the traditional social graph will continue to become less relevant as TikToklike AIpowered algorithmic feeds determine what we see based on what we like. However I am on the lookout for hybrid solutions that leverage both social graphs alongside AIpowered editing and curation.. New tools and AI capabilities will make us all more expressive and creatively confident We are more creatively confident in kindergarten than we are as adults. Our confidence deteriorates as we become discouraged by comparing ourselves to others and the difficulty of learning how to use creative tools. But now free webbased tools with templates have helped us conquer the fear of the blank screen. Plus powerful generative artificial intelligence enables anyone to express themselves creatively without a notoriously steep learning curve. As a result the value of creative work will shift from outcomes to process and ingenuity. The original idea the judgment the innovations in process and the story become more important than ever. Compensation models will shift from timebased to valuebased. Do creative people get paid for their judgment and ideas or their time Historically time has been the easiest measure of work and the most popular factor for charging for work completed. But in an era in which much of our mundane and repetitive work is accomplished by AIpowered assistants the time required for creative work has materially reduced. So how do creators start charging for value added as opposed to time spent Perhaps there will be some mutually agreed upon pricing model that takes experience into account Perhaps more creative teams will get compensated based on the performance of their work One of the most exciting and underdiscussed opportunities is new compensation models for creators to monetize the use of their style or likeness to generate original art or music. Compensation is ripe for reimagination in the era of AI.. Content creators will own their audience and some will become platformless Content creators with mass audiences are seeking novel ways to own the relationship. Remarkable minds like Sahil Bloom who shares curiosity and lessons learned in viral social threads or Becky Kennedy who alongside my wife Erica created Good Inside as an indispensable resource for parenting with over. million followers on Instagram are increasingly unwilling to rely on a single platform. I have watched Sahil build a fastgrowing Substack that has become a business in itself. And the Good Inside founders have launched a subscriptionbased community that is off to a wildly successful start. In both cases these subscriptions go way beyond lead generation they are alternatives or complements to books and social profiles. As social platforms get insecure about losing their creators content they will respond in ways that spawn the era of platformless creators. Weve seen Twitters shortlived policy outlawing links to competing platforms but they will surely continue to down rank tweets with outbound links. These behaviors to keep people onsite are antiCreator. My friend Li Jin wrote a great playbook for this new world in which creators can leverage new tech to own their audiences. Ultimately I believe all creatorsturnedbusinesses will own their audiences through newsletters and personalized subscriptionbased communities. Flawed censorship and moderation policies will cause operators of social platforms to act more as stewards than owners. Social platforms have been struggling more lately with the lines of censorship policy and active policing of content. The problem here is that the management teams of these social platforms are acting as owners decide right and wrong vs. stewards we are here to serve the community we will engage you in decisions seek not to pass judgment and strive for transparency whenever possible. One lesson learned building Behance to a community of miilion highly opinionated creative people you dont own a network you are the steward of a network.. We wont be able to trust our senses thanks to AI advancements Some of you may have seen this uncanny deep fake of Morgan Freeman circling the internet. Clearly we can no longer rely on our senses to determine truth. If youve been playing with any of the latest AIpowered video and editing features youve likely realized were entering an age where we can no longer believe our eyes. The same tools that speed up workflows and empower creative professionals to create wondrous media are becoming easier to use and more powerful. Were just years away from anyone being able to render a conversation with the unmistakable voice and likeness of somebody else without their permission. Our human senses and judgment will be hackable by anyone. Verify then trust is the new trust but verify. Its an era of both wondrous creativity and new genres of risk. We must be imaginative not just about what can go right but also about what can go wrong. Humans must develop new instincts to verify before we trust and become less prone to manipulation. We must usher in an era of attribution where content shows WHO made it and HOW it was made and unsigned content is assumed to be fake or AImade. When humans see anonymous content without any verifiable content credentials about its origins from open source efforts like the Content Authenticity Initiative we must stop believing it by default. At Adobe we are full steam ahead embracing this open source solution to enable creators to add content credentials but we need more engagement from both the content creation and social platforms of the world.. Hyperpersonalized experiences will enable an immersive era that is tailored to you. As people gain creative confidence culture will change as fashion and life design your furniture wallpaper etc. becomes hyperpersonalized. Today the designs in your life are created by small teams and generalized for the masses. The clothes you wear the media you consume the digital dashboard in your car the items in your home they are all made by a few and generalized for as many as possible. But with widespread creative confidence will come a desire to culturally flex yourself through personalization. I anticipate a world in which you customize your shoes or clothing before checking out. I anticipate that our experiences in cars will be personalized by us using templates for the dashboard design and customization kits for interiors. And when we start wearing AR glasses around every persons world will look remarkably different by design just because we can And new technology will emerge that enables user personalization without compromising user privacy. Yes sounds like a total contradiction but I am aware of one earlystage team assembling around this opportunity without creative solutions the great opt out of data.. Companies will perform rapid resets to focus economize and build resiliency Current market conditions shift companies from the carbs era to the muscle era of building great organizations. Coming off a decade of excess in which the easiest way to acquire customers and scale organizations was to throw more money and people at the problem the world is left with countless bloated organizations redundant teams and extraneous processes. But todays economic woes are a muchneeded forcing function. Were entering the muscle era where we must solve problems by changing how we work and building a more resilient and capable team. Resourcefulness outperforms resources. We can look at Twitter as a casestudy for rapid resets. What happens when you remove multiple levels of managers and bring everyone doing the work closer together Do you regain the agility of startups Do you instantly shed years of organizational debt that restrains a products potential I suspect well see more bold resets of companies around the world reimagined for a world in which most functions can be automated.

"The Age of Digital, Transparent Warfare Is Here","Precision weapons, satellites, and AI have changed how we fight—and who sees the consequences.",2023-01-06T12:00:00Z,https://www.wired.com/story/digital-warfare/,The war in Ukraine was a shock not a surpriseit was a clear and present danger ever since the Russian invasion of Crimea in. It was also not a surprise because the world watched Russia assemble its forces on Ukraines border for months. In war will be comprehensively transparent seen and understood by integrating information from satellitescommercial lowEarthorbit cubesats and highend geostationary military satellites and aircraft all the digital traces left as people and equipment move through a highly connected world from closedcircuit TV cameras and traffic data to bank cards and mobile phone locations and the proliferation of usergenerated content discoverable on social media. In it will no longer be possible to sneak up on someone elses country with an army navy or air force or to conceal the death and destruction that they inflict. Armed forces around the world will try to counter this by assembling moving from home bases and maneuvering on the front lines in more dispersed ways hiding as much as possible in plain sight. They will mostly fail but the fleet of commercial vans moving small numbers of heavy artillery rounds on wellvaried routes from West to East in Ukraine shows what can be done. The success of both shoulderlaunched and heavier antitank and antiaircraft missiles against columns of armored vehicles and streams of aircraftplus the undisputed vulnerability of the whole of Ukraine to Russias longrange cruise and ballistic missiles and the sinking of the Russian warship Moskvashow that precision weapons are ending the primacy of the platforms and headquarters that have dominated battlefields since the early th century. One precision missile even if it costs tens of thousands of dollars can destroy a platform that costs many millions and put the lives of its crew in mortal jeopardy. This will transform how armies navies and air forces organize equip and operate. The restraining factor today is the cost and manufacturing complexity of these weapons but as the world lives with the existential peril of a st century Great Power Conflict the urgency to drive down costs and increase inventory will only grow. In digital technologies will transform confrontation and conflict as transparency and precision will merge with advances in robotics autonomy connectivity data in secure cloud and AI. This combination will lead to armed forces that are no longer just people operating equipment but rapidly evolving teams of inhabited uninhabited and autonomous capability. This is a process that starts out by augmenting how todays armed forces organize operate and train but as technology advances and experience grows it will be as transformative as Airbnb has been to accommodation or Uber to transportation. The Digital Age will drive the most profound transformation in how states confront and conflict. This will be a decadeslong competition where the winners are bold enough to move rapidly and the losers have succumbed to the comforts of gentle change. Despite this transformation the nature of war will never change It will be about killing people and breaking their stuff faster than they can do it to you. It will still be a contest of wills an aspect of the human condition that is far from being eradicated for all its ferocity irrationality and despair. The outcome will remain an unscripted mix of reason emotion and chance. Technology only changes how we fight not why.
"ChatGPT is coming for classrooms, hospitals, marketing departments, and everything else as the next great startup boom emerges",Generative AI is the new buzzy tech term. Startups are already raising money using it for everything from content creation to diagnosing a patient.,2023-01-10T10:00:00Z,https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-startup-boom-funding-generative-ai-trend-jasper-runway-2023-1,ChatGPT is coming for classrooms hospitals marketing departments and everything else as the next great startup boom emerges Investors have begun throwing money into the generative AI space. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to look at generative AI as a tool to solve a myriad of problems. As ChatGPT goes viral and generative AI becomes a buzzword many VCs are anxious to invest in the space. If the early s was the era of startups with the elevator pitch of Its like Uber but for fill in the blank we may be entering the era of founders explaining why their companies as like ChatGPT but for well everything. The content creation firm Jasper uses the tech behind ChatGPT and raised million in a Series A in October valuing the company at. billion. Jasper competitor Copy. ai which uses ChatGPT for marketing raised million in Series A in October. Theres generative AI for healthcare with startups like doctorfocused Atropos Health and synthetic healthcare data firm Syntegra all raising funding within the past months. AIenabled video editing startup Runway raised a million Series C in December while AIenhanced design Creative Fabrique raised million in January. In education theres AIgenerated teaching feedback startup TeachFX which raised million in September and AIenhanced textbook company Prof Jim with a million seed round in January. And theres plenty more to come said Lux Capital partner Grace Isford. Were at an exciting inflection point for AI were just at the tip of the iceberg for the many vertical uses cases for large language models beyond the creative industries to spaces like biology manufacturing and healthcare Isford said. Well likely get to the point where AI will be seamlessly integrated into daily workflows. The beauty of recent generative AI models is that they are available for other companies. OpenAI the operator of ChatGPT and DALLE works with Jasper Copy. ai and mental health startup Koko among others. A flood of new companies As access to generative AI models becomes easier founders can spin up their ChatGPT but for plant lovers idea much faster than before. For many investors thats a good thing. They believe generative AI can become as ubiquitous as the cloud or the internet. But down the line theres a risk that startups will be using ChatGPT for ChatGPTs sake. Not all generative AI companies have longevity and not all sectors have problems that generative AI can solve. When Uber began its rise suddenly there was an Uber for pets pet and human ridehailing app SpotOn and an Uber for groceries such as Getir but only a few became as successful or transformative as Uber. For now investors are confident their bets in generative AI will pay off said Josh Constine partner at Signal Fire. As with most trendy sectors there are companies that are or will be worth much more and many more that will never live up to their hype Constine said. But unlike some past cycles where utility felt speculative or at least many years away were already seeing traditional businesses transformed by the breadth and efficiency of generative AI. Its still early days for generative AI and there will still be more new use cases companies will come up with for the technology. Eventually generative AI will lose its luster and startups will have to sink or swim the same way as every company consistent revenue and profits. But for the time being being buzzy is enough.

Police Report Casts Doubt on Elon’s Claim That 'Crazy Stalker' Followed His Son X,"Police investigating Elon Musk’s claim that his two-year-old son, X Æ A-12, was followed by a “crazy stalker” in Los Angeles because of public flight information have cast doubt on the billionaire’s version of what happened.Read more...",2022-12-21T14:53:00Z,https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-police-brandon-collado-car-stalker-son-1849918348,Police investigating Elon Musks claim that his twoyearold son X A was followed by a crazy stalker in Los Angeles because of public flight information have cast doubt on the billionaires version of what happened. In a statement released on Tuesday the South Pasadena police said they were investigating a report of an assault with a deadly weapon involving a vehicle related to the incident on Dec.. A member of Musks security team referred to as a suspect in the release was involved in the incident according to the cops. The security guard claimed a yearold Connecticut man followed him into a gas station. Then the guard hit the mans car according to the police statement. Musk shared a video of the man in a car and the cars license plate on Dec. asking Anyone recognize this person or car The cops have not mentioned that a stalker was involved at all and suggested that what occurred could have been a coincidence. The man who was struck identified himself as Brandon Collado after the incident. According to the South Pasadena police Collado claims he had a verbal confrontation with another driver on Dec. after he pulled into a gas station parking lot to use his phone. Collado told police that the member of Musks security team pulled up in front of him and blocked his path accusing Collado of following him on the freeway. Collado said the security guard drove his car into Collados as the guard left the station. Collado sustained no physical injuries police said. Furthermore while Musk stated that his son X was in the car police said they could not confirm this. Only Collado has filed a police report so far. The police update on the incident and investigation contradicts Musks version of what happened on Dec.. In a tweet on Dec. the Twitter CEO said that Collado had followed the car carrying X thinking that Musk was in it. Musk then claimed that Collado blocked the car from moving and climbed on the hood. At no time during the incident did the victim identify the suspect or indicate the altercation was anything more than coincidental South Pasadena police said in a statement. Yet the polices comment that the incident could have just been a coincidence stands in stark contrast to a Sunday report from the Washington Post. Speaking to the Post Collado said that he had an interest in Musk and in Grimes the mother of two of Musks children including X. Grimes whose real name is Claire Boucher lives in a house near the gas station. Collado told the Post that he was a driver for Uber Eats and was in the area to make deliveries and to visit a friend. He also said that he believed Boucher was sending him secret messages via her Instagram posts that Musk was monitoring his location in realtime and that Musk could block him from receiving work through Uber Eats. I am the guy in this video Collado tweeted at Musk as reported by the Post. You have connections to me and have stalked me and my family for over a year. Gizmodo was unable to find the tweet from Collado referenced by the Post. Musk stated that the incident involving his son had been facilitated by Jack Sweeney the university student who runs the ElonJet account on social media that tracks flights from his private jet using public information. However the Post reported that the incident with Collado had taken place at a gas station miles away from the Los Angeles airport and hours after ElonJet posted the location of Musks plane. After the alleged incident involving his son Musk banned Sweeney from Twitter and announced a policy change banning realtime doxxing sharing of anyones location because it was a risk to physical safety. Musk then went on a blocking spree and suspended journalists on Twitter for sharing basically assassination coordinates for him and his family. In Musk parlance this apparently means tweeting about ElonJet. The Twitter CEO has said that he will be taking legal action against Sweeney ElonJets operator who still tracks his private plane on other social media platforms.
