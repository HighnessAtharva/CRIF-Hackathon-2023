The longest battle for House speaker in 164 years finally ended early Saturday culminating with the GOPs Kevin McCarthy being elected on the 15th ballot. It shouldve been the most stirring moment after days of Republican struggle on the House floor but it wasnt. Far more memorable was the speech that followed delivered by House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries before he handed the speakers gavel to McCarthy in a display of the peaceful transfer of power. Paying tribute to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and touting achievements of the previous Congress Jeffries then turned to the most unforgettable part of his address the ABCs. He began each line consecutively with the letters from A to Z passionately defending American values of democracy and compassion over fascism and hate. But it wasnt just this use of a literary device that was so extraordinary even though that was a big part of why the speech went viral. No Jeffries words were so striking because they should have been the ones the new House speaker delivered. Instead McCarthy vowed that House Republicans first bill will repeal funding for 87000 new IRS agents. Later speaking to reporters in the halls of Congress he praised former President Donald Trump the man the January 6 committees final report concluded was the central cause of the 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Jeffries has consistently lived up to his first name Hakeem which translates from Arabic into a wise or learned person seen as a fountain of deep knowledge. The lawmaker from New York City is Baptist but as a Muslim I wish he were Muslim His speech in Saturdays early hours was the most recent example of his wisdom. The first Black leader of any major party in Congress told the House chamber We believe that in America our diversity is a strength it is not a weakness. He also offered our hand of partnership to the Republicans saying We extend and intend to try and find common ground whenever and wherever possible on behalf of the American people. Yet Jeffries vowed that Democrats will never compromise our principles. The newly swornin Democratic leader followed this pledge with the most impressive part of his speech listing each principle literally from A to Z. He began by making it clear Democrats reject so much that has come to define Trumpism House Democrats will always put American values over autocracy benevolence over bigotry the Constitution over the cult democracy over demagogues freedom over fascism governing over gaslighting hopefulness over hatred. Jeers vied with applause in the House when he reached the middle of this poetic passage with a dig at Trump maturity over MaraLago. Jeffries continued with an alphabetical recitation of what Democrats will defend and reject quality of life issues over QAnon reason over racism substance over slander triumph over tyranny understanding over ugliness voting rights over voter suppression. He sent people Googling the definition of one word when he reached the letter X and said xenial over xenophobia. In this context xenial means warm welcoming and hospitable. Jeffries brought this passage to a close with the line zealous representation over zerosum confrontation shortly thereafter ending by vowing Democrats will always do the right thing by the American people. But these are the words McCarthy should have delivered making it clear he denounces autocracy fascism and the grave threats facing our democracy by Trump and the MAGA wing of the Republican Party. Its not that the House GOP leader doesnt grasp these threats. Only a week after the January 6 2021 attack McCarthy took to the House floor and proclaimed without any ambiguity about Trump The President bears responsibility for Wednesdays attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding. But fastforward to the day after the twoyear anniversary of the January 6 attack. Minutes after leaving the House the newly elected speaker paid tribute to Trump. I do want to especially thank President Trump. I dont think you should doubt anybody should doubt his influence McCarthy said adding He was with me from the beginning. So thank you President Trump. Thank you to the man who refused to accept losing the 2020 election and whose words and actions inspired his supporters to attack the Capitol Thats not what the speaker of the House should be saying. After receiving the speakers gavel McCarthy did have some nice moments such as when he said to Jeffries There will be times we will agree and many times we will differ. I promise that our debates will be passionate but never personal. In closing the speaker included these commendable lines Our nation is worth fighting for. Our future is worth fighting for. Get our free weekly newsletter But these are words without meaning given McCarthys track record of flipflopping on key issues such as standing up to Trump over January 6 to remaining silent over the lies by new GOP Rep. George Santos whose vote he desperately needed in the speakership battle. In his speech Jeffries unapologetically defended American values and our democratic republic if only we had a speaker who had the courage to do the same.

These 5 Big Techs have wiped out an eye-popping $3.65 trillion in market value over a torrid year for stocks,"Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta have each seen over $500 billion wiped off their market caps this year.",2022-12-22T10:51:53Z,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-crash-big-tech-amazon-apple-google-microsoft-facebook-2022-12,The Big Five tech stocks together have shed 3. 65 trillion in market value this year so far. Rising interest rates and the threat of a recession have fueled a brutal selloff in US stocks in 2022. Apple Microsoft Alphabet Amazon and Meta Platforms have each erased over 500 billion in market value. Just five Big Tech stocks have together lost 3. 65 trillion in market value this year as the Federal Reserves rapid interestrate hikes hammered the share price of some of the USs bestknown companies. Google parent Alphabet Amazon Meta Platforms Microsoft and Apple collectively seen as the Big Five tech stocks have each seen 500 billion erased from their market cap in 2022 so far according to data from Refinitiv. Those wipeouts have come in a year where the benchmark SP 500 stock market index has plummeted nearly 19 and the techheavy Nasdaq has plunged just under 32 as of Wednesdays close. The Feds aggressive interestrate hikes have helped fuel the slide in stocks overall but have particularly hit techs and other growth companies. The US central bank has raised its policy rate from nearzero in March to around 4. 5 by December to try to bring down inflation that has been running at fourdecade highs. Higher interest rates encourage people to save rather than spend and lift the cost of borrowing both of which drag on companies share price. And they tend to particularly weigh on stocks for fastgrowing companies like the Big Five as an increased cost of borrowing reduces their future cash flows which is the primary basis for their valuations. Facebook parent Meta and Amazon each suffered major hits to their market caps after they warned a recession in 2023 would lead to a fall in their earnings. Meta shares crashed 24 in a single day in October after it missed on earnings and flagged a slowdown in digital ad spending a risk mentioned by several in the online sector. The social media giant whose shift to the metaverse hasnt been well received by many analysts has shed 635 billion in market value this year according to Refinitiv. Its market cap stands at 318 billion after starting 2022 at 953 billion. Meanwhile Amazon plunged 11 the same month after it put out a gloomy sales forecast for the key holiday season. The online retail giant has wiped out 806 billion in 2022 so far losing its trilliondollar market cap for the first time since April 2020. Its at 885 billion now from 1. 691 trillion. Alphabets market value fell by 758 billion from 1. 921 trillion to 1. 163 trillion. Meanwhile Microsoft slipped from 2. 525 trillion to 1. 822 trillion for a drop of 703 billion. Apples total valuation tumbled 747 billion from its 2. 902 trillion level at the start of 2022. But it remains the worlds largest company with a market capitalization of just under 2. 155 trillion. Adding Tesla to the five Big Techs would take the groups total market value losses to 4. 2 trillion. The electricvehicle manufacturers share price has plummeted 61 this year as investors fret about the impact of Elon Musks Twitter takeover and an economic slowdown in China weighs on sales numbers. Thats wiped 572 billion off of Teslas market capitalization. This story was amended to correct the figure for the drop in market cap for Amazon.

Employee offboarding: A data privacy and compliance primer for HR and IT,Concerned about the challenge of compliance with the alphabet soup of global data privacy laws? Read on for analysis and strategies.,2022-12-20T19:45:13Z,https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/employee-offboarding-a-data-privacy-and-compliance-primer-for-hr-and-it/,The issue of data privacy has risen in priority as the volume of data breaches multiplies along with the implications for organizations and HR departments. After all tens of billions of personal records have been exposed in recent years. Each breach spurs regulators to add safeguards similar to the European Unions General Data Privacy Regulation GDPR which became law in 2016. Already the GDPR has resulted in fines for close to 1000 organizations to the tune of more than 1. 25 billion euros. Amazon Europe takes top prize with a whopping 0. 75 billion levy. Other highprofile companies assessed large GDPR fines include WhatsApp Google Target Yahoo Marriott Equifax and Facebook. GDPR also enables individuals to seek damages in court from anyone being careless with their personal health or other sensitive information records. Similar laws are in evidence around the globe such as the New Zealand Privacy Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA. Others are coming such as Indias Personal Data Protection Bill and possibly an American Data Privacy and Protection Act. Event Intelligent Security Summit OnDemand Learn the critical role of AI ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies. Watch ondemand sessions today. Beyond data security and protection standards numerous government and industry regulations like GDPR bind workforce data said James McQuivey VP and principal analyst at Forrester Research. These complex regulations will increase making it more difficult to determine what employee and workforce information you can collect and how you can use it. Privacy and offboarding With so much potential fallout from privacy violations its no wonder that HR departments are far more prominent in businesses than they used to be. Employees are routinely assigned training regarding sharing of information data privacy policies and security processes. One of the biggest dangers related to privacy and data breaches in HR concerns employee offboarding. It can be all too easy for a departing person to waltz out the door with a USB drive full of customer records or retain access to certain systems hoping to profit at a later date. A Beyond Identity study found that 83 of former employees could still access some corporate accounts. Unless HR is very thorough in the offboarding process people can find ways to get into some systems. Another finding Half of businesses dont use automated processes to change user passwords when someone leaves and only a third delete user accounts as part of the offboarding process. Consequently it shouldnt be a surprise that 25 of employees admitted to having taken client information from a former employer. This ranges from client contact and financial information to entire CRM databases. Employers should institute security measures in offboarding such as disabling email access removing all rights disabling access to all applications and asking employees to confirm that they have returned all corporate personal data assets and have not kept any company data said Uzy Hadad Ph. D. founder and CEO of Privya an artificial intelligence AIbased data protection and compliance vendor. As well as disabling user accounts organizations should follow applicable privacy rules in regard to retaining email data for prescribed periods and deleting personal data to protect the rights of the former employee. Employers are allowed to keep information about employees and the reason for termination both as a legal obligation and as a means of protecting themselves in case an employee challenges the termination said Hadad. Other data about the employee such as information relating to a medical condition or private emails that are not required for any potential future legal dispute should be deleted. Other data privacy and compliance rules may apply Rules vary from country to country and region to region. Hadad pointed out that GDPR doesnt say much about the specifics of data protection in the context of employment or termination of employment. The regulation allows member states to set their own guidelines for the processing of employee personal data both during and after employment according to Article 88 of GDPR. Meanwhile in California the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA goes into effect on January 1 2023 and significantly amends the CCPA. It could be a minefield for employers if they dont manage employee data appropriately. The CPRA will eliminate the CCPAs employeedata exemptions said Hadad. All provisions about personal data will now also apply to employee data including all rights transparency obligations impact assessment and rules about selling personal data and treating sensitive data. Using technology to address privacy and offboarding IT and HR need to do more policy enforcement to avoid potential harm from departing or former employees. Organizations should assess the data they have the many places it resides and how it applies to employee privacy and offboarding processes. Legacy systems for example should be checked for such data as part of a data inventory. Other tools to implement include encrypting employee data and anonymizing it via data masking. Localized cloud hosting too might be a way to avoid falling afoul of GDPR and other restrictions against transferring data outside one geographic zone or across national boundaries. Regular vulnerability assessments are another way organizations can ensure employee data is secured. These should include thirdparty penetration tests. Vulnerability scans help identify multiple blind spots in data security transference and weaknesses said Anastasios Gkouletsos cybersecurity lead and data protection at HR platform Omnipresent. There are several vendors that can also help identify compliance gaps but in general GDPR requires you to maintain a resilient IT infrastructure wherein your organizational and security measures are working effectively. Endpoint security therefore should be an obvious priority for every company particularly those operating globally. Data privacy protections wont be effective unless supported by security features such as firewalls malware removal ransomware protection device management password manager patch management and business VPNs or other means of secure connection. Dont forget about information security policies relating to areas such as privacy employee offboarding access controls change management and data integrity. McQuivey of Forrester adds cloudbased human capital management HCM solutions to the list of technology safeguards. Some modern HCM systems are equipped with features to avoid violating data privacy and data movement rules. Whenever data is placed in the cloud though businesses should ensure it is stored only in permitted locations. For example archived data often gets dumped into cold storage tiers in the cloud. That could lead to loss of control of its location. An active archive combination of open system applications and different types of disk and tape hardware contains features that monitor and migrate data across multiple storage devices while maintaining fast user accessibility and keeping track of data privacy requirements. Alternatively the organization can harness the cloud for applications while retaining all data locally as a way to stay on top of compliance. Since data and applications dont need to be geographically colocated you can launch applications in the cloud but keep the data that the application needs onprem said Steve Wallo CTO of Vcinity. Get used to complexity and regional variations Dealing with privacy laws is far from easy. Unless the U. S. federal government passes something soon expect multiple states to pass their own rules. This will add complexity akin to the sales tax nightmare that businesses deal with each state has a different sales tax percentage and policy. Globally too countries and regional authorities such as the EU will enact laws impacting certain areas. It is up to IT and HR to stay on top of all this. The current global patchwork of data sovereignty and privacy laws has made it more complicated than ever for businesses to create consistent policies on data sharing integration and compliance said Danny Sandwell senior solutions strategist Quest. This will continue to have a significant impact on organizations ability to maximize the use of data across their IT infrastructure unless they put together clear plans for data integration and governance. In 2023 the passing of more data sovereignty and sharing laws will spur businesses to invest in getting visibility into their data and creating clear plans for sharing and integration across their IT landscape.

S. government antitrust lawsuit WASHINGTON Jan 11 Reuters Google parent Alphabet GOOGL. O on Wednesday argued that a court should toss out a government antitrust lawsuit against it saying that agreements it made with Apple and others to make Google the default search engine do not bar smartphone makers from promoting rivals. The statements which were revealed in a redacted version of a motion filed last month asking the judge to toss out the lawsuit preview the tech giants arguments for a highstakes court case expected to go to trial in September. If Google loses it could be forced to spin off key assets. In December Google asked Judge Amit Mehta of the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia to throw out both the antitrust case that the Justice Department filed in 2020 along with 11 states as well as a related complaint brought by 35 states led by Colorado. The Justice Departments lawsuit filed by the Trump administration alleged that Google violated antitrust law in how it maintained dominance in search and search advertising. For example it pointed to billions of dollars that Google paid annually to Apple AAPL. O LG Electronics Inc 066570. KS and others to ensure that Google search was the default on their devices. In its 51page filing Google argued that Mehta should throw out the Justice Department case in part because the companys agreements with Apple and others allow them to promote rivals like Microsofts MSFT. O Bing search engine. The company also argued that its search engine was popular with browsers and consumers entirely because of its quality and that it was inappropriate for the government to require Google to refrain from competing to be the default on smartphones. Requiring Google not to compete vigorously or requiring browser developers to alter their product designs and provide a worse experience for their customers would turn competition law on its head the company said in the filing. The company also argued that there was no evidence that agreements that Google made related to Google Assistant or InternetofThings devices hurt competition. Google faces additional allegations of antitrust violations from dozens of states. The lawsuit filed by Colorado and others which was also filed in 2020 also alleges that Google illegally limits rivals ability to operate its Search Ads 360 tool used by advertisers to manage online marketing campaigns. It also argues that Google broke antitrust law to hamper rivals such as traveloriented websites.

'Kraken' subvariant name beats 'alphabet soup' moniker for XBB.1.5: biologist - Rocky Mountain Outlook - Bow Valley News,"<ol><li>'Kraken' subvariant name beats 'alphabet soup' moniker for XBB.1.5: biologist  Rocky Mountain Outlook - Bow Valley News
</li><li>Opinion: The COVID 'Kraken' has been released, but it's not a variant – it's our indifference  The Globe and Mail
</li><…",2023-01-09T22:07:57Z,https://www.rmotoday.com/lifestyle-news/kraken-subvariant-name-beats-alphabet-soup-moniker-for-xbb15-biologist-6351664,As cases of the Omicron subvariant XBB. 1. 5 increased in some countries a Canadian evolutionary biologist says he saw the need for a nickname to spark interest in notable lineages instead of hardtoremember strings of letters and numbers. Ryan Gregory of the University of Guelph dubbed the latest subvariant Kraken the name of a Scandinavian mythological sea creature as more people fell ill with XBB. 1. 5 in the northeast United States last month. The Centers for Disease Control estimates the subvariant makes up the majority of cases in that region. The name Kraken was agreed upon by Gregorys eclectic online community of global variant trackers including those who do wastewater analysis as well as citizen scientists who sift through data to identify new mutations. Gregory says the group adopted monikers for previous Omicron subvariants Gryphon XBB a creature that is a mix of a lion and an eagle and Hippogryph XBB. 1 a combination of Gryphon and a horse. Kraken is the latest addition to the XBB family of subvariants and is a combination of two earlier subtypes. The World Health Organization used the Greek alphabet to categorize variants of concern Alpha B. 1. 1. 7 Beta B. 1. 351 Gamma P. 1 Delta B. 1. 617. 2 and Omicron B. 1. 1. 529 which has spawned multiple descendent sublineages. Gregory said the Omicron subvariant BA. 2. 75 seemed to get more attention after an online post dubbed it Centaurus suggesting that a snappy name could better inform the public about the evolution of Omicron. WHY USE MYTHICAL CREATURES Its easier if they have a more recognizable name than just an alphabet soup says Gregory adding thatany type of categorization would work including astronomical names. Gregory says the current naming system is difficult to understand by the general public. It involves a group of scientists that use a software program called Pangolin to track a variants evolutionary history. A sequence of letters starting with A are separated by a period followed by numbers indicating branches from a particular lineage. Gregory says he wants to offer clear information about the evolutionary trees of variants and how their linages are related. I normally work on genome evolution in animals. So youre talking about slow evolution. Viral evolution in the span of a couple of months is just light speed for someone like me. WHAT DO OTHERS IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THINK British Columbias provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry agrees the current naming system gets complicated. But she thinks a sea monster is not the best descriptor. This is my dilemma. How do you walk that tightropesays Henry. Because we want people to be aware and concerned but we dont want people to be panicked. And sometimes giving these types of mythical names creates a sense of fear that hopefully is not warranted. Ive heard from people who say Oh my gosh. This is going to come. I have no control over it its going to cause more severe illness Im more at risk. People are feeling very vulnerable after what weve been through. IS XBB. 1. 5 MORE CONTAGIOUS OR SEVERE While the WHO has said XBB. 1. 5 is the most transmissible subvariant so far it has not taken off in Canada. Henry says it can bind more easily to a specific protein called ACE2 in the back of the nose and throat where the SARS CoV2 virus enters the body triggering infection. However she says XBB. 1. 5 has not led to more severe illness or an increase in hospitalizations for people who are vaccinated and because of hybrid immunity from infection. We have to watch and we have to continue to monitor. But right now what were seeing is the things that have worked for all of Omicron over the last year are still things that are going to protect us from hospitalization severe illness and death Henry says of measures like uptodate vaccinations and masking in crowded indoor spaces. The bivalent vaccine in particular gives us good protection against infections for the first little while but also against severe illness. Im not worried she says of concerns that hospitals could be overburdened by XBB. 1. 5. HOW MANY DETECTIONS OF XBB. 1. 5 ARE IN CANADA Omicron and its sublineages are circulating in various provinces but the number of XBB. 1. 5 infections is not known. The Public Health Agency of Canada said Monday that 42 detections of the subvariant had been identified through genome sequencing. However there is currently a delay in reporting late December and early January detections from provinces and territories due to the holiday period so the numbers are expected to increase by the end of the week the agency said in a statement. It has said the proportion and growth rates would not be provided until there are sufficient data. Provinces and territories regularly providegenome sequencing data which includes a percentage of positive COVID19 tests that are sequenced to reveal the genetic code of the virus indicating which variant is involved. British Columbia for instance reported 12 detections of XBB. 1. 5 last week through whole genome testing of samples from all patients hospitalized with COVID19 and some residents of longterm care homes. However Henry says that does not amount to 12 cases. Henry notes more than 100 subvariants of Omicron have been detected so far in B. C. The province like others is also monitoring wastewater. The public health agency said that because XBB. 1. 5 is the result of genomes from two different strains spliced together that can complicate its detection in wastewater if it is circulating only at low levels. However genomic sequencing is revealing a low presence of the subvariant in municipal wastewater samples it said. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 6 2023.

Why a $67bn takeover could make Microsoft a gaming behemoth,"With the acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard in the works, the company is facing investigations by trade commissions the world over. If the deal goes through, could it help the forgotten tech giant gain new relevance?<ul><li>Don’t get TechScape …",2023-01-03T11:51:46Z,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/03/why-a-67bn-takeover-could-make-microsoft-a-gaming-behemoth,Microsoft is the forgotten tech giant. Despite being the worlds secondlargest public company by market capitalisation it got left out of the snappy acronym for the big five FAANG alongside Facebook Amazon Apple and Google in favour of Netflix a company seven percent its size. Even when you add them to the equation and GAFAM seems the most popular ordering though given Google and Facebooks rebrands to Alphabet and Meta it should really be MAMAA Microsoft has avoided the scrutiny its peers have been subjected to. Part of that is to do with where the companies make their profits. Microsofts consumer brands are large and popular but dont feel like unstoppable behemoths compared to the rest of the MAMAAs. Amazon towers over ecommerce Meta owns social networking Alphabet dominates web browsers email and search while Apple practically prints money with a phone that can credibly be called the most successful consumer product ever released. Microsoft though makes its money through enterprise sales and cloud computing and its unbroken power over desktop operating systems seems like a relic of the past rather than a meaningful focus of attention in the present. The company has been making the most of that state of affairs. Its president Brad Smith the second most powerful person at the company after chief executive Satya Nadella has gained a reputation for being the leader of the proregulation forces of the tech industry. When we met in the hazy past of 2019 he warned that the sector would soon feel the backlash of years of acting like if its legal its acceptable and a few months later he targeted Apple for taking a cut of up to 30 of all economic activity on the iPhone. The same strategy sees Microsoft lean in to the markets where it trails the competition endorsing policies and practices that cost it little but its competitors lots. In February 2021 Smith endorsed an Australian proposal requiring payments for news content accepting a small cost for Microsofts Bing to support a massive one for Google. Two months after that the company put pressure on Apple and its massive App Store profits by abolishing its own Windows app store fees. For a while the approach worked. Compare two acquisitions in 2021 Facebook tried to buy a VR developer called Within which makes a popular fitness app for Oculus called Supernatural. The deal was valued at just 400m a tiny amount for a Facebook acquisition but a large payout for a company with one major product in a fairly niche sector. Nonetheless the Federal Trade Commission FTC in the US sued to stop it in July this year arguing that Meta is trying to buy its way to the top. Just a few months before the Within acquisition however Microsoft had successfully pulled off a much bigger coup spending 7. 5bn to acquire ZeniMax the video game publisher that owns properties including Skyrim Doom and Fallout. The deal went off without a hitch giving Microsoft a flagship set of firstparty developers and hundreds of titles to offer for free to subscribers of its Xbox Game Pass service. Siren call Now though Microsofts nonstick coating is rubbing off. In January 2022 the company announced another planned acquisition and it was a monster a 68. 7bn cash purchase of Activision Blizzard the titan publisher of World of Warcraft Candy Crush Starcraft and Call of Duty. It clearly expected the acquisition to go through as smoothly as the ZeniMax purchase had. Despite the clear strategic benefits the purchase felt like an impulse buy taking advantage of a sinking stock price at the company following months of legal wrangling over a sexual harassment scandal as well as weak financial results from Activision Blizzard itself. Instead Microsoft found itself plunged into a morass of investigations the world over. The EU competition commission the UKs Competition and Markets Authority and the FTC have all started investigations into the takeover and in December the FTC moved to block it. The first pretrial hearing in that case starts today 3 January. The purchase isnt controversial just because of the cost of the buyout but also because of one game Call of Duty. The military shooter series is one of the most commercially successful game series of all time. Few other titles are guaranteed as many sales and those that are like Grand Theft Auto or The Legend of Zelda are rare entries in the release calendar averaging two or so publications a decade. Call of Duty by contrast is a machine that Activision has rebuilt itself to power. Three development studios rotate producing one new entry every year with a host of smaller units providing support in roles like asset creation and play testing and a new massively successful freetoplay Fortnite competitor Warzone bolted on top of the whole thing. The cinematic singleplayer campaigns are renowned for being interactive blockbusters but the multiplayer mode are where the series dominates. There are other benefits to buying the company. Microsoft could use King the Activision Blizzard subsidiary that makes Candy Crush to get a foothold in mobile gaming or take the nine million players who still subscribe to World of Warcraft and bring them into the Game Pass ecosystem. But at its heart the purchase is about Call of Duty and specifically Game Pass. Microsoft has been very clear about what its not trying to do. Its not trying to make Call of Duty an Xbox exclusive. The company has committed to signing a consent decree if the FTC will accept it which would bind it to offering the game on other platforms. And its already made a deal with Nintendo to bring the series to the Switch the first to be available on a Nintendo console since Ghosts in 2013. But speaking to industry insiders the fear on the part of Microsofts competitors chiefly Sony which makes the PlayStation isnt about exclusivity narrowly defined. Instead its about what happens to the industry if Xbox becomes the best place to play Call of Duty either because its developed for those platforms and ported to others halfheartedly or simply because its available for free with Game Pass on Xbox and for a 70 price tag on PlayStation. They worry that the centre of gravity of online gaming would gradually shift to Xbox first taking the Call of Duty players then taking the people who play other games with them and then taking anyone who plays games online at all. It might be hard to feel too sorry for Sony a company that indisputably is the market leader in home consoles and has used its heft to win battles before but regulators are paying attention. After half a decade of being the gentle giant everyone loves to forget might 2023 be the year Microsoft remembers why its competitors all live in fear of antitrust enforcement If you want to read the complete version of the newsletter please subscribe to receive TechScape in your inbox every Tuesday.

O is mulling a headsIwin tailsIalso win AI deal. A mooted 10 billion investment reported by Semafor in the maker of the popular ChatGPT could reshape Microsofts software business. Even if it flops CEO Satya Nadella will slow a rival and possibly regain much of its investment. The 29 billion price tag placed on OpenAI is high but defensible. The company aims to grow sales to 1 billion next year according to a Reuters report. That would value the firm at 29 times 2024 revenue. Enterprise software group Snowflake SNOW. N is trading at 13 times 2024 revenue but its growing nowhere near OpenAIs rate. And the investment is a pittance compared to Microsofts market capitalization of 1. 7 trillion and 107 billion of cash on hand. The financial potential of artificial intelligence though is vast and probably bigger than all current software spending. Designing a better search engine one that intuitively knows exactly what users are looking for would be a major threat to Google Owner Alphabets GOOGL. O 1. 1 trillion valuation. The next step could be AI programs that quickly write better software and design more effective drugs creating even bigger potential markets. Moreover the biggest uses for new IT platforms often emerge after experimentation in the wild. Of course the odds are OpenAI will fade away as most tech firms do. Even then Microsofts investment may not be wasted. Alphabet has spent about 100 billion on research and development betting hard on such products over the past three years alone and will grow its spending by 13 annually in the next three years Morgan Stanley reckons. By locking up a promising firm and scarce researchers Microsoft may prevent Alphabet from winning and may force it to raise spending. Clever dealmaking cuts Microsofts risk further. OpenAI already runs on Microsofts Azure cloud platform thanks to a 2019 agreement between the two. The proposed investment means OpenAI can grow its business faster which also benefits Azure a part of Microsoft that investors value highly. Furthermore the new agreement gives Microsoft 75 of OpenAIs profit until its investment is recouped. Tech bets may be coin flips but this one is worth taking.

Suit accusing YouTube of tracking children is back on after appeal,"DreamWorks, Cartoon Network, and others accused of illegally luring kids to YouTube.",2022-12-29T17:35:49Z,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/appeals-court-revives-lawsuit-over-youtube-tracking-children-online/,An appeals court has revived a lawsuit that accuses Google YouTube DreamWorks and a handful of toymakers of tracking the activity on YouTube of children under 13. In an opinion released Wednesday the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act does not bar lawsuits based on individual state privacy laws. Passed in 1998 and amended in 2012 COPPA requires websites to obtain parental consent for the collection and dissemination of personally identifiable information of children under the age of 13. COPPA gives the FTC and state attorneys general the ability to investigate and levy fines for violations of the law. Several states across the US have laws similar to COPPA on the books. The revived lawsuit cites laws in California Colorado Indiana and Massachusetts to argue that Hasbro DreamWorks Mattel and the Cartoon Network illegally lured children to their YouTube channels in order to target them with ads. A federal judge in San Francisco dismissed the original lawsuit ruling that COPPA bars individuals from suing companies for privacy violations. In a unanimous decision the Ninth Circuit judges hearing the appeal disagreed with the district courts reasoning. COPPA is not in fact the only route to enforcement according to the ruling. Since the bar on inconsistent state laws implicitly preserves consistent state substantive laws it would be nonsensical to assume Congress intended to simultaneously preclude all state remedies for violations of those laws wrote Judge Margaret McKeown. This is not the first time YouTube has faced legal problems for how it handles childrens data. The Alphabet subsidiary was fined 170 million by the FTC and the New York state attorney general in 2019 for COPPA violations. The case which seeks damages for a sevenyear time period between 2013 and 2020 now heads back to district court.

Tim Cook's pay is falling 40% this year – but he's cool with it,"According to a filing, the Apple CEO requested that the board lower his pay after pushback for a previous pay package totaling nearly $99 million.",2023-01-12T23:27:06Z,https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-taking-pay-cut-stock-based-compensation-apple-filing-2023-1,Tim Cooks pay is falling 40 this year but hes cool with it Tim Cooks 2023 pay package will be slashed by 40 to 49 million according to an SEC filing. The cut was done at Cooks request after his paydays in previous years faced pushback among some shareholders. Tim Cook is getting a hefty pay cut in 2023 but he asked for it. According to a filing by Apple with the SEC Cooks target total compensation for 2023 will be 49 million more than 40 below what he was paid in 2022. The Apple CEO will also see more pay tied to Apples stock performance than in previous years. While such a massive CEO pay cut might usually indicate internal issues within a company Cook is getting a smaller paycheck at his request after huge pay packages in previous years caused controversy among Apple shareholders. Last year a top shareholder advisory firm urged Apple investors to vote against Cooks pay package which totaled nearly 99 million for 2021 or 1447x the median salary of an Apple employee. According to the SEC filing Apple shareholders expressed concern over the amount of Mr. Cooks total target compensation due to the size of his 2021 and 2022 equity awards to the companys compensation committee. The shareholders also expressed a preference for a higher percentage of Mr. Cooks equity award to be performancebased. Apple did not immediately respond to Insiders request for additional comment.

Verily (an Google/Alphabet Bet) eliminates off 15% of it's staff,"This is an important day for Verily, as we announce our refined strategy, prioritized portfolio and simplified operating model. This is work...",2023-01-11T23:09:18Z,https://verily.com/blog/one-verily-forward/,Shared by CEO Stephen Gillett with all Verily employees today This is an important day for Verily as we announce our refined strategy prioritized portfolio and simplified operating model. This is work that has been in process for many months and its time to begin sharing our path forward with you. Before detailing all of the changes that will begin to roll out today and fair warning this is a long email I want to thank each of you for everything that youve brought and contributed to Verily. Verily is the company it is today due to the combination of your expertise and determination to make a difference. Thats a big part of what I call the Verily magic and that is testament to all of you and what you bring to your work every day. Since being spun out of X seven years ago Verily has made significant accomplishments across a broad range of healthcare initiatives with blue chip and specialty partners. We have advanced foundational capabilities that allow us to improve healthcare from many vantage points and have been chosen by a wide variety of partners we respect and admire who are equally interested in novel approaches. Weve collaborated with distinguished healthcare and industry leaders including the Mayo Clinic Swiss Re Dexcom LOreal Otsuka Highmark Health iRhythm Resmed and SoseiHeptares among many others. These partnerships have resulted in extraordinary products and innovation. They include the development of technology for Dexcoms G6 and G7 continuous glucose monitors CGM the smallest CGMs of their kind. We built Project Baseline whose studies have included over 600K people as weve worked with organizations such as the American Heart Association Crohns and Colitis Foundation and major pharmaceutical companies. We advanced our Onduo and Granular joint ventures which weve now taken full control of to allow for cost savings and greater integration with other Verily products. Our path forward is driven by the need to make deliberate choices about where we can have the greatest impact in precision health and to put ourselves on a faster path to sustained commercial success. Its about accelerating the things that are working best and that customers need the most. Weve made some hard but necessary choices to focus our resources where we can make a meaningful difference and that will help us build a business that impacts the healthcare ecosystem with interconnected products as we grow. At a high level heres what is happening We are making changes that refine our strategy prioritize our product portfolio and simplify our operating model. We will advance fewer initiatives with greater resources. In doing so Verily will move from multiple lines of business to one centralized product organization with increasingly connected healthcare solutions. Specifically that means We will center our strategyon closing the gap between research and care and becoming the data and evidence backbone for precision health with a focus on applying AI and data science to accelerate learning and improve outcomes. We will also continue to grow our precision risk solution Granular. Advancing precision health remains our purpose with the goal to ultimately be operating in all areas of precision health. We will prioritize productsthat accelerate evidence generation and deliver more precise interventions and that combine solutions from both research and care to drive even greater value over time all underpinned by Verilys commitment to transparency privacy and health access. We will make changes to our operating modelthat simplify how we work and promote more One Verily collaboration across our teams. We are designing complexity out of Verily. As a result Amy Abernethy Scott Burke and Lisa Greenbaum will all assume new responsibilities as we go forward. We will talk about all of this in more detail shortly but here is what that means for our products and the way we work. Focusing our product portfolio Going forward we are going to do fewer things and leverage our strengths and capabilities in the process. This aligns with our purpose and puts us on a faster path to value creation for our customers and ultimate commercial success. Products will largely fall into research or care. ResearchThis includes products and services designed for sponsors and research sites and aimed at bringing safe and effective therapies to more people more efficiently. This covers solutions that accelerate clinical trials build real world datasets that improve the diversity and representativeness of research and discover targets that can result in new medicines for patients building on Verilys Clinical Research SignalPath and Terra offerings. It also includes a precision measures suite that provides novel approaches to better characterize aspects of health and elements of our current Immune Profiler Digital Pathology and devices offerings. CareThis refers to products and experiences designed to help people make more informed choices for their individual health and for healthcare professionals to better tailor care. This covers personalized care solutions that support patients with chronic conditions and engage patients in clinical research and integrates elements of Onduo and Project Baseline. It also includes products and services that speed diagnosis and improve the delivery of care such as Verily Retinal Service an AIbased solution in development to aid in the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Granular our precision risk solution subsidiary OneFifteen and select early investments will remain as separate elements of the Verily portfolio. Wastewater Debug and RD Lab efforts will continue as ongoing research and development investments. Now the hardest part. To enable greater focus on our updated portfolio we are discontinuing the development of Verily Value Suite and some earlystage products including our work in remote patient monitoring for heart failure and microneedles for drug delivery. While these programs are promising and led by talented Veeps and some of their innovations will integrate into our other core solutions we cannot do everything and have had to make some difficult choices. Some Veeps will be redeployed to other teams others will unfortunately be leaving us. These people have helped make Verily the company it is today and I know how hard it is to see valued friends and colleagues depart. I have promised you all transparency in what were doing and this means we have eliminated approximately 15 percent of Verily roles due to discontinued programs full control of Granular and Onduo and redundancy in the new centralized organization. Our most immediate priority is ensuring that these Veeps are given the support they need to ease their transitions and we will offer help in many ways over the coming weeks and months ranging from severance to coaching and outplacement services. I am truly grateful for their contributions. Simplifying our operating model and the way we work We will make changes to our operating model that simplify how we work and promote more One Verily collaboration across our teams. Specifically we will move from multiple lines of business to one centralized product organization with increasingly connected healthcare solutions. The new Verily Leadership Team VLT reporting directly to me includes the following individuals and reflects an expansion of responsibilities for some leaders and a deeper collaboration across all of our teams Amy Abernethywill expand her role to become President of Product Development Chief Medical Officer a new position leading commercial product development and clinical teams across Verily and putting product development under one leader versus multiple business unit presidents. Scott Burkewill expand his responsibilities as Verilys Chief Technology Officer adding hardware engineering and devices teams to his existing scope and serving as the bridge between product development and customer needs to ensure products meet and exceed technical and UX expectations. Lisa Greenbaumwill expand her responsibilities in a new Chief Commercial Officer role overseeing sales marketing and corporate strategy teams to ensure a deeper understanding of customer needs and delivery of that intelligence back to the product development team. Cynthia Pattonwill continue in her role as Chief Legal Officer and oversee Verilys legal privacy compliance and government affairs teams. Kerrie Perainowill continue in her role as Chief People Officer and oversee Verilys People Culture PACT teams. Preston Simonswill continue in his role as Chief Information Officer and oversee Verilys IT teams. Denny Weinbergwill continue in his role as Chief Executive Officer of Granular Verilys risk insurance business. We will continue in our search for Verilys next Chief Financial Officer to be announced separately. We are hiring for a new Chief Scientific Officer to be announced separately. Jordi Parramon President of Verilys Devices business will be leaving the company later this year and will stay on as an advisor to help with the transition period. Jordi has been with Verily since our early days and has led the Devices team through many milestones and changes over the years. A personal thank you to Jordi for his leadership and for supporting Verily and his team during this time. We will hold our first Company Update next week on Jan. 18 invitation to follow where well share more about these changes and our path forward. Youll also begin to hear from your new leaders and managers in the coming days and well reestablish the former Ops Chat as a new Veep chat space soon. I know this is a lot to take in at once and this communication is just the beginning of more to follow in the coming weeks. This is a significant transformation for Verily and one that builds on all of the work and contributions over the past seven years. I am confident that we are on the right path and this focused portfolio and streamlined structure will unlock our potential and advance meaningful growth. We would not be here without the passion in our purpose and commitment from you and the Veeps who will be leaving us shortly but who will always be a part of our story and One Verily team. Thank you for your support and belief in our purpose Stephen

During the global pandemic companies ramped up hiring only to reverse course in 2022 with the tech sector leading the job cuts which according to executive coaching firm Challenger Gray Christmas Inc surged 649 from 2021. It is also giving them an advantage to frankly be more responsible for some of the aggressive hiring that occurred during the pandemic Selker said.

The complaint filed on Friday against Alphabet Inc GOOGL. O Meta Platforms Inc META. O Snap Inc SNAP. N and TikTokowner ByteDance with the U. S. District Court claimed they purposefully designed their products to hook young people to their platforms and were creating a mental health crisis. In an emailed statement Meta which owns Facebook said it has developed more than 30 tools to support teens and their families and will continue to work closely with experts policymakers and parents. Google said it has invested heavily in creating safe experiences for children across its platforms and has introduced strong protections and dedicated features to prioritize their well being while Snap said it works closely with many mental health organizations to provide inapp tools and resources for users and that the wellbeing of its community is its top priority. TikTok did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment. In the past the companies have said they aim to create an enjoyable experience for users and exclude harmful content and invest in moderation and content controls. The lawsuit says the companies actions have been a substantial factor in causing a youth mental health crisis. Defendants have successfully exploited the vulnerable brains of youth hooking tens of millions of students across the country into positive feedback loops of excessive use and abuse of Defendants social media platforms the lawsuit said. Students with mental health issues perform worse causing schools to take steps including training teachers to identify and address such symptoms hire trained personnel and create additional resources to warn students about the dangers of social media the complaint said. The lawsuit seeks compensation for monetary damages and other penalties. In 2021 U. S. lawmakers accused Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg of pushing for higher profits at the expense of childrens mental health following testimony by whistleblower Frances Haugen. Facebook has consistently said it disagrees with Haugens characterization that the company failed to protect teen girls on Instagram. The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical Zuckerberg posted on his Facebook page in response. We make money from ads and advertisers consistently tell us they dont want their ads next to harmful or angry content.

Howard who was previously the software giants corporate vice president and deputy general counsel for litigation competition law and compliance joins Morgan Lewis new office in Seattle where the firm launched last summer. The Philadelphiafounded law firm entered Seattle with a 34member team including 14 lawyers from local litigation firm Calfo Eakes which has since stopped operating. Howard called the Calfo Eakes team the finest boutique litigation practice in Seattle. Howard said he most recently worked on special projects for Microsoft after stepping down from the litigation chief role after he was diagnosed with stagefour cancer in 2018. He said he is now cancerfree. Microsofts current litigation head Jon Palmer said in a statement that Howard had an enormous positive impact and the company looks forward to working with him at Morgan Lewis. Howard previously led the white collar and securities litigation practice at law firm Dechert before joining Microsoft in 2010 to lead the litigation team oversee internal investigations and regulatory enforcement matters globally the firm said. He also worked as a federal prosecutor and as an attorney on the White House Counsels task force on the IranContra matter.

Kate Patchen previously associate general counsel for competition at Meta Platforms Inc started at Covington Burling and Ryan Richardson former lead global partnerships counsel at Stripe Inc joined Davis Wright Tremaine. While at Microsoft Howard authored a blog post that made headlines in 2017 in which he said the technology giant planned to move more of its work with law firms to alternative fee arrangements in a shift away from paying outside firms by the hour. Without commenting on Microsofts effort Howard said he thinks there will be continuing discussions between companies and law firms about how best to pay for the value that firms bring to a particular engagement.

Boies Schiller adds Justice Dept prosecutor to white-collar team - Reuters,Law firm Boies Schiller Flexner said Wednesday that it has hired U.S. Justice Department prosecutor Blake Goebel as a partner focused on white-collar defense and complex civil litigation.,2023-01-04T19:36:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/boies-schiller-adds-justice-dept-prosecutor-white-collar-team-2023-01-04/,Boies Schiller adds Justice Dept prosecutor to whitecollar team Companies Law firms Reuters Law firm Boies Schiller Flexner said Wednesday that it has hired U. S. Justice Department prosecutor Blake Goebel as a partner focused on whitecollar defense and complex civil litigation. Goebel who will work in Washington D. C. arrives from the Justice Departments criminal fraud section which investigates and prosecutes many of the departments largest corporate criminal cases. Goebel said he was drawn to Boies Schiller a prominent litigation firm founded by famed trial lawyer David Boies in part because it offered the opportunity to represent both plaintiffs and defendants in civil litigation. The list of law firms that simultaneously do plaintiffs and defense work at a high level is very short Goebel said in a statement. As a former prosecutor the chance to take on sophisticated cases on both sides of the v is incredibly attractive. Boies Schiller has helmed major class action lawsuits against Alphabet Incs Google and insurance giant Blue Cross Blue Shield. The firm is representing investors in the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX in a securities lawsuit against the companys indicted cofounder Sam BankmanFried and a group of celebrities who endorsed the exchange. Goebel said there are many similarities between building a criminal securities fraud case as a prosecutor and a civil case as a plaintiffs lawyer. During his tenure as a Justice Department trial attorney he worked in a unit focused on financial fraud and was part of the team that prosecuted the founder of technology startup Trustify for fraud and money laundering. Boies Schiller has seen a series of departures to rival firms in recent years that has dwindled its roster of lawyers. Boies acknowledged in an interview with Reuters last year that the firm had made some misfires. The firm has also continued to hire however last year bringing on former federal prosecutor Kenya Davis to lead its ESG investigative team in Washington D. C. Goebel declined to comment on the previous departures saying that the firm is in good hands with a group of very talented litigators in place. Our Standards The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
We Chose NanoIDs for PlanetScale’s API,Learn why PlanetScale used NanoID to generate obscure and URL friendly identifiers.,2022-12-29T14:38:27Z,https://planetscale.com/blog/why-we-chose-nanoids-for-planetscales-api,Why we chose NanoIDs for PlanetScales API When we were first building PlanetScales API we needed to figure out what type of identifier wed be using. We knew that we wanted to avoid using integer IDs so that we wouldnt reveal the count of records in all our tables. The common solution to this problem is using a UUID Universally Unique Identifier instead. UUIDs are great because its nearly impossible to generate a duplicate and they obscure your internal IDs. They have one problem though. They take up a lot of space in a URL api. planetscale. comv1deployrequests7cb776c58c124b1a84aa9941b815d873 Try double clicking on that ID to select and copy it. You cant. The browser interprets it as 5 different words. It may seem minor but to build a product that developers love to use we need to care about details like these. Nano ID We decided that we wanted our IDs to be Shorter than a UUID Easy to select with double clicking Low chance of collisions Easy to generate in multiple programming languages we use Ruby and Go on our backend This led us to NanoID which accomplishes exactly that. Here are some examples izkpm55j334u z2n60bhrj7e8 qoucu12dag1x These are much more userfriendly in a URL api. planetscale. comv1deployrequestsizkpm55j334u ID length and collisions An ID collision is when the same ID is generated twice. If this happens seldomly its not a big deal. The application can detect a collision autogenerate a new ID and move on. If this is happening often though it can be a huge problem. The longer and more complex the ID the less likely it is to happen. Determining the complexity needed for the ID depends on the application. In our case we used the NanoID collision tool and decided to use 12 character long IDs with the alphabet of 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. This gives us a 1 probability of a collision in the next 35 years if we are generating 1000 IDs per hour. If we ever need to increase this the change would be as simple as increasing the length in our ID generator and updating our database schema to accept the new size. Note PlanetScale makes deploying database schema changes a breeze with branching deploy requests and a Gitlike development workflow. Generating NanoIDs in Rails Our API is a Ruby on Rails application. For all publicfacing models we have added a publicid column to our database. We still use standard autoincrementing BigInts for our primary key. The publicid is only used as an external identifier. Example schema We add the publicid column as well as a unique constraint to protect from duplicates. CREATE TABLE user id bigint NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT publicid varchar12 DEFAULT NULL name varchar255 NOT NULL createdat datetime6 NOT NULL updatedat datetime6 NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY id UNIQUE KEY idxpublicid publicid ENGINEInnoDB DEFAULT CHARSETutf8mb4 COLLATEutf8mb40900aici Auto generating IDs We built a concern that could be shared across all our models to autogenerate IDs for us. In Rails a concern is a shared module that can be shared across models to reduce duplication. Whenever our application creates a new record this code runs and generates the ID for us. appmodelsuser. rb class User ApplicationRecord For each model with a public id we include the generator include PublicIdGenerator end Here is the generator that creates the ID and handles retries in the small chance of a duplicate. appmodelsconcernspublicidgenerator. rb require nanoid module PublicIdGenerator extend ActiveSupportConcern included do beforecreate setpublicid end PUBLICIDALPHABET 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz PUBLICIDLENGTH 12 MAXRETRY 1000 PUBLICIDREGEX PUBLICIDALPHABETPUBLICIDLENGTHz classmethods do def generatenanoidalphabet PUBLICIDALPHABET size PUBLICIDLENGTH Nanoid. generatesize size alphabet alphabet end end Generates a random string for us as the public ID. def setpublicid return if publicid. present MAXRETRY. times do self. publicid generatepublicid return unless self. class. wherepublicid publicid. exists end raise Failed to generate a unique public id after MAXRETRY attempts end def generatepublicid self. class. generatenanoidalphabet PUBLICIDALPHABET end end Generating NanoIDs in Go NanoID generators are available in many languages. At PlanetScale we also have a backend service in Go that needs to generate public IDs as well. Here is how we do it in Go Package publicid provides public ID values in the same format as PlanetScales Rails application. package publicid import strings nanoid github. commatoousgonanoidv2 github. compkgerrors Fixed nanoid parameters used in the Rails application. const alphabet 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz length 12 New generates a unique public ID. func New string error return nanoid.

Errorfs cannot be blank fieldName if lenid length return errors. Errorfs should be d characters long fieldName length if strings. Trimid alphabet return errors. Errorfs has invalid characters fieldName return nil Wrap up Creating a great developer experience is one of our big priorities at PlanetScale. These seemingly small details like being able to quickly copy an ID all add up. NanoIDs were able to solve our application requirements without degrading developer experience.
"Seattle Schools Sue TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube Over Students' Mental Health","Seattle’s public school district is suing Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, and their parent companies.

The lawsuit filed on Friday in a U. S. District Court alleges that these social media sites have been a primary factor in a youth mental health crisis and that these platforms have knowingly exploited manipulated and targeted young people for profit at the expense of their mental heath. The district argues in its 91page complaint that tech giants have intentionally engineered addicting platforms cashed in on the vulnerability of stilldeveloping brains and algorithmically suggested harmful content to young users. Ultimately the school district is blaming these social media companies for the increase in mental health and behavioral issues that teens are showing up to classrooms with which has rendered the task of educating more difficult according to the suit. District officials point to a 30 increase in selfreported feelings of sadness and hopelessness among the student body as well as a rise in student suicide plans and attempts between 2010 and 2018. In an effort to manage those challenges the school district says it has had to take expensive actions like hiring more mental health counselors creating curriculum surrounding social media and mental health adjusting and enforcing school policies surrounding social media use and increasing disciplinary resources. However even all of these changes havent been enough to manage. Plaintiff cannot keep up with the increased need for mental health services because of the youth mental health crisis the lawsuit claims. So the Seattle schools are seeking accountability for social media platforms and meaningful change in how these companies operate along with damages and compensation. In past similar cases tech companies have used Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as a legal shield. Under the law digital publishers are not responsible for thirdparty content posted on their platforms i. e. Meta is not liable for anything its users post on Instagram and Facebook. However the Seattle case aims to get around this fundamental protection by targeting the design of social media sitesnot their content. The school district is claiming the increasing incentives to spend more and more time scrolling and the algorithms that dictate what users see causes harm toonot just whats in the posts. Defendants have maximized the time usersparticularly youthspend on their platforms by purposely designing refining and operating them to exploit the neurophysiology of the brains reward systems to keep users coming back coming back frequently and staying on the respective platforms for as long as possible says the complaint. Some psychology research along with both internal and external reports on social media company practices seem to support many of the new lawsuits claims. Studies have shown for instance that social media use and increased smartphone use may be linked to sleep depravation and accompanying depression. A Pew 2022 analysis found that more than half of teenagers surveyed would have a hard or very hard time giving up social media. Metas own internal research suggested that Instagram is toxic to some teen users particularly girls as it cultivates and amplifies body image issues. And Facebook has known for years that its algorithms boost time spent on its site to users detriment. However its very difficult to establish a direct link between increased social media use and worsened mental health because there are so many variables involved in mental health. And many experts dispute the use of the term addiction as applied to social media platforms altogether. This isnt the first attempt to sue social media companies for alleged mental health or youth harms in the U. S.. However past suits have mostly focused on individual cases. For instance the mother of a 10year old who died in 2021 sued ByteDance over allegations that a TikTok challenge caused her childs death. And in April the mother of a Wisconsin 17year old who died by suicide sued Meta and Snapchat for knowingly and purposely creating harmful and addicting products. The FTC has forced Fortnite to change its interface design so as to be less deceptive and fined Epic Games half a billion dollars. California legislators even tried to pass a bill banning addictive social media and explicitly making tech companies liable for every resulting violation involving children. The bill failed but more than 30 states currently have some sort of proposed or pending legislation aimed at regulating social media. Gizmodo reached out to Meta Instagram and Facebooks parent company Alphabet Google and Youtubes parent company TikTok owned by ByteDance Inc. and Snapchat owned by Snap Inc. for comment. We want teens to be safe online wrote Metas head of global safety Antigone Davis in a response statement emailed to Gizmodo. Davis statement cited tools the company has developed to support teen and families like age verifications parental controls and notifications encouraging breaks. Further it read we dont allow content that promotes suicide selfharm or eating disorders and of the content we remove or take action on we identify over 99 of it before its reported to us. Though past cases like the death of 14year old Molly Russell in the U. K. have demonstrated that harmful content like selfharm promotion does slip through the cracks. In the lead up to her suicide Russell interacted with more than 2000 Instagram posts relating to selfharm suicide and depression. A Google spokesperson too responded by highlighting the efforts he said the company has taken to make its platforms safer for children and teenslike screen time reminders and content blocks. TikTok and Snapchat did not immediately respond.

Through a Cast from their Pixel 6 Pro to a Chromecast Ultra the Reddit user found that when a song is beginning its album will remain front and center for a time before shifting off to the right side. In the empty center the songs artist and title will appear before giving way to the lyrics if available. The background of the Cast also appears to be a zoomedin version of the album the song is from. Since these are live lyrics the words will appear highlighted in white as the singer serenades you before scrolling to the following line. This is very similar to how the lyrics function on other popular music apps like Spotify. Its also been found that once the song finishes Google will display a list of credited songwriters. Also if there are no lyrics available to sing along with your Cast will simply show the albums art song title and the artists name in the center of the cast and not off to the side. The current testing of the live lyrics and the Casting UI redesign is not widely available unfortunately for any looking to take a gander. While this is a neat feature to see added to the casting feature of Android devices through YouTube Music it would be better if Google brought the live lyric feature to the mobile app. As it stands right now YouTube Music lyrics on your phone are static requiring you to scroll through them and hopefully not lose your way while singing. This still puts Spotify ahead of the Alphabetowned music streaming platform since these lyrics autoscroll and highlight for you right on your phone.
