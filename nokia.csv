The digital billboard urges Apple not to drop the ball on fixing its pixelated photos and videos. Hey Apple its Android the ball may have dropped on 2022 but you dont have to drop the ball on fixing your pixelated photos and videos. Heres some code to get the ball rolling... After the short message the billboard scrolls through RCS code ending with a plea to customers to Help Apple GetTheMessage the hashtag that Google has been using for the campaign. Google launched the Get the Message push back in August with a full website highlighting the benefits of RCS which include support for higher resolution photos and videos audio messages and bigger file sizes along with improved encryption crossplatform emoji reactions and more reliable group chats across different devices. Google continues into 2023 with more RCS ads targeted at Applehttpst. cofB6Mst1xXh Aaron aaronp613 January 5 2023 Google has been pestering Apple to adopt RCS for well over a year through the website pleas on Twitter billboards and more but Apple has made no acknowledgement of Googles efforts. In fact Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said that RCS is not a priority. I dont hear our users asking that we put a lot of energy in on that at this point said Cook. All major mobile carriers and manufacturers have implemented RCS support including ATT Verizon TMobile Motorola Nokia OnePlus Samsung Sony and others with Apple remaining the lone holdout.

In his speech opening the Consumer Electronics Show on Thursday John Deere Chief Executive John May laid out a strategy of using technology to feed a hungry world as arable land and rural labor decline while costs are rising. Technology allows farmers to create more with less May told an audience of 2000 at one of the worlds largest tech events organized by the Consumer Technology Association CTA. The trade group is partnering with the World Academy of Art and Science and the United Nations Trust Fund for Human Security to encourage the tech industry to help tackle the worlds most pressing problems. This is the next big idea said Walt Stinson cofounder of electronics retailer ListenUp who approached the CTA about a potential partnership. Several panels discussed how innovation helps to solve global challenges. Representatives of Nokia of America Corp ALUAL. UL Siemens AG SIEGn. DE and Alphabet Incs GOOGL. O Google talked about applying technology to help create a sustainable supply of food and closing the global education gap. Working to improve the human condition ultimately pays dividends said Ketan Patel a longtime Goldman Sachs banker who now runs the Force for Good Foundation. If you add to the purpose of every tech company all of a sudden you have a moral purpose you have something that could be hugely profitable Patel said because your technology reaches a customer base that previously was not profitable. The CES sessions are the first phase of the trade groups rolling thunder campaign to raise awareness across all sectors of the economy said Garry Jacobs executive chairman of the Human Security For All campaign. The group plans to make its pitch to the worlds universities in the coming months. These challenges cannot be handled by nation states or multilateral institutions said Jacobs.

Qatar’s forgotten migrant workers stuck in a ‘prison where you can work’,"In a world away from the glamour of Sunday’s World Cup final workers plough on, some still waiting to be paidIsaac* and Emmanuel* would have watched the World Cup final if they could have, but work came first. While Lionel Messi was rewriting history they mov…",2022-12-21T08:00:00Z,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/21/qatar-forgotten-migrant-workers-world-cup-2022,Isaac and Emmanuel would have watched the World Cup final if they could have but work came first. While Lionel Messi was rewriting history they moved through one of Qatars opulent shopping malls area by area fulfilling the cleaning tasks their employer had assigned. It was not too hard to glean what was going on and sometimes Isaac would try to make his old Nokia phone strain for updates. But football and especially football as inaccessible as this was really a remote concern. Walking past designer handbags perfumes and suits every day feels like a trudge through vacant empty space. The young Ghanaian men are in their third month here and are yet to be paid a penny. They told us they would pay this month but they told us that the previous times too says Isaac. I have no money. Im not happy at all. People tell you before you come here that its better and that with hard work you can get everything you want. But its just not like that. It is midevening and company buses have just dropped them off from another potentially fruitless shift. The daily return of Dohas migrant workers is a sight few visitors will have witnessed over the past month partly because some organisations were incentivised to keep their staff at home during the tournament in an attempt to ease congestion. For several hours from about 4pm vehicles chug along the gridded heavily polluted capillaries of the citys remote southwest and pour employees back into their labour camps en masse. It is a bleak unsettling scene the men deployed to keep an entire state running are being shuttled straight from one confinement into what is effectively another. We are in one such camp the precise whereabouts of which will remain undisclosed. It contains a small sports facility no more than a concrete basketball court with goals orientation becomes difficult after nightfall but Emmanuel and Isaac offer directions before entering one of the drab uniform threestorey blocks that occupy almost a square kilometre. The harsh glare of lights from atop each building makes fiveaside possible. Two players shudder into one another and land heavily on the rough surface. There is brief concern inquiries quickly offered in different languages but they are both fine. If you did not carry a certain toughness before arriving here it helps to learn quickly. You need it says Moses an articulate Ugandan who is taking his turn to watch from the side. In the end this is just a big prison where you can work. Nobody would be here if they had any other option and Qatar knows it. What we are seeing here is modern slavery. Moses works in security at a different mall he has risen to a position of greater responsibility and is embarrassed when teammates who double up as colleagues shout captain as they run past. He has seen what happens when things get too much. A friend was taken to the edge by the combination of long hours low pay sometimes unsanitary living conditions and extended time away from family that are facts of everyday life here. He was so traumatised that the only option was to send him to the bosses and insist they booked him a oneway flight home Moses says. He was fine when he came but Qatar changed him. Not everyone can endure it. The game carries on. Lusail Stadium is 20 miles away but this is really a different universe. A young Nepali wearing an Argentina shirt arrives to offer at least something in common scores laughs and leaves again soon after. Play will continue for hours more with a changing cast football after work or before it if you are on nights is the only physical outlet in the camp. There is not always time for it. Moses usually worked 12hour days before the World Cup essentially becoming 14 when travel was factored in with no extra payment. He tells of an event this year run by a major Qatari sporting organisation that demanded security staff work until the final guests had left. That meant finishing at about 2am every day returning to work on the 5am bus. Those who complained had their contracts terminated he says. You cant do anything against our bosses here. You can only go get up again and work the next day. During Qatar 2022 Mosess days were reduced to eight hours. The impact on his lifestyle and mental wellbeing has he says been marked. Well see whether or not it stays that way. Im sure things will change because of the World Cup and not in a positive way. I expect things to return to how they were before. A period of 29 days cannot change whats been happening for the last five or 10 years. Moses is like several others happy to share his experiences. Some are warier and others such as the Kenyan man sitting on a brokendown motorcycle five minutes from the pitch say they cannot trust anyone. But there is a consensus that while the focus diverts from Qatars glittering carnival of football the conversation around workers conditions must not end. Being forgotten is the worst thing that could happen to people such as Geoffrey a tall and deeply spoken Ghanaian who lives alongside eight compatriots in an apartment with a tiny common space and three singlesized bedrooms. Each holds a threetiered bunk bed and this is comfortable by labour camp standards both here and elsewhere. Geoffrey knows of equally small rooms housing five or six men. Illnesses run riot in such conditions in 2020 Amnesty International raised the alarm about the danger caused by Covid19 in the areas camps. Its important to remember us he says. When people get to know what we are going through here maybe bodies like the WHO or UN can help us. But the biggest thing for me is about the salaries its very tough. Each month Geoffrey who also cleans at a mall earns the minimum wage of 1000 riyals 225. It is barely enough to survive on even when an extra subsidy for accommodation and a small allowance for food are added when you are here to provide for your family. Social activities such as watching football in the fan zone intended for workers are off the agenda Geoffrey and his roommates were reduced to watching World Cup games on any phone that could stream them. He describes himself as lonely and bored and laughs when asked about daily life in general. Plenty is being held back. Qatar introduced the salary threshold last year but several workers who spoke with the Guardian said it was not always adhered to and that employees routinely pay scant attention to the governments reforms. Isaac whose example seems among the starkest elaborates. I dont mind Qatar as a country but a lot of companies are doing bad things and the government doesnt know he says. They dont pay you or they treat you badly. Thats the problem we are facing. Nowadays migrant workers can report abuses such as missed wage packets to the ministry of labour anonymously in theory but Isaac says he knows of cases where an employee has been paid after the governments intervention only to be identified by the company and dismissed. One of the most common sanctions mentioned to the Guardian is some companies habit of docking a worker two days salary for missing a days work which is not uncommon due to physical or mental fatigue. Isaac may put the onus on his managers but others are more critical of Qatar. A frequent theme is alleged racism displayed towards African workers. They tend not to mix with their Asian counterparts beyond work despite living in adjacent quarters and believe they are regarded differently by locals. Kwame who lives with Geoffrey and is a carpentry assistant for a construction firm describes the feeling of being treated as an underclass. What do Qataris give us he asks. Nothing. They treat us like we arent human like were pieces of shit. Kachara garbage they shout at us. The attitude is that we barely exist. Moses in several tales of everyday life patrolling his mall offers a similar impression. For a degree of balance he says some families bring him food from its restaurants and suggests bettertravelled locals behave more kindly. But the discrimination he sees in plain sight breeds a different worry he is obliged to live in an allmale environment and wonders what women working in household jobs in Qatar are subjected to behind closed doors. The overriding sense is that while Qatar has bragged wildly about the success of its tournament it has staged a show intended for anyone but the lowpaid migrants who have risked their wellbeing to keep it running smoothly. The World Cup wasnt for me Geoffrey says. It was about the Qataris not us. Were the labourers. It has made history for them they can always point to what happened. But they wanted to be famous and we were used for that. Football will have little meaning for Isaac until he has money to enjoy it in even the simplest way but he attempts a positive note. Its life he says. You just have to keep working hard. The bus will be waiting again in nine hours. Names have been changed to protect their identity.
How to drag and drop between apps on Android tablets,"The concept is simple, but the tablets and apps that support the feature are limited, so we'll break down what you need to know.",2022-12-24T20:00:55Z,https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/how-to-drag-and-drop-between-apps-on-android-tablets,How to drag and drop between apps on Android tablets Breaking down which Android tablets software and apps support the new feature. Google designed Android 12L to improve the quality of the Android tablet experience primarily by adding improved splitscreen UI so you can use multiple apps at once without needing an interface like Dex Mode. And one such 12L upgrade was its new draganddrop feature which lets you select a multimedia file from a Google Workspace app and move it into the other window without having to copy paste it. We dont really need to explain how to drag and drop files between apps on Android tablets in any depth because its so intuitive you simply tap and hold your finger or stylus on a file until a thumbnail appears then drag it across the display into the other compatible app and let go. If the conditions are right the image will paste over without any issues. So instead well focus on what software youll need which tablets support draganddrop and which apps support the feature. Which Android apps support drag and drop We cant provide a definitive list of draganddrop apps because technically any developer can enable the feature using the provided instructions from Android Developers opens in new tab. However it doesnt appear to be widely available and Google itself is still working to add the functionality to its own Google Workspace apps. At the moment Google Docs Drive Files Keep Photos Sheets and Slides all support the feature. We tested some native Samsung apps but were unable to make draganddrop work so the developer may or may not implement it in its own software. So at the moment assume that you can only use the feature in Google Workspace apps and use standard copyandpasting for other apps. Which Android tablets support draganddrop To successfully use draganddrop on Android tablets youll need to update to Android 12L or Android 13. This software enables multiwindow mode so you can easily open two or three splitscreen apps or multiple pinned apps. Older Android tablets running Android 12 or earlier do have splitscreening but you cant drag and drop between windows with the older UI. As for which Android tablets actually support 12L or later youll have the most luck with eligible Samsung tablets. The tablets below have progressed to One UI 5 based on Android 13 or One UI 4. 1. 1 based on Android 12L eligible tablets that havent received the update are marked with an asterisk Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 S8 S8 Ultra 13 Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 S7 S7 FE 13 Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 13 Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 12L S6 Lite 13 Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 13 Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3 13 Outside of Samsung your selection is fairly limited. The Lenovo Tab P12 Pro has Android 12L and some current and future Lenovo tablets like the Tab P11 Pro Gen 2 and Tab P11 Gen 2 will support the software in 2023. The Microsoft Surface Duo and Duo 2 also received 12L and the Nokia T20 should receive it at some point. If you own one of these compatible devices simply go to your Settings app and check to ensure youre running the latest OS software. If you want the best Android tablet experience your first and only choice should be the Galaxy Tab S8 series. It has cuttingedge performance bright and massive displays S Pens for lowlatency note taking quad Dolby Atmos speakers and battery life thatll last you days with light use.

Blackview BV7100 review: A cheap rugged phone for your unpredictable lifestyle,"The Blackview BV7100 is an unassuming rugged phone that does not try to impress consumers with a few gimmicks; instead, it does what it says on the tin.",2023-01-03T19:30:00Z,https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/blackview-bv7100-review,Android Central Verdict The Blackview BV7100 is a basic rugged smartphone that lacks the bells and whistles found in other Blackview models or rival brands. Rather than gimmicks the device has many of the basic capabilities youd expect from a rugged phone though you could find a better camera and a more powerful processor for a few dollars more. Pros Metal and rubber design Stunning battery life Water resistance capabilities Cons No 5G support No longterm software updates Bulky and weighty Camera is underwhelming Why you can trust Android Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. Ive extensively covered a lot of rugged phones in recent memory including Blackview models and Ive found most of them to tick almost all of the boxes if youre looking for smartphones that can endure a few knocks. The Blackview BV7100 which made its debut last September is no exception. In my experience Blackview usually edges out its rivals in terms of ruggedness and price. This makes it an excellent choice for those looking for a durable design without all the gimmicks offered by other brands like Ulefone. However if history is any guide rugged phones have poor Android OS implementations and software support so youd be wise to keep your expectations in check with Blackviews handsets. Sure my daily drivers are mostly Chinese phones from Vivo and Xiaomi but a device that can withstand a lot of abuse and survive water immersion provides some practicality for people who are clumsy with their hands. But if you live an adventurous lifestyle does the Blackview BV7100 fit the bill Continue reading to find out. Blackview BV7100 Price and availability The Blackview BV7100 is perhaps one of the most affordable rugged phones money can buy at present. On the companys own website opens in new tab it retails for 240. The company previously listed the phone at 300 before slashing its price big time. It ships to major international markets such as the United States Europe the United Kingdom and India. Blackview BV7100 What I like The Blackview BV7100 is a substantial piece of hardware weighing 460 grams. While this makes the device difficult to use for extended periods of time the phones rubberized metal construction allows it to withstand a beating. It has IP68IP69K ratings and is MILSTD810H compliant which means it can be thrown a few times submerged underwater and dropped from a stairwell without being severely scratched. Perhaps the best thing about the BV7100 is its insanely large battery. At 13000mAh the handset is not the easiest phone to kill in just one day. Although there are a few phones with larger batteries on the market like the Oukitel WP19 the 13000mAh unit on the BV7100 is a rare sight in this category. In my daytoday testing which consists of social media scrolling phototaking light games and several hours of internet browsing it averaged about 12 hours of screenon time. It also has an impressive standby battery performance with less than a 1 drain per hour on average. The phones endurance on the other hand is heavily influenced by how frequently and for what reason you use it. Of course increased active usage results in a shorter running time. I listened to 80 hours of music talked for 60 hours and watched 17 hours of video. The BV7100 charges at 33W which is a decent speed for a rugged phone. However it doesnt quite seem to be the perfect match for the phones massive battery. This means charging the phone may be the longest that youll need to sit through. In my experience I averaged 190 minutes juicing up the device from zero to 100. The upside is that you can use the phone to juice up other USBC devices thanks to its reverse wired charging capability. Its most useful when you find yourself in a place with no power supply. What sets the phone apart from many of the best rugged phones including those from Blackview is its plain simplicity devoid of any gimmick Ive seen in the Blackview BL8800 Pro for example. That phone includes a FLIR thermal imaging system as its main selling point. On the other hand the BV7100 shuns anything flashy or gimmicky instead opting for a highly predictable design that works like what it says on the tin. The screen also has a decent saturation with its brightness set to 50. Blackview did not specify which screen protection system is used but I havent noticed any major scratches on it yet and the preinstalled screen protector provides additional protection against scuffs. The frame also does a great job of resisting impacts. While this wont be my daily driver under normal circumstances who knows maybe Ill go camping for a few days in the mountains soon Id say this is an ideal device for those doing industrial jobs. Blackview BV7100 What I dont like At a glance the Blackview BV7100 doesnt seem to have a lot of downsides especially when you factor in the price but there are still a few drawbacks. While the phones large size gives it the appearance of durability it is far too heavy for daily use. Because of its weight the phone may be uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time. Thats to be expected for a phone in this segment though it remains a consideration if you like a rugged phone with a more svelte design. If youre used to typical thin slabs of a phone the Blackview BV7100 may feel immensely bulky especially if you use it for several hours or even a whole day. Despite the phones advertised 90Hz screen refresh rate I noticed some noticeable lag and lack of smoothness when moving around the UI. I initially assumed the display was locked to 60Hz but this was not the case. It turns out that the phones display is set to 90Hz by default and theres no way to change it in the settings menu. Another letdown is the phones limited mobile communications support. It is only capable of 4G and LTE with no 5G capabilities. Its not entirely surprising since many rugged phones seem to be following the same path when it comes to connectivity except for a few models like the Blackview BL8800 Pro. The cameras are also not the phones strong suit. While you can still get decent shots depending on what youre shooting and the lighting conditions its 12MP main sensor is fairly mediocre limiting its potential. One notable limitation is the lack of support for 2K or 4K video recording. Only a 1080p video capture resolution is available with the BV7100. Blackview BV7100 sample shots In terms of photography its 12MP Sony IMX362 sensor does the job but nothing spectacular. My night shots were mostly ruined by grainy results especially in lowlight conditions and the small sensor size appears to be the culprit. Like many rugged phones money can buy the phones camera app doesnt have special shooting features. Blackview BV7100 Competition For 240 the Blackview BV7100 offers a great value proposition compared to many expensive competitors like the Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro 499. Because of its low price its hard to find a true competitor to the phone in this price range. The BV7100s biggest rival comes from the slightly more expensive Doogee S89 Pro 360 and if you prefer a more slender rugged handset the Nokia XR20. If you prefer something from Blackviews own portfolio theres the BL8800 Pro though it offers a smaller battery. That said it remains an excellent budget rugged phone with a slightly higher price tag and for those that want it a FLIR thermal camera. You may also find the Blackview BV8800 a more appealing alternative with its more decent camera system and it starts from 249. The only big downside with the BV7100 is its sheer size and bulkiness but this shouldnt be a major dealbreaker for most buyers. As a result the phone packs a lot of punch into a small package making it a favorite among rugged phone enthusiasts. Blackview BV7100 Should you buy it You should buy it if... You like a phone that can withstand a few knocks and water immersion Battery life matters a lot to you You dont want to spend more than 300 on a device You should not buy it if... You need a phone with 5G support You want longterm software support for your handset Camera performance is critical to you Affordabilitywise nothing beats the Blackview BV7100. But it is the same factor that forced the company to cut many corners in terms of performance and camera skills so youd be wise to temper your expectations with this phone. Nonetheless for consumers who frequently need a device that can keep running for extended periods away from a charger or power outlet this handset is an ideal companion. It is also dust and waterresistant up to 1. 5 meters for 30 minutes so you wont have to worry if you drop it in the water by accident. The best bang for the buck The Blackview BV7100 is a plainlooking rugged phone that doesnt try to impress customers with a few gimmicks instead it possesses the basic features a rugged phone should have including a sturdy design and longlasting battery life.

The history of cell phones: A decade-by-decade timeline,"The first phone went on sale for nearly $4,000 in 1983. Here's a brief history of the cell phone industry and how it has evolved over time.",2023-01-09T04:16:58Z,https://www.androidauthority.com/history-of-cell-phones-timeline-3264425/,Links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. The history of cell phones A decadebydecade timeline In just a few decades mobile phones have gone from being a luxury reserved for the elite to an essential tool for billions of users. From the first incar phones of the 1940s to the best smartphones of today the evolution of cell phones is nothing short of remarkable. To that end lets take a look at the history of cell phones. Well go through the evolution one decade at a time from the firstever wireless network to the proliferation of mobile apps its all here. Early portable phones Pre1970s cell phone history The modern cell phone owes its existence to automobiles and trains two industries that adopted wireless communication nearly a century ago. In the 1920s German company Zugtelephonie AG developed and sold wireless telephony equipment to train operators. A couple of years later the service was offered to firstclass travelers on the route between Hamburg and Berlin. Then during the Second World War the Allied powers deployed over 130000 units of the SCR536 HandieTalkie pictured above. This bulky contraption was essentially an entirely handheld twoway radio transceiver. As youd expect from such an early technology it suffered from many drawbacks including short battery life and a pretty lackluster range of just one mile depending on the terrain. Still it was more than useable and the company behind it would eventually become the Motorola we know today. The modern cell phone has its roots in the Second World War. After the war ended American company Bell Labs began working on an incar system that would allow users to place calls from anywhere. This led to the launch of the Mobile Telephone Service MTS in 1946 or the firstever wireless telephony system. Bell Labs car phone equipment weighed 80 pounds in its first generation. And even with all that weight you could only use it in major US cities and along select highways. Despite these limitations the service quickly gained popularity. In fact it got so popular that the service quickly reached its maximum capacity due to the limited number of radio channels available at each base station. Users would simply have to wait in line for a channel to become available. Car phones became increasingly popular in the 1950s and 1960s among businesses and wealthy individuals. But its high cost meant that it remained out of reach for most people. The 1970s and 1980s The first mobile phone After decades of research and development Motorola unveiled a prototype of the worlds first cell phone in 1973. Martin Cooper the Motorola engineer who led the development of this invention invited reporters to witness the firstever wireless phone call. He then proceeded to ring his direct rival Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs from the streets of New York City. Motorola took a decade and 100 million to develop the first cell phone. However Motorola wasnt ready to put cell phones in their customers pockets just yet. It would take a full decade and over 100 million in development costs to come up with a final version. In 1983 Motorola would finally go to market with the DynaTAC 8000X. The phone was nearly a foot long and weighed roughly 2. 5 pounds over a kilogram. Still anyone could buy one and that was revolutionary enough at the time. And despite its eyewatering 4000 asking price Motorola reportedly couldnt manufacture enough units to keep up with demand. The DynaTAC 8000X used a brandnew cellular network specifically Bell Labs Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS. These days we refer to AMPS as a firstgeneration cellular network 1G or the precursor to 2G. As a purely analog network AMPS was susceptible to signal noise and static. It didnt support text messaging or SMS either. The DynaTAC 8000X could store 30 contacts but offered little else in the way of features otherwise. It didnt take long for more companies to follow in Motorolas footsteps. Nokia for example entered the cell phone market in 1987 with the Mobira Cityman 900. With its 1. 6 lbs 760g weight the phone represented a significant upgrade over the DynaTAC. Another year later Samsung released its firstever cell phone in 1988 with the SH100. See also Heres what the firstever Samsung phone looked like The birth of 2G and GSM The 1990s marked a time of rapid change in the cell phone industry particularly with the release of smaller and more portable devices. But arguably the most important development of this decade was the Global System for Mobile communications GSM the first fully digital cellular standard. In 1991 GSMs efficiency was perceived as a necessary advancement as the existing analog network was rapidly approaching maximum capacity. These days we refer to GSM and CDMA as secondgeneration cellular networks or simply 2G. See also Whats the difference between GSM and CDMA GSM didnt just improve call quality it also paved the way for text messaging and would eventually bring the internet to mobile phones. It also used encryption by default meaning that you could finally have a conversation without the fear of being eavesdropped on. Finally worldwide GSM adoption meant that users could simply swap SIM cards to switch between carriers. Related A recounting of the worlds first 2GGSM phone call The 1990s SMS and the worlds first smartphone Even though SMS was built into the GSM standard it would take another couple of years before Nokia would release the worlds first phone capable of composing a text message. Released in 1994 the Nokia 2010 featured a numeric keypad with letter mappings for text input. This became the standard layout for cell phone keypads until the arrival of full QWERTY keyboards and touchscreens. As Finnish company Nokia made a name for itself other electronics giants like IBM and Ericsson began to test the waters as well. In 1994 IBM partnered with wireless carrier BellSouth now merged with ATT to sell the Simon the first phone to also function as a touchscreen PDA. The Simon had a vast feature set for its time including an address book calendar and notepad. It could also send and receive emails and fax messages. In the couple of years that followed handset makers began experimenting with various form factors. The Nokia 8110 for example earned the banana phone nickname due to its prominent curvature and sliding form factor. It even made an appearance in the 1999 blockbuster The Matrix. Motorola meanwhile released the firstever clamshellstyle flip phone in 1996. The StarTACs top half folded down to protect the display and keypad. However Motorolas big selling point for the device was its impressive 3oz 88g weight. Towards the end of the 20th century we also got a glimpse at the future potential of cell phones with the BlackBerry 850. The device featured a 32bit Intel processor full horizontal keyboard and even included encrypted email software all for just 400. The company behind BlackBerry Research in Motion would go on to dominate the enterprise cell phone market over the next decade. Early 2000s A turning point in cell phone history While the 2000s started off with carriers like DoCoMo in Japan testing 3G cellular service the system wouldnt catch on for a while. Cell phone manufacturers meanwhile found themselves amid an intense race to innovate and outperform the competition. The decade saw the rise of fullcolor LCD displays and multimedia features like audio playback. Phones could also access the internet at faster speeds via the GSMbased General Packet Radio Service GPRS. Sony and Ericsson made the first phone to include Bluetooth connectivity as early as 2001. Related A little history of Bluetooth The Sharp JSH04 meanwhile became the first cell phone to feature a camera. Launched in the year 2000 the phone was sold exclusively in Japan. Two years later Sanyo and Sprint teamed up to release the first camera phone in the US. The SCP5300 featured a 0. 3megapixel camera along with a color display and a clamshell form factor. At 400 it was reasonably priced and almost universally praised. The early 2000s saw the arrival of cameras and fashionable designs to mainstream cell phones. The next few years saw device makers experimenting with form factors yet again. Nokia unveiled its infamous GameBoylike NGage and BlackBerry brought QWERTY keyboards to the mainstream with the Quark series. See also 5 iconic Nokia phones we wish would make a comeback And for the first time in the history of cell phones designs started to resemble fashion accessories rather than utilitarian tools. The Motorola Razr V3 was perhaps the perfect embodiment of this trend with its magnesiumaluminum build and unbelievably sleek profile. It went on to become the bestselling clamshell phone of all time. According to many estimates Motorola sold well over 100 million units of the Razr V3 in the four years between 2004 and 2008. The early 2000s witnessed a market share split between Symbian Palm OS and Windows Mobile operating systems. These platforms rapidly gained key features like PDF rendering video conferencing copypaste and even support for thirdparty apps paving the way for fullfledged smartphones. The late 2000s The first iPhone and Android 1. 0 Competition in the cell phone market began heating up in the latter half of the 2000s. And despite a looming recession consumer demand remained high worldwide. In 2007 Apple entered the cell phone market with the iPhone. The companys announcement described it as a revolutionary mobile phone a widescreen iPod with touch controls and a breakthrough Internet communications device. Indeed it was the first phone to fully embrace the touch interface and fulfill three use cases in a single device. Related The history of the iPhone and why it was such a big deal While touchscreen phones already existed at the time the iPhone didnt need a stylus and used cuttingedge capacitive hardware instead. Apples clever software innovations like multitouch were an added bonus. The iPhones large display also enabled browsing the internet on a relatively compact device for the very first time. Likewise it was the first cell phone in history to include dedicated apps for YouTube and Google Maps. The iPhone revolutionized the cell phone industry overnight. Apple introduced the App Store in 2008 unlocking new functionality through thirdparty apps. It ended up being a wildly successful move. Facebook one of the most popular apps on the digital storefront at the time gained over a million downloads before the year ended. The iPhones success singlehandedly popularized the notion of modernday smartphones. In fact it prompted Google to rethink its strategy with Android the mobile operating system it was developing behind closed doors at the time. When Android debuted on the HTC G1 in 2008 Google made sure it included a large touchscreen a fullyfeatured web browser and the Android Market app store. The rest is history. See also The complete history of Google smartphones The early 2010s iPhone and Android take over The early 2010s marked a period of consolidation in the cell phone industry. Consumers demanded a featurerich software experience that matched the iPhone but not every player could deliver. Symbian BlackBerry OS and Windows Mobile all received major overhauls. However they simply couldnt keep up with the rich app ecosystems of Apples iOS and Googles Android. Read more The rise and fall of Androids biggest competitors As for design trends physical buttons on cell phones were clearly on the way out even as early as 2010. The Samsung Galaxy S for example switched to capacitive touch buttons on the front leaving just a single physical home button. Only a few years later phones would feature edgetoedge displays with no frontfacing buttons whatsoever. Cellular data speeds improved considerably in this decade thanks to the widespread adoption of 4G LTE. The first Android phone to feature 4G connectivity was the HTC Evo all the way back in 2010. Apple would later bring LTE to the iPhone 5 in 2012. The early 2010s marked a period of consolidation around a select few hardware and software choices. Around this time the industry witnessed a big push toward improving camera quality. The Nokia 808 PureView blew the competition away with its large 41megapixel camera sensor. Similarly the Lumia 920 became the first phone to include optical image stabilization OIS. And in 2018 Huawei introduced the worlds first triplecamera phone the P20 Pro. The 2010s also introduced some lesserknown hardware firsts like Near Field Communication NFC eSIM support and water resistance or IP ratings. Samsung even brought heart rate and blood oxygen saturation sensors to its Galaxy S series smartphones. Qi wireless charging gained momentum after 2012 too with Nokia being the first to adopt it in the Lumia 920. Related The best phones with wireless charging available Late 2010s and early 2020s The future of smartphones The late 2010s finally catapulted the cell phone market beyond lowresolution camera sensors. Handset manufacturers like Google and Huawei also began to combine large camera sensors with cuttingedge software. The result Smartphone cameras yielded images that rivaled dedicated pointandshoot cameras despite the latter having more capable hardware. It didnt take long for other handset makers to catch up. Today virtually every single smartphone on the market relies on computational photography albeit to a varying degree. See also What is computational photography This period also marked the rise of the foldable form factor. Technically the Royole FlexPai holds the record as the firstever folding phone. However it wasnt until the Motorola Razr and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold launched in 2019 that the market actually took off in earnest. Setting aside the new foldable form factor and camera improvements it may seem as if cell phone advancement has slowed down in the 2020s. However theres still a lot to look forward to as handset makers experiment with underdisplay cameras magnetic accessories and machine learningbased software features. And if that isnt enough the latest iPhone can directly communicate with satellites in space marking a new chapter in cell phone connectivity.
Moto G Play (2023) review: no fun here,"The Moto G Play (2023) is Motorola's first new phone of the year, costing just $170. Is it the new budget champ, or does it make too many sacrifices?",2023-01-12T14:00:27Z,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/moto-g-play-2023-review/,The most impressive thing about the Moto G Play 2023 is its 170 price. But it becomes apparent very quickly how many corners Motorola cut to get there. Good build quality Decent main camera Very long battery life Uses a twoyearold processor Comes with Android 12 upgrades only to Android 13 No 5G NFC or wireless charging 10W fast charging speed Fingerprint sensor is awkwardly placed A lot of stuttering and frame rate drops Motorola is a brand name that has been around forever despite some restructuring a while back. In the preiPhone days Motorola was wellknown for its Razr flip phone and these days Motorola has a slew of Android smartphones in its catalog with several in the more affordable price range. The latest budget Android offering from Motorola is the Moto G Play 2023. Though the low price of 170 is mighty tempting your money would ultimately be better spent elsewhere. Heres why. Moto G Play 2023 design The Moto G Play 2023 has a simple and clean design with curved edges similar to what Apple did a few years ago with the iPhone 11. The phone chassis seems to be made with a lightweight plastic material and the back is matte so its pretty fingerprintresistant. It also has a waterrepellent coating so you wont have to worry about using the device in the rain accidental spills or even when youre working out. But dont get waterrepellent confused with waterproof because it certainly isnt waterproof so dont submerge it in water On the back of the Moto G Play 2023 youll find a triplelens camera system 16MP main camera with macro vision and depth sensors as well as an indented circle with the Motorola M logo. This is where the fingerprint sensor is and while it feels like it works reliably I personally hate the placement of the sensor. For me its placed way too high as the device has a 6. 5inch display and since I have smaller petite hands getting to the fingerprint sensor is a bit of a reach for me. I would have much rather preferred the fingerprint sensor to be closer to the middle of the device. On the upperleft edge is the SIM card tray and the opposite edge has the volume buttons and the sleepwake button. There are textured ridges on the sleepwake button that make it easy to differentiate it from the volume buttons which I appreciate. Along the top of the device are a headphone jack and a microphone. The bottom is where youll find the other microphone USBC charging port and speaker. Overall the Moto G Play 2023 has a pretty basic design that isnt without flaws but thats to be expected from a phone at this price point. At the end of the day it works and gets the job done. Moto G Play 2023 screen The Moto G Play 2023 has a large 6. 5inch LCD display but it is only HD and capped at a 1600 x 720pixel resolution. Though thats disappointing if youve tried out a higherresolution display its not surprising for a phone this cheap. However a saving grace is the fact that you get a 90Hz refresh rate which actually beats even the 800 iPhone 14 which only has a 60Hz refresh rate. Theres a holepunch cutout at the top of the display that houses the frontfacing camera so at least you dont get a weird little dip or notch like on other devices. Along the bottom is a bit of a bezel which makes it easier to perform swipe gestures from the bottom. But it also serves as a constant reminder that this is not an edgetoedge display. Things look decent enough on the HD screen but I did notice that some graphics looked a little blurry and less than optimal. The 90Hz refresh rate means smooth scrolling on websites and apps as well as easy switching between multiple apps but I did notice a lot of stuttering and laggy frame rates Ill talk more about that in the next section. I wasnt expecting an amazing display like with my primary device the iPhone 14 Pro but even the OnePlus Nord N300 5G has a betterlooking display despite both having similar specs. Moto G Play 2023 performance and software The Moto G Play 2023 comes equipped with a MediaTek Helio G37 chip 3GB RAM and Android 12 out of the box. Its important to note that the Helio G37 came out in late 2020 so the Moto G Play 2023 is using a chip that is already over two years old. This hampers performance considerably as I found the device to be sluggish even with basic tasks and navigation. And as mentioned above I noticed a lot of stuttering and frame rate drops. The Moto G Play also takes a second or two to bring up things like the keyboard when I need to input something. You get Android 12 with the Moto G Play 2023 so its already a little outdated considering that Android 13 is the current Android OS available. The upside is that you get a mostly stock Android experience because there isnt much preinstalled bloatware except for the Moto and Motorola Notifications apps. But heres the kicker the Moto G Play 2023 will only get one major software upgrade to Android 13 and thats it. It will get bimonthly security updates for three years at least so you can make sure youre safe from whatever vulnerabilities may pop up over time. But even so a promise of one Android upgrade just doesnt cut it in 2023. The Galaxy A14 5G by comparison ships with Android 13 is promised two Android OS upgrades and will get four years of security updates. Also of note is that the Moto G Play 2023 does not have 5G connectivity so youll be limited to just 4GLTE speeds. There is also no NFC chip so you cant use things like Google Pay. You really only have about 18GB of space to use as you see fit. Yet another pain point is the storage situation. The Moto G Play 2023 only comes with 32GB of internal storage but you can expand it up to 512GB with a microSD card. Im not sure in what world 32GB of storage is deemed as plenty of space as way Motorola suggests in its reviewer guide but Android 12 takes up almost half of that already so you really only have about 18GB of space to use as you see fit. Even if you go the route of expandable storage youll still be using a phone where the internal storage is packed to the gills. That may not matter in the short term but as the weeks and months go on not having any breathing room is bound to cause additional slowdowns the more you use the G Play something it cant really afford. Moto G Play 2023 cameras The Moto G Play 2023 comes with what appears to be a triplelens camera system on the rear but in reality its just a single 16MP main camera that is assisted by two 2MP sensors for both macro images and depth sensing. For the frontfacing camera you only get a 5MP shooter. Since this is a phone that is geared toward those on a tight budget dont expect a superamazing camera. But for what its worth the Moto G Play 2023 takes decent photos at least in good lighting as with any camera. I did find that sometimes the colors looked a bit washedout compared to my iPhone 14 Pro and details definitely get lost as you zoom in. I do think that the Moto G Play 2023 captures skin tone more accurately however and portrait shots are pretty good for the price. I also like the fact that you can adjust the amount of blur in a portrait photo before you capture it. The default camera mode works all right for the cost of entry but if you want more control over the image then the Moto G Play 2023 also has a Pro camera mode builtin with additional tools like autofocus lock white balance ISO and more. The selfie camera though its very much a budget camera at only 5MP. Its hard to take a flattering selfie when you look blurry and washedout similar to when you use the builtin webcams on a MacBook. Its not good. If youre looking for a powerful camera system you wont really find it on the Moto G Play 2023. But if you must have this phone the pictures it can take are fine. Nothing mindblowing compared to the competition but in a pinch itll do. Moto G Play 2023 battery and charging Battery life on the Moto G Play 2023 is impressive because it comes with a 5000mAh battery inside. On a full charge you can get around three days worth of use before having to plug it back in again. My typical day of use involves checking Microsoft Teams and Outlook for work and a lot of various social media apps. With my usage the phones large battery will definitely last at least two full days before I feel like I should plug it back in again. Motorola includes both a power adapter and a USBC charging cable in the box. Battery life on the Moto G Play 2023 is impressive. But charging the Moto G Play 2023 is a pain. You see while it supports fast charging it is capped at 10watt speeds. With a 5000mAh capacity battery it will take a while to charge up the device if its dead. During my testing it took around twoandahalf hours to bring it from a 0 dead battery to 100. Of course charging speed slows down once the battery gets closer to 100 but this is important to note. If you have a dead battery dont expect to be able to charge it fast before you have to go somewhere this is one of those phones that youd best charge overnight. On top of that theres no wireless charging with the Moto G Play 2023. Moto G Play 2023 price and availability The Moto G Play 2023 only comes in one color which is a sleek navy blue. It costs only 170 unlocked and is available to purchase directly from Motorola as well as retailers like Amazon and Best Buy. If youre looking at the Moto G Play 2023 because of the price there are some other budget phone options that are worth a look. For just 230 you can grab a OnePlus Nord N300 which also has a 5000mAh battery but can fast charge at 33W and also has 5G. You also have a more uptodate chip a sleeker design and featurerich software with longer update support. Even though its superaffordable at 170 I simply cannot recommend the Moto G Play 2023. Another good option is the Nokia G50 5G. You get a 48MP camera more RAM and 128GB of storage for under 300. There is also the Nokia G20 for about the same price as the Moto G Play 2023 and it also has more RAM and storage a 48MP main camera and a 5050mAh battery. If Samsungs more your thing the Galaxy A14 5G also looks like a really strong option. In addition to better software support the A14 also gives you 5G connectivity an HD display with a 90Hz refresh rate a 5000 mAh battery a 50MP main camera and it can be yours for just 200. As you can see Motorola made the G Play 2023 dirt cheap but cut corners to do so. When you take a look at the other options that are available in the low and midrange price bracket the Moto G Play 2023 simply doesnt make sense. The Moto G Play 2023 makes too many sacrifices Even though its super affordable at 170 I simply cannot recommend the Moto G Play 2023. Its baffling for a phone to come out in 2023 with a chip that is already over two years old and it really does affect the overall performance of the phone. During my testing I found it frustrating with the constant lag stuttering and frame rate drops when doing simple tasks. Even though it has an HD LCD display with a 90Hz refresh rate that doesnt mean much when almost everything looks and feels choppy. I also dont understand how a phone can launch in 2023 with only 32GB of internal storage with almost half of that taken up by the operating system so you dont even get the full 32GB. Even the other budget phone I recently reviewed the OnePlus Nord N300 has 64GB of storage double what the Moto G Play 2023 offers and for just 50 more. And though I love having a large 5000mAh battery Im puzzled by the decision to have it only support up to 10W fast charging. Again the OnePlus Nord N300 also has the same size battery but it can support charging speeds of up to 33W. It even has 5G support which is also lacking on the G Play. Even as a cheap backup phone Id skip this one especially when you can just pick up a flip phone for less. The money you could use for the Moto G Play 2023 is better put toward something else like a OnePlus Nord N300 Nokia G20 or G50 and even the new Samsung Galaxy A14. Budget phones have gotten really good in recent years but unfortunately the Moto G Play 2023 isnt one of them.

Branding aside the hardware is really reliable and works great with HealthKit. Each model comes in white or black with Body also available in pastel sand. Withings Body 59 is great for simply capturing your weight plus body mass index and having it appear in Apples Health app Withings Body 99 captures weight and BMI in addition to body composition water muscle mass fat mass and bone mass Withings Body Cardio 149 includes everything from Body as well as heart rate readings Withings Body is my goto HealthKit scale solution and has been for years. The Health Mate app is great for viewing weight data on charts that can show information in different ways than Apples Health app. I never have to worry about weight data showing up in the Health app after weighing either. The cheaper Withings Body model is my suggestion for customers on a budget or who only care about weight and BMI logging. The pricier Withings Body Cardio adds a rechargeable battery for its premium price but the builtin heart rate detection is a tough sell in the age of Apple Watch. Withings also has a cellular smart scale on the way but consumers shouldnt pay much attention to this version thats geared more toward health professionals. The existing Bluetooth wifi scales are great for home use. Qardio If youre not impressed with the Withings options Qardio has an attractive but pricey alternative. QardioBase 2 149 captures weight body fat percentage and body mass index data for the Health app on iPhone. Its round design and clever display makes it look more modern than Withings as well. QardioBase 2 also features a builtin rechargeable battery that lasts 12 months between charges like Withings Body Cardio not consumable batteries that need to be replaced after 18 months like Withings Body and Body. I purchased one of these a few years back and had trouble with weight data appearing in the Health app but your experience may vary today. Budget Picks While I dont have experience with Eufy the brand has sub 40 smart scale. Eufy BodySense captures weight BMI body fat percentage bone mass muscle mass and other measurements that sync with the Apple Health.

"If your phone is sluggish after it has been snoozing, Wakelock Revamp may be for you!",Wakelock Revamp is a nifty app that can prevent your Android device from sleeping too deeply while on standby. This app has been helping me to overcome severe performance issues on my Nokia 3.4. Read more...,2022-12-31T08:04:01Z,https://www.neowin.net/news/if-your-phone-is-sluggish-after-it-has-been-snoozing-wakelock-revamp-may-be-for-you/,Its not a secret that I do not like my Nokia 3. 4 one bit. Its the laggiest phone Ive ever owned especially when I come to use it for the first time in an hour or so. A few days ago I put DreamLab back on my phone to help science and discovered when I woke up that the phone seemed a bit snappier than normal it was because the CPU had been active and the phone hadnt been going into a deep sleep to save juice. After a bit of Googling I discovered wakelocks which keep the CPU active. You can turn these wakelocks on using an app like Wakelock Revamp to keep the CPU active while the display is off when you go to use your phone it doesnt take ages to wake up but is instantly snappy and ready to roll. Before finding Wakelock Revamp I tried a pretty similar app but that one didnt offer a runonstart feature and enabling the wakelock each time seemed like it could get annoying. As such I moved to Wakelock Revamp which offers a runonstart option. With the wakelock in place it turns out the phone really isnt sluggish after all. 3 GB of RAM is a bit prohibitive when it comes to heavier apps but unlocking the phone and starting to use it is nice and quick now. One question youre likely wondering about is whether not allowing the CPU to go into a deep sleep is draining the battery. From my testing this doesnt seem to be the case. In the battery usage section of the settings I can see Phone idle and Wakelock v3 listed and both have drained 1 of the battery not too much when you compare it to the screen which has used 5 the mobile network standby which has used 3 and my primary web browser which is responsible for draining 2 of the battery. It has been nine hours since I unplugged my phone Im down to 75 and theres a predicted 1 day and 4 hours left until it hits empty. Its not clear how widespread the issue of severe lagging is after waking an Android phone up Ive personally not experienced it on other devices but many Nokia 3. 4 users have complained online about poor performance and the Wakelock Revamp app mentions the Galaxy Note 4 by name as having issues. If youre noticing any issues with your device I highly recommend this app to give your phone a bit of a boost. A few other things I like about this app are the absence of ads so it runs very well and it doesnt require you to mess with permissions or disable battery optimization. I cannot promise that it wont affect your devices battery life while you have it running but in my usage of the app it hasnt had a noticeable impact. If you want to download it just head over to the Google Play Store and hit the download button. It has had over 100000 downloads and has a rating of 4. 8 stars. It works on devices running Android 4. 1 and higher so itll likely be compatible with your device. Ive only had to enable the Processor wakelock but there are several other options too including WiFi scanonly WiFi high performance WiFi normal Screen dimmed Screen bright and Screen and Keyboard. Each of these options comes with a little description about what they do and if you want the app to run on start just go to the Settings cog and toggle the feature on. Please let us know in the comments about which device you have and whether it suffers from any lagging on wake up and whether youve been able to rectify the issue with Wakelock Revamp.

How secure are RISC-V chips?,Open source by itself doesn't guarantee security. It still comes down to the fundamentals of design.,2023-01-07T17:52:08Z,https://semiengineering.com/how-secure-are-risc-v-chips/,Open source by itself doesnt guarantee security. It still comes down to the fundamentals of design. When the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities were first uncovered in 2018 they heralded an industrywide shift in perspective regarding processor security. As the IBM XForce Threat Intelligence Index put it the following year 2018 ushered in a new era of hardware security challenges that forced enterprises and the security community to rethink the way they approach hardware security. RISCV is coming of age in that new era benefiting both from lessons learned in the past and from the broad range of contributions by its opensource community. For most attacks threat actors dont care which processor they might be targeting. If someones doing spear phishing it relies on you clicking on a URL said Rupert Baines Codasips chief marketing officer. It doesnt matter whether youre running an Intel processor or an Arm M2. If you click on that link youre vulnerable. And a lot of attacks are like that. But for more sophisticated attacks designed to exploit more subtle vulnerabilities the specifics of processor architecture can make a significant difference. As you get into things like side channel attacks and Spectre and Meltdown then the architecture and the implementation really really start mattering Baines said. This is where RISCV can bring some unique strengths to the table. Security through openness RISCVs open architecture allows it to be examined closely on an ongoing basis. Baines pointed to a 2017 Princeton University study that uncovered several bugs in the RISCV spec as an example. While some people suggested the findings were a sign of weakness in RISCV most others disagreed. Weve never been able to do this study for Intel or Arm he said. They might have the same vulnerability but because its proprietary we cant look at it. And if thats true RISCV is now more secure because someone did look at it and its been fixed. OpenHW Group president and CEO Rick OConnor said RISCV was similarly useful in response to the initial onset of sidechannel attacks. The original research papers around that work were published using RISCV architecture just because it was the only architecture that was open he said. So you could get your hands on it put it up on a hoist dismantle it figure out where the vulnerabilities were develop algorithms to prove your thesis and then attack the thing. That kind of openness OConnor said ultimately makes RISCV more secure. It seems maybe counterintuitive but the best way to build a secure platform is to make the entire design open and available to scrutiny in the public domain he said. There are no back doors or hidden channels and the entire community can work on securing it. Whats more RISCV offers a unique chance to do that from the beginning by design. We have this clean canvas said Crypto Quantique CEO Shahram Mossayebi. We can do things right build things right in a way that is more suitable to how the ecosystem is evolving. The end of security by obscurity Peter Laackmann distinguished engineer for the Connected Secure Systems CSS Division at Infineon said it all comes down to Kerckhoffss principle the idea that a system should remain secure even if attackers know everything about how it works. The age of security by obscurity is over Laackmann said. We are working toward transparent security where we explain how things are working rather than hiding them. Cycuity security application engineer Anders Nordstrom pointed to AES as a good example of that. Even if you know exactly how AES works you cant reverse engineer it and get the key out of the encrypted data. And thats the correct way of addressing security he said. Trying to hide something works until somebody finds it out. If the architecture and the security features are known and can be designed to be secure even when they are known then youve got a much stronger defense. Still Laackmann said its important to keep in mind that just because something is open source it hasnt necessarily been examined. Due diligence is still crucial. There are many software packages that are open source and everybody thinks somebody has looked inside it. But then it turns out that for 20 years nobody did and then the security fails. So even if you use open source you have to check it. To that end Nordstrom said verification is key particularly in an opensource ecosystem. Just because its open source and RISCV that doesnt mean that its ready to use he said. You have to be aware of what youre getting. If youre buying from Arm you are getting a black box but you have some confidence that it has gone through a lot of verification. The risks of open source Commercial ISAs have a significantly longer track record and that track record comes with innate benefits. Intel and Arm have had a lot more experience and theres a lot more buildup of techniques and solutions and architectures theyve got in there that the RISCV community hasnt yet built or standardized or rolled out Baines said. Newer opensource solutions can introduce other challenges as well. Nicole Fern senior security analyst at Riscure noted that including thirdparty IP in a design always requires effort and budget for integration and testing. But she said that effort is far greater when using opensource hardware especially opensource IP that lacks maturity compared to its closedsource version. For example Arm cores have been successfully integrated into SoCs and taped out for many years now. It will take some time before RISCV implementations reach the same level. Theres also a risk of threats being intentionally introduced. Because anyone can publish an opensource RISCV implementation there are more opportunities for bad actors to publish designs with known vulnerabilities or hardware Trojans Fern said. For opensource projects with multiple contributors there is opportunity for untrusted entities to try and push vulnerable patches or updates into otherwise trustworthy opensource projects. Improving security and reliability Still as competition grows security will steadily improve across the RISCV ecosystem. Baines said he expects the level of security required for automotive applications to become table stakes within the next 12 to 18 months. Not everyone wants to pay for the certification not everyone wants the legal guarantees but every company should be capable of delivering ISO 26262 safety and ISO 21434 security he noted. In fact if youre doing a vendor selection its worth ensuring that a company can deliver at that level regardless of whether thats something you actually need. I want to know that you as an organization have those capabilities have that understanding because that gives me confidence in the way you do all of your engineering Baines said. Its also crucial to catalog assets and do threat modeling to assess what needs to be protected. Once you understand whats important in your system you need to start writing security requirements Nordstrom said. These security requirements express This is my asset and this is how the information is kept secure. Whats needed for hardware security Nordstrom said is very similar to whats needed for any other aspect of verification. You need a plan and you need to make sure that you follow the plan. And then afterwards you know what you can claim and you know that youre as secure as you feel you need to be. Thats true for any system opensource or not. If you buy the processor or a system from somebody else ask them Okay show me what you did to verify that there are no hardware security vulnerabilities Nordstrom said. Building the ecosystem More broadly its in each companys own interest to support open standards and to work toward improved quality across the board. Bad quality poisons the well for everyone so if we can help purify the well for everybody thats good and that helps the RISCV ecosystem Baines said. It means theres more software developers it means there are more libraries it means there are more people using it and its a virtuous circle. To that end Baines said its important for more companies to support organizations like the OpenHW Group and RISCV International. One of the things that does worry me about RISCV is the potential for fragmentation he said. People are taking a RISCV architecture and developing RISCV cores and then adding their own proprietary stuff as well which de facto means its not an interoperable standard anymore. Think of mobile solutions which can only succeed through a shared focus on standards and interoperability. You can use an Apple phone with a Nokia base station or an Ericsson base station or a Samsung base station and Nokia Ericsson and Samsung all compete fiercely but they will all work with that same Apple phone Baines said. And I hope that RISCV goes in that same direction. The future of RISCV security Just patching up the security isnt sufficient for RISCV to succeed. But security will be a requirement if RISCV is to be used in more mainstream applications. Were not going to be able to deploy all of these smart and intelligent IoT edge connected devices which have all the benefits were talking about with AI and ML if you can trust my stuff but you cant trust your stuff OpenHWs OConnor said. As soon as theres this hierarchy of better security then as a collective were doing the communities that were trying to serve a disservice. The good news according to Riscures Fern is that RISCVs openness has the potential to lead to vastly improved security. There is a lot of opportunity to create implementations from the ground up with security properties such as increased tolerance against fault injection attacks and to integrate new ideas and techniques from the research community in a more agile manner compared to other closedsource commercial options she said. Part of the challenge lies in simply getting companies of all sizes to buy into the idea. Inside each company there are the groups who think opensource hardware as a concept is ready and its time to start figuring out how the workflows are going to function and what it means to collaborate in the public domain on opensource projects OConnor said But at the same time theres an equally strong and maybe even stronger contingent or camp that thinks this is total hogwash. The best way to respond to that contingent OConnor said is to let the work speak for itself. Implementations and existence proof go a long way for skeptical hardware engineering types he said. Fundamentally the industry is based on proving that your design works and then releasing it to production. As hardware engineers were trained to have existence proof before we say okay. And thats inevitably going to take time. Acorn and then Arm and even x86 for that matter none of these things happened overnight OConnor said. Relatively speaking the rollout of the RISCV architecture and the volume associated with these devices is actually moving pretty fast. Its not a one or twoquarter problem. Its years. Still Baines said for any company considering RISCV but unsure if the ecosystem is ready theres always going to be a reason to delay. If youve got an engineering project thats going to benefit from RISCV you should be looking at it now he said. Or you can wait two or three years and find out that your competitors have launched two generations of projects in that time. And what will that do to you Related RISCV Pushes Into The Mainstream Opensource processor cores are beginning to show up in heterogeneous SoCs and packages.

Most Read from Bloomberg What We Know About the Kraken Covid Variant XBB. 1. 5 and Why Its Causing Concern US and Germany to Send Ukraine Armored Vehicles in Major Arms Upgrade If You Have Student Loans Mark These Dates on Your Calendar Ukraine Latest US Germany Sending Armored Vehicles Patriots Why Conservatives Are Blocking McCarthy as Speaker and Throwing Congress Into Chaos The companys sales rose 7. 2 to 191 billion yuan 27. 4 billion in the December quarter according to Bloombergs calculations off annual figures after carving out new income streams from areas such as smart cars and cloud services. 2022 sales stood at 636. 9 billion yuan the Shenzhenbased company said up marginally from a year earlier. Huawei is trying to open up new markets and businesses after US tech export restrictions gutted its smartphone business briefly the worlds largest and curtailed the sale of advanced gear in developed markets. Among those trade restrictions is a ban on contract chipmakers producing semiconductors designed by Huawei effectively kneecapping its HiSilicon design business. Rotating Chairman Eric Xu warned in an annual new years message to employees of macroeconomic uncertainty in 2023 though he made no mention of Chinas abrupt reversal on Covid policy. That aboutface has spurred concerns about the fallout on economies from a subsequent surge in infections. But Xu said longerterm demand for technology remains intact. He didnt specify how the company might overcome export restrictions but Huawei has spent much of the past three years developing researching and sourcing alternatives to American components. In 2022 we successfully pulled ourselves out of crisis mode. US restrictions are now our new normal and were back to business as usual Xu said. The macro environment may be rife with uncertainty but what we can be certain about is that digitalization and decarbonization are the way forward and theyre where future opportunities lie. Huaweis also sought out alternative sources of income by selling patents technology services and wireless gear to new customers from automakers to coal mines and industrial parks. It began levying royalties from the worlds biggest smartphone brands including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. The Chinese company has signed more than 20 patent license agreements this year covering smartphones connected vehicles networking and the Internet of Things according to Alan Fan the companys global head of IP. Weve managed to keep our heads above the water because we fought together united as one Xu wrote. 2023 will be the first year that we return to business as usual with external restrictions still in place.

Here are 6 such picks that fall within the broad utility and telecom sector. Nancy Zambell Cabot Stock of the Month Just for fun I recently searched for stocks that had fallen 10 or more from their 52week highs thinking that some of them may have declined due to market factors that didnt reflect the companys potential. Unbelievably I came up with a total of 7015 stocks out of my database of 8377 stocks I narrowed my search again looking for companies with positive institutional transactions positive insider transactions and technical and analyst ratings of Strong Buy. The result 6 names which I then winnowed down to what I think is the best one for 2023. The company is a utility The York Water YORW Company YORW. York Water will be 207 years old in 2023the oldest water business in the U. S. The company was founded by local businessmen who were worried about fire protection. Although 71 of the Earths surface is covered in water only half a percent is drinkable. And with a global population of more than 8 billion and growing water is a hot commodity. York impounds purifies and distributes drinking water serving customers in the fixtures and furniture electrical machinery food products paper ordnance units textile products air conditioning systems laundry detergents barbells and motorcycle industries 51 municipalities within three counties in southcentral Pennsylvania. The company posted Q3 EPS of 0. 40 topping analysts estimates by 0. 02. Revenue rose 9 to 15. 81 million also beating analysts estimates by 0. 81 million. In the last four quarters York Water has met analysts earnings estimates once and beaten them the remaining three periods. Institutions own abut 48 of the outstanding shares of York Water and hedge funds have recently increased their ownership of the stock. York pays a dividend yield of 1. 79 and the company has the longest record of consecutive dividends since 1816. For a steady company with an essential product growing earnings and a consistent dividend York Water should be on your shopping list for 2023. Uncertainty is plentiful in todays financial world as investors try to sort out a reasonably strong economy historically high inflation war in Ukraine and aggressive Federal Reserve monetary policy. Unfortunately the increased uncertainty has resulted in abovenormal volatility in the stock and bond markets this year. Price pressure on mutual funds and ETFs of almost every type has necessitated a close review of all our positions. We have identified an opportunity among our Specialty holdings to help improve performance going forward. For conservative investors or those looking for a conservative sleeve we are establishing a position in utilities. Utilities funds are used as a defensive investment providing a combination of capital appreciation and dividend yield with a lesser risk profile than a typical growth or value domestic stock fund. Dividends from utility companies often outyield other fixedincome investments and utilities tend to be very resistant to economic cycles. This is because demand for utilities does not change much compared with most other industries even in economic hard times. We sold some of our balanced fund positions in all three of our Conservative model portfolios to fund the Utility position. Removing balanced funds makes some sense on its own merits as we can replicate those funds allocations with our own commitments to stock and bond funds. Fidelity Select Utilities FSUTX is considerably less risky than the market showing a beta of 0. 69 113022. This reflects the steady demand that we described above. Of course changes in government regulations fuel prices the cost of financing natural resource conservation and more could affect the attractiveness of the underlying stocks. The fund held approximately 72 in electric utilities as of October 31 the most recent data available. It held less than one percent in oil gas storage and transportation. Here are the top five holdings NextEra Energy Southern Company SO Constellation Energy Sempra Energy SRE and Exelon EXC Corp. EXC. Fidelity Select Utilities a large cap value fund has had a 2022 YTD return through 12722 of 5. 1. In comparison the Vanguard 500 Index ETF VOO Bruce Kaser Cabot Turnaround Letter Nokia NOK is one of the worlds primary providers of telecom equipment and is a Top Pick for conservative investors in the coming year. Based in Finland the company struggled with disappointing new product initiatives including mobile phones a lack of a major telecom upgrade cycle a wrongway bet on semiconductor technology and weak leadership. Its 15. 6 billion acquisition of AlcatelLucent in 2016 has been a disappointment as well. Current worries include the intensely competitive environment particularly in radio access networks a core component in telecom systems. Nokia shares have gone nowhere in the past ten years. New leadership however is refocusing and rebuilding Nokia. Pekka Lundmark helped develop Nokias business in the 1990s then gained valuable business and leadership experience from impressive roles at other major companies until rejoining Nokia as CEO in late 2020. Under Lundmark the company has corrected its semiconductor mistake reinvigorated its sales efforts streamlined its profit structure and is investing heavily in new product development that is lifting its market share trajectory. These improvements are showing up in the companys financial results. Sales growth hit 6 excurrency and earnings per share rose 25 in the most recent quarter. The operating profit margin dipped but this was due to a timing issue with high margin patent contracts. Nokia remains ontrack to maintain and build upon its alreadyimproved margins even as it ramps up its technology spending. Global telecom service providers continue to ramp their spending for the rollout of 5G technology. India has been widely cited as a large and upcoming new market. Due to security concerns Chinas Huawei is being sidelined leaving more market share opportunities for western companies like Nokia. While the industry is highly competitive Nokia is increasingly capable of maintaining its position at a minimum. Free cash flow is strong allowing the company to now hold 4. 7 billion in cash above its debt balance. With its new financial flexibility Nokia has restored its dividend and is about halfway through its 600 million share repurchase program. The share valuation at 4. 8x estimated 2023 EBITDA is unchallenging. Allin this underappreciated company offers an attractive turnaround opportunity for 2023. Prakash Kolli Dividend Power Verizon Communications Today Verizon is one of the three largest American telecommunications companies. Verizon has about 120 million wireless connections including 91 million postpaid four million prepaid customers and around 25 million data devices. In addition Verizon has about 6. 7 million FiOS and other connections. The company also has approximately 25 million fixedline telecom connections. The company sold its AOL and Yahoo businesses in 2021. Total revenue was around 133613 million in the fiscal year 2021 and about 135651 million in the last twelve months. One of the main issues affecting retail cellular subscriber growth is slow data speeds. The company offers 5G but the speeds are slower than those offered by TMobile TMUS or ATT T. In addition ATT has divested its content offering and is more focused on providing services. Additional competition is present from cable companies offering cellular service. Another risk is that Verizons balance sheet debt grew because of Cband spectrum purchases. That said debt is trending down. The firm has 2082 million in total cash and shortterm investments 14995 million in current debt and 132912 in longterm debt. The credit rating agencies give Verizon a BBBBaa1 lowermedium investment grade rating. Although Verizon has nearterm challenges longterm it is positioned for growth. The company is rolling out its 5G offerings including the faster mmWave technology called the 5G Ultra Wideband and the Cband. This should speed up data downloads and uploads and expand geographic coverage to better match its two primary competitors reversing subscriber losses. In the time being Verizon sports a 7 dividend yield backed by a relatively conservative payout ratio of approximately 47. In addition Verizon is a Dividend Contender having raised the dividend for 18 consecutive years. Verizon is a deal now. It is valued at a PE ratio of 7. 2X compared to a range of about 12X to 15X in the past decade. As a result investors are getting an undervalued stock a yield almost at a decade high and consistent dividend growth. Roger Conrad Conrads Utility Investor Dominion Energy D a Top Pick for conservative investors raised the midpoint of projected 2022 earnings after reporting Q3 at the top end of its guidance range. However the announcement of a top to bottom strategic review of the business and withdrawal of longterm earnings guidance understandably spooked investors. Memories of the abrupt 2020 sale of its midstream energy business and onethird reduction in the dividend are still fresh. And the result was a mass shift of Wall Street recommendations from buy to hold with the share price plunging by more than 20 percent year to date including dividends paid. In this case however the most likely outcome is asset sales that actually unlock shareholder value. The three most likely candidates are Dominions remaining 50 percent stake in the Cove Point LNG export terminal in Maryland the unregulated Millstone nuclear plant in Connecticut and the renewable natural gas development assets. All have gained considerable MA value because of rising natural gas priced. So selling proceeds should enable considerable reduction of debt. But together they account for less than 10 percent of Dominions earnings meaning dividends will remain comfortably funded even before interest cost savings from debt reduction and rate base growth from elevated utility CAPEX. I dont expect the stock make much headway until the company resets its longterm earnings growth guidance not likely before Q4 earnings in early February. But the discounted valuation and yield of just under 5 percent are pricing in very low expectations that wont be hard to beat. Buy at 65 or less. Meanwhile owning ATT Inc T a Top Pick for aggressive investors has been an exercise in patience since the retirement of visionary CEO Ed Whitacre. The current CEO John Stankey and his team have been returning ATT to its telecom roots. They started with some tough medicine Halving the dividend and completing the disappointing spinoff of Warner Brothers Discovery WBD followed by two successive first half reductions in 2022 earnings guidance. But now investors have reason to be hopeful again. Management raised the midpoint of its 2022 earnings guidance range following strong Q3 earnings. It affirmed its 14 billion free cash flow target for the year a level that would cover dividends with 4 billion plus to spare. And despite inflation pressures and tough competition the company expects to do much better in 2023 projecting 17 billion in free cash flow. I expect 5G to ultimately become a more robust driver of growth for ATT and its primary rivals TMobile US TMUS and Verizon Communications VZ. The company already has over 100 million Internet of Things connections including one million automobiles. And its 5G and converged fiber broadband offerings continue to meet with success. My expectation is ATT will surprise investors with a low to midsingle digit percentage dividend increase next year. But even the current yield of nearly 6 percent is attractive. And at just 7. 7 times expected next 12 months earnings investor expectations are quite low and therefore easy to beat. With risk of a recession and further stock market downside looming large it may be some months before ATT shares show meaningful gains. But Im comfortable rating the stock a buy for very patient value seekers at a price of 20 or lower.
