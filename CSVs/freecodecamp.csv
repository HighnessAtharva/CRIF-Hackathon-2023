0,How To Build A Professional Facebook Profile You Can Be Proud Of,How can you build a professional Facebook profile you can be proud of? Here's what everyone ought to know about creating professional Facebook presences.,https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-facebook-profile-like-professional-weekly-facebook-tips/,Facebook is the most popular social network by a long mile. While you might use it to connect with friends share a laugh or just scroll through the feed in your free time theres more you can do with it. If you are a professional who wants to work with others in the industry connecting with others is the best way to get started. So optimizing your Facebook profile in a sophisticated way could attract some interest from other professionals. While its not a jobhunting site you never know who you might end up talking to or working with. So here are some tips on building a professional Facebook profile. 1. Add a Professional Profile Picture and Header Whenever you like comment or post something on Facebook your profile picture is always visible. Its what makes the first impression so you want to choose the best Facebook profile picture possible. Theres no need to be in a suit just make sure that you dont look unprofessional. Your face should be clearly visible so avoid wearing sunglasses or a mask in the photo. The same is true for your cover photo or header. A good header should showcase your passion services or even hobbies related to your professional life. You could also add links to your professional profiles in the description of the header. 2. Make Your Bio Reflect Your Profession Whenever someone clicks on your profile the bio is likely the second thing theyll notice after your profile picture and header. So make sure that your bio accurately reflects you and your profession. You want to keep things simple rather than adding random quotes. However you can add a quote if it reflects you or your personality but dont add one just for the sake of it. The main focus should be on your profession so make sure your bio is clear and concise. Less is more in this case. 3. Update the About Section With Accurate Info Most people rarely update their About section for their profile. This section of your profile highlights where you are from where you are currently working and when you joined Facebook. You could also add your educational background and any websites that you run. A good rule of thumb is to add three important details then links to your website or other professional profile. Facebook added a new feature that also allows you to add hobbies but you would want to avoid that as that can add a lot of clutter to the About section. 4. Link to Your Other Professional Profiles Facebook is more of a casual site for most people as very few people are looking to hire someone from the site. So linking to your other professional profiles is a good idea to draw attention to those platforms. You can add these links in your About section for easier access. If you havent already create a portfolio website and add a link to that on your profile. You should definitely add a link to your LinkedIn profile as well and even Instagram if that is relevant to your profession. 5. Post WorkRelated Content If you have been on Facebook for a while you are likely used to posting and sharing stuff that is all over the place. This likely includes memes comics tweets and random threads. While theres nothing wrong with that it sends the wrong message if you want to appear as a professional. Instead posting workrelated content shows that you are passionate about your industry. If you are a designer share posts that focus on photography design elements and maybe even infographics. Similarly if you are a programmer try sharing posts from pages such as StackOverflow FreeCodeCamp etc. 6. Tweak Privacy Settings Anything you post on Facebook is usually available to see for Friendswhich means that only your friends can view the content you share. You can change this by tweaking your Facebook privacy settings. As for your professional profile youd ideally want everyone to see the professional content you share. This practice would tell your prospects that youre not only a professional who keeps their profile updated but also someone who has an impact and a following. If you have content you only want your friends to see you can set the audience to Friends from the Audience button when youre sharing a post. 7. Review Posts That You Are Tagged In Getting tagged in random posts can be quite annoying. Whats worse is the fact that when you are tagged in a post it appears on your profile and everyone can see it. Luckily Facebook added a setting that allows you to review posts you are tagged in before they show up on your profile. You can turn this on by going to Settings Privacy Settings Privacy Profile and Tagging. From here make sure the setting to Review posts you are tagged in is enabled. Once done every time youre tagged in a post Facebook will ask you if you want to be tagged in this post or not. Only the posts that you approve will appear on your timeline. 8. Review Old Posts Its also a good idea to review some of your old Facebook posts. People might end up skimming through your profile to see your interests and you dont want them to see something that will turn them away. So go through both your recent and old posts and delete anything that might push people away. You might also want to avoid posting political stuff for good measure. 9. Review Your Likes and Groups People that visit your profile can also see what pages you like and what groups you are a part of. Incorporate the same strategy here as you would for older posts. Unfollow any pages or groups that are controversial misleading or problematic. You can also set pages visibility from privacy settings so that only you can see the pages you follow. 10. Customize Profile URL A custom URL for your Facebook profile is more professional than any random username given by Facebook. To change your Facebook profiles URL From any Facebook page click your profile pictureand click Settings Privacy. Then from the panel on the left click Settings. Now youll be on the General Account Settingspage. Here click the Editbutton just beside the Usernamesection. Set your new username preferably your full name without any symbol and click Save Changes. Now when you visit your profile Facebook will show your name or set username in the URL box instead of the generic code which is hard to remember and unsightly. Make Your Online Presence Professional for Better Opportunities Most of the tips here are specific to Facebook but if youre on the hunt for better opportunities youll need to build professional profiles on other platforms as well. If youre on the hunt for new clients you should optimize your LinkedIn profile as well. Theres a lot more you can do to improve your chances of finding better work. You should build a strong portfolio connect with as many people as you can in your industry and try to create a professional email address while youre at it.,2022-12-31T13:05:15Z
