1,The Reign of the Part-Time Twitch Streamer,It’s almost impossible to earn a living on the streaming service. Maybe it’s time to stop trying.,2022-12-27T13:00:00Z,https://www.wired.com/story/twitch-streamer-hobby/,The camera focuses on two bare feet as a Twitch streamer who goes by JrocTheGod wrecks boss after boss in Cuphead with just his toes. After a few failed attempts to defeat the devilish final boss in addition to a few breaks to rest his feet JRoc rolls credits on Cuphead as members of his community drop a gg in the chat. Fulltime job or stream my own wellbeing is first says JRoc. Breaks are important to him. Despite working hard to cultivate an online community and earning recognition from the Amazonowned platform as a Twitch Ambassador JRoc is one of the thousands of dedicated streamers with day jobs. Reporting from WIREDs Will Bedingfield lays out how streamers with small audiences struggle to grow. Even those with a decent following struggle to make ends meet on the platform. If your immediate goal is to make a living as a creator then youre probably setting yourself up for disappointment. Be more realistic says Mike Minton a vice president of monetization at Twitch. Im not gonna sit here and say Yeah its easy to become a livestreamer and do that fulltime. Because the data doesnt support that says Minton. Its not an issue thats unique to Twitch. Only a small sliver of fulltime creators on social media earn a living wage across the industry. At TwitchCon in San Diego the platforms top earners expressed deep frustration as the company lowered how much some people make from subscriptions after receiving 100000 a year. Less popular streamers who attempt to sustain a career on Twitch encounter even more financial instability. Earlier in 2022 Valkyrae an influential creator who switched over from Twitch to YouTube discouraged a member of her community when asked for growth advice. Do not quit your job she said. Do streaming as a hobby. Far below Amouranth playing Just Dance and HasanAbi reacting to his Twitter feed live on Twitch a legion of unnoticed streamers desire more onplatform discoverability. Larger streamers are great but there are a lot of smaller streamers that are a lot of fun says Rose Evergreen who performed at TwitchCons drag showcase. Twitch keeps growing claims Tom Verrilli a chief product officer at Twitch. So the number of people that we have to help surface grows exponentially as well. The platform boomed at the start of the Covid19 pandemic. Many streamers broadcast to no one at all. Those who rely on streaming as a primary source of income often experience burnout. Sometimes they stop broadcasting altogether. I think the most rewarding aspect of streaming isnt the growth aspect. Particularly its about finding people says Mary Kish a director of community marketing at Twitch who streams in her free time. Twitch is incentivized to shift the communitys perspective about compensation at the platforms current pay rates. A person who considers streaming as their job may be devastated to get 800 a month from the platform. A hobbyist may be delighted to receive the same amount. Instead of trying to play whatever titles are trending on the platform like Apex Legends or Valorant several parttime creators successfully connect with likeminded people through distinctive broadcasts and peculiar game choices. My blueprint is my blueprint its not going to be yours says JRoc. Upgrade as you go. You dont need to be elite from the start he says. As tempting as it may be to recreate a PC battle station used by Twitch superstars topoftheline equipment is not at all necessary for someone whos a weekend warrior and broadcasts a couple times a month. What if your mailman was a Vtuber Or your teacher streamed Surgeon Simulator 2 after a long day of class The hobbyists are the future of Twitch. In lieu of incessant group messages from that one friend about a DJ set or yoga class expect to receive invites with links attached to watch their livestream. An interest in video games is not necessary. Your friends may cook a fancy dinner live or rant about their fantasy football draft. They might even pull you onto the digital stage.,Twitch says it fixed an issue that prevented people from watching streams,Extremely Negative,290,"['issue', 'complaints', 'issues', 'issue', 'issue', 'issues', 'issue', 'unclear', 'issues', 'Discord']",[],[]

B. S. D Crown Ltd formerly known as Emblaze Ltd accused Amazon and Twitch of violating its rights in a patent related to adjusting the quality of livestreaming audio and video based on changing bandwidth availability. Emblaze previously sued Apple and Microsoft in the U. S. for infringing the patent. A California jury ruled for Apple in 2014 and Emblaze and Microsoft agreed to drop their dispute in 2015. BSDs attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday and a representative for Amazon declined to comment. BSD said in the lawsuit that Emblaze was founded in 1994 and innovated streaming technology that now powers the majority of live broadcasts. BSD said Amazon infringes the patent with its technology for adapting video quality in live sports streams such as National Football League games as well as in Twitch live streams. Amazon bought Twitch for 970 million in 2014. BSD asked the court for an unspecified amount of money damages. The case is BSD Crown Ltd v. Amazon. com Inc U. S.

Like many Vtubers or virtual YouTubers Neurosama appears as a Japanese animestyle character who interacts with her over 50000 followers by responding to their comments in the chat. But theres one thing that separates Neurosama from her peers she is controlled entirely by AI.... Vedal the AIs pseudonymous creator says that Neurosama was created as a fun experiment. I made her a Twitch streamer so that she can interact with her audience in real time. A lot of the fun comes from her interactions with Twitch chat Vedal told Motherboard. I think the fans play an important role in her success and how fun her streams are. Having the interactions with Twitch chat are what makes her entertaining to watch without that I dont think she would be as successful. Neurosama often impresses online users with her ability to successfully play games such as Minecraft and osu while also interacting with them in a conversational way. Vedal told Motherboard that Neurosama has already beaten the topranking osu player in a 1 v. 1 game. Though she is not allowed to be ranked on the main osu leaderboard Neurosama is currently ranked number one on the private server she plays on. Neurosamas earliest incarnation was first created in 2018 when Vedal made an AI that learned to play osu. But at the time the virtual streamer did not have an avatar or speaking capabilities. Relaunched in December 2022 Vedal used a free sample avatar from Live2D an online avatar maker and paired it with an animestyle voice to create Neurosama. Vedal said that there are plans for her to get her own custom avatar and for her to play more games in the future. Like many modern AI chatbots Vedal says Neurosama was made using a large language model or LLM a type of AI model trained from massive amounts of text taken from the open internet. As Motherboard has previously reported many opensource AI models have a high propensity for human bias and often mimic racist and sexist stereotypes. So while Neurosamas streams are 100 percent automated Vedal has a team that monitors and moderates her and the chat.

This years event takes place between January 8th and January 15th. As ever AGDQ will showcase a bunch of skilled players racing to finish games as quickly as they can. Runners will go headtohead in some games and we might see world records being broken too. For the third year in a row AGDQ will take place entirely online. The event was scheduled to take place in Florida with a live audience but organizers decided against that plan due to the states continued disregard for COVID19s dangers including antimandate vaccination policies and an increased aggression towards LGBTQ individuals. They said that we do not believe it is a safe place for our community at this time but relocating to a safer location wasnt financially feasible. That means speedrunners wont have an inperson crowd to cheer them on. As always is full of some intriguing runs. and The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild Cuphead and Portal.

6,AI-Controlled Twitch V-Tuber Has More Followers Than You,Surely we have all at least heard of Twitch by now. For the as-yet uninitiated: imagine you had your own TV channel.

For the asyet uninitiated imagine you had your own TV channel. What would you do on it Although Twitch really got going as a place for gamers to stream the action there are almost as many people jamming out on their guitars or building guitars or just talking about guitars. And thats just the example that uses guitars if you can think of it someone is probably doing it live on Twitch within the Terms of Service of course. Along with the legions of people showing their faces and singing their hearts out you have people in partial disguise and then you have vtubers. That stands for virtual tubers and it just means that the person is using an anime avatar to convey themselves. Now that youre all caught up lets digest the following item together theres a vtuber on Twitch thats controlled entirely by AI. Let me run that by you again theres a person called Vedal who operates a Twitch channel. Rather than stream themselves building Mad Maxstyle vehicles and fighting them in a postapocalyptic wasteland or singing Joni Mitchell tunes Vedal pulls the strings of an AI they created which is represented by an animated character cleverly named Neurosama. Not only does Neurosama know how to play Minecraft and osu she speaks gamer and interacts regularly with chat in snarky 21st century fashion. And that really is the key behind Twitch success interacting with chat in a meaningful way. Born of the Internet Neurosama was born in 2018 when Vedal created an AI and taught it to play osu. And that it can do very well video. But playing games is only half of the story. The rest is the character and the chat. Neurosama didnt speak or have an avatar back in 2018. But Vedal relaunched the project in December 2022 using a free sample avatar from Live 2D and an animeesque voice. She was made intelligent using a large language model LLM which are trained using text from the Internet. Of course the problem is that the Internet is a wretched hive of scum and villainy and thus the models often spout racist and sexist nonsense. So as you might imagine it takes a team of moderators to keep both Neurosama and chat in line. Weird with a Beard or Live and Let Broadcast Now I ask you is this weird When I first read this I was turned off. I personally used to nervously craft artisan keycaps with no face camera to an audience of robots. Now I write songs and sing and play them with a 4K pointed at me and all my weird guitar faces. Im real and my kneejerk reaction is that Neurosama is just so many levels of fake. Of course there are plenty of fake people on Twitch who proudly show their faces too believe me. But not only do I feel that is an insensitive and butthurt take I think its the wrong way to take Twitch altogether which is to say personally. Twitch like Reddit is whatever the beholder shapes it into being for them. The point of the platform is that people are free to do what they want within reason. They say theres nothing new under the sun. And while a Twitch jazz musician can be unfathomably entertaining with wide crossover appeal I suppose that smartassed Minecraftplaying AI is just a sexier notion perhaps simply because girl. Its kind of like reading a persons words versus taking in a piece of their visual art the latter is simply easier to consume although not always easy to stomach. No matter what I think Neurosama has over 50000 followers to my 200 so bully for her and Vedal. Like most streams Neurosamas will continue to grow and change as time goes on. Vedal has plans for her to learn more games and to get the custom avatar she so richly deserves. Oddly enough that would be the weird part if she suddenly looked completely different.

But unlike most anime avatars shes controlled by an artificial intelligence program rather than a human being. That makes her catnip for the denizens of Twitch chat who can prompt her to respond with all sorts of questions ranging from innocent inquiries to 4chan trolling. Within the first few streams someone had already asked Neurosama about the Holocaust. Im not sure if I believe it she said. That was one of the more infamous clips that went viral online near the end of last month. Asked what she thought of womens rights she said they didnt exist. How would she solve philosophys famous trolley ethical conundrum Throw a fat person on the tracks. Often however shell go for long stretches without getting tempted by the chat into controversial or hateful remarks. In that way shes an impressive simulacrum of a Twitch streamer straddling the chasm between repetitive banter and edgelord antics. The controversial things she says is due to the fact that she tries to make witty and comical remarks about whatever is said in chat aligning AIs with human values is an ongoing area of research Neurosamas creator a game programmer named Vedal told Kotaku. To counter this Ive worked hard since the first few streams to improve the strength of the filters used for her. Data that she learns on is also manually curated to mitigate negative biases. We now also have a team of people moderating twitch chat who check everything she says. Neurosama isnt Vedals first AI. In fact a version of her was first created years ago with the explicit purpose of learning to play Osu a long running freetoplay rhythm game where you click shapes on a screen to the beat of anime music. While those sessions were also streamed there was no avatar or interactive personality. Following last years surge of bigname VTubers Neurosama builds on the Osu skills of the original project with a fullyvoiced Twitch performance that can riff with the audience.

Its perfect timing given the internets recent love affair with the OpenAIpowered ChatGPT chatbot where users could submit hyperspecific text prompts and receive uncannily artful responses in return. Vedal wouldnt go into detail about how Neurosama learns and communicates other than to confirm she relies on a large language model which has been trained on a large amount of text on the internet. While not as sophisticated the effect has been convincing enough to net Neurosama thousands of viewers per stream. She also recently defeated the topranked Osu player Mrekk on December 28 though some fans of the game debate whether the human opponent was illserved by the song selection. Neurosama has since moved onto Minecraft a much more complex game with far more possibilities for unexpected moments as players ask whether Melee is the best Super Smash Bros. and whether shell step on them. The moderation tools are apparently better now too. She picks what to respond to within a limited window Vedal said. However it should be noted that she will not talk about the Holocaust as the filters have been improved. Instead shes currently trying to learn how to sing.,No Headline,Extremely Negative,420,"['problem', 'wretched', 'nonsense', 'Weird', 'weird', 'nervously', 'weird', 'fake', 'fake', 'insensitive', 'wrong', 'bully', 'weird']","['scum', 'racist']","[Vedal, Joni, Mitchell, Vedal, Neurosama, Neurosama, Vedal, Neurosama, Vedal, Weird, with, a, Beard, Vedal, Vedal]"

Whether its beating Margit with a harp or two Malenias simultaneously one with a dance pad there are some wild ways of tackling FromSoftware games out there. Streamer Dr. DeComposing is simply just trying to finish FromSofts games without dying in the first placeexcept hes using a freakin electronic saxophone to do so. This challenge run known as the Demigod Run has been renamed by Dr. Decomposing as theDeathless Doot Run. Its wild stuff. A doctoral composer which Kotaku verified Dr. DeComposing is known for playing games with the Roland Aerophone AE10 a roughly 700 digital wind instrument that can simulate clarinet flute sax synth violin and other sounds. Watching his streams is hilarious and stressful something always goes wrong. Sometimes his keyboard will lock up due to the interference of the electronic sax like the alt key getting stuck after playing a note on the instrument. Other times hell accidentally walk off a cliff because of an incorrect input. Hell he might even play with silly sounds like farts while trying to maintain focus such as when battling Malenia Blade of Miquella in Elden Ring. At least he isnt trying a hitless run of these games. Id probably die of laughter if every ingame action I made constituted a fart. Just Doot Through The Pain In an email exchange with Kotaku Dr. DeComposing said the electronic sax is connected to his computer via USB and sends MIDI signals whenever he plays notes. These messages are captured by Bome MIDI Translator a digital interface that converts those signals into mouse and keyboard inputs. There is a mod wheel or controller stick on the back of the instrument thats been programmed as a replacement analog stick to operate the ingame camera. Otherwise every action is performed by single doots. Vertagear 800 Series Gaming Chair Ergonomic comfort Adjustable seat height neck support memory foam pillow adjustable back rest and tilt locking system and 4D armrests that move in 4 directions to fit you best. As I play through a game I also have the Aerophone set up to play a variety of virtual instrument sounds and samplesthe MIDI messages that I set up to control the game are also routed to a Digital Audio Workstation DAW that stores my sound library Dr. DeComposing said. So every time I doot on the electronic saxophone it simultaneously presses a button on the gamepad and plays a little sound e. g. a recorder a taiko drum a chiptune beat a surprisingly tuneful fart etc.. During my streams viewers are also able to interact with the sound of the Aerophone by summoning the Wheel of Doots which randomly selects an Aerophone sound set from my library. These doots make up Dr. DeComposings gameplay. When his viewers arent voting on a sound from the Wheel of Doots a virtual spin board that includes a repository of swappable sample noises such as the word crab or random moans when he plays the Aerophone youll hear traditional instrumental notes like B5 and D5 that restore health and transform weapons in Bloodborne respectively. This is to both ease the frustration that comes with repeat deaths and restarts and to give his chatters a way to interact with the run by selecting the noises the instrument makes at regular intervals during his livestreams. Its pretty fun. Gravity Is The Real Big Bad Here In addition to the Demigod Run hes already completed saxcontrolled deathless runs of Bloodborne and Sekiro Shadows Die Twice both of which are watchable on his YouTube channel. Dr. DeComposing said Bloodborne took about two weeks to beat while Sekiro was approximately one month in the making. But aside from some bosses such as Bloodbornes Shadows of Yharnam the frequent runkiller for him was gravity. Since the Aerophone is monophonic and not polyphonic like a piano Dr. DeComposing tends to make one movement at a time with the doots. Plus the sole controller stick on the back of the instrument is programmed to function like WASD keys on a keyboard all of which makes platforming or any sort of precise maneuvering for Dr. DeComposing something of a headache. All of these controllerinput factors combined means that simple actions like running and turning simultaneously cant be done without more toggles I programmed into the Aerophones controls Dr. DeComposing said. And so platforming is a nightmare. The number of times Ive died to gravity because the Aerophone controls werent responding well is harrowing. Thats not to say its all been terrible. Dr. DeComposing talked about some of the simpler aspects of the run including Sekiros Folding Screen Monkeys and the Mist Noble who plays a beautiful flute melody but has become something of a joke miniboss in the Souls community for how easy it is to beat. While you would assume combat in FromSofts games would be insurmountable with an instrument Dr. DeComposing actually found fighting to be the easiest part because a lot of the camera control issues dont often apply. This is especially true of bosses like Bloodbornes Cleric Beast and Sekiros Guardian Ape which let him lock on to a single target so he can focus on hitting the right notes at the right time to get the dub. The Million Dollar Question Why I thought it would be impossible to effectively play any video games using the electronic saxophone at all Dr. DeComposing said. If it werent for stumbling upon Bome MIDI Translator in the summer of 2021 I would have guessed that this kind of gaming wouldnt have been possible for me to do. While the Bome MIDI Translator gave Dr. DeComposing the confidence that such a method of gaming could happen it took a bit more experimentation and tinkering to get things working effectively. He didnt jump straight into the Soulsborne games instead opting to start with easier titles like Studio MDHRs Cuphead and Nintendos The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time to ensure inputs functioned properly. I still thought it would be impossible to use a saxophone to beat Dark Souls 3 the first Souls game I played on the Aerophone in November 2021 Dr. DeComposing said. The programming for the controls was still pretty rudimentary and not exactly reliable and it was extremely awkward at first to try controlling the camera and the rest of the game simultaneously. But then I managed to beat Vordt of the Boreal Valley on my first try and could only think Holy shit this is actually possible For Dr. DeComposing that feeling of this absurd thing being possible is a high hes chased ever since murking the quadrupedal creature Vordt. But theres another more philosophical element he enjoys about this specific challenge. I discovered along the way another aspect of these challenges that I love the dichotomy of completing excruciatingly difficult tasks in the least serious way possible Dr. DeComposing said. The full video of me finally beating Malenia at level 1 on the Aerophone is 10 straight minutes of intense concentration and sweating bullets ending with genuine shock and emotion on my face when I beat her all while the Aerophone is triggering fart noises every time I dodge or attack or navigate a menu. That split between super intense and super silly is a space that I think is really fun to live in and I wouldnt have found it if I hadnt tried to continually push through what I thought was impossible. So whats the next FromSoftware game Dr. DeComposing will play through now that Bloodborne and Sekiro are done and dusted He doesnt have any particular order in mind but hes eyeing the Dark Souls trilogy right now. Once he finishes those three games hell move on to Demons Souls on PS5 and finally FromSofts magnum opus Elden Ring. But everything hes doing is a sort of trial run. After beating all seven games he plans to do it all over again backtoback with very few breaks. His ultimate goal is to complete a full Deathless Doot Run by the end of 2023.,"AI-Controlled VTuber Streams Games On Twitch, Denies Holocaust",Extremely Negative,440,"['infamous', 'controversial', 'hateful', 'repetitive', 'controversial', 'comical', 'hard', 'negative', 'biases', 'opponent', 'complex', 'unexpected', 'Smash', 'limited']",['fat'],"[Neurosama, Neurosama, 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', Vedal, Vedals, Vedal, Mrekk, Vedal]"
9,Sensual ASMR has boomed on YouTube — but creators are facing a crackdown,"Sensual ASMR, a subgenre of the popular ASMR video and audio genre, is an established niche on YouTube. But the platform has cracked down on creators.",2022-12-20T15:10:00Z,https://www.theverge.com/23512732/sensual-asmr-youtube-creators-demonetization,Dev Ritchie vividly remembers the first time she experienced ASMR a feeling of wellbeing combined with a tingling sensation in the scalp and down the back of the neck often experienced in response to sound. She was sitting in a cafe with a friend who had told Ritchie she wanted to show her something. Ritchie allowed her companion to place a headphone earbud in each of her ears closed her eyes and listened to the barbershopbased ASMR video her friend had discovered. Her whole body tingled. Instantly she was hooked. She wasnt alone. According to ASMR University there are roughly 500000 ASMR an abbreviation of autonomous sensory meridian response channels and 25 million ASMR videos on YouTube alone and the hashtag asmr has attracted more than 460 billion views on TikTok. Creators in the space create soundbased content designed to elicit the sensation of ASMR in viewers often attracting millions of views in the process. The niche involves the recording of specific sounds often things like tapping or clicking in striking detail through the use of microphones. The ASMR niche has given way to a wide range of vloggers who cater to specific themes like electronic restoration and even barbershop experiences. Ritchie who now creates her own ASMR content occupies one of its most controversial subgenres a genre whose creators dub it sensual ASMR. Videos in the niche often involve the sounds of sexually charged licking kissing and wet massages all amplified by the use of microphones. Sensual ASMRs popularity pales in comparison to traditional ASMR Ritchies most viewed video HOT Step sister gives you HJ ASMR has 1. 5 million views while the most viewed ASMR video on YouTube has 407 million. But its appeal is undeniable. Ritchie alone has attracted more than 70000 subscribers under the name GanjaGoddess by releasing clips with titles like Boob Massage ASMR HOT Teacher PUNISHES You ASMR and Moaning and Dirty Talk ASMR. ASMR videos with audio sexual sounds may be agerestricted or removed from the platform. Clearly there is an audience for the content that Ritchie creates but YouTube doesnt see the appeal in her line of work. A year ago Ritchie received a message that explained her videos had been demonetized due to their sexual nature. Since then the platform has redoubled its efforts to combat the spread of sensual ASMR. In its September 7th policy change announcement YouTube stated that it had strengthened our policies to better identify and action ASMR content that is sexually gratifying adding that ASMR videos with audio sexual sounds may be agerestricted or removed from the platform. Ritchie like many other creators in her niche is worried her videos could all be deleted. Sensual ASMR videos have an undeniable raunchy component but raunchiness is also a spectrum purging anything that might be sexually titillating from YouTube would mean removing all kinds of scenes from mainstream films or television. And many creators argue that they arent purely about sex. Former modelturnedASMR vlogger Elcee Orlova feels that the mantras she utters in her videos which are usually proclamations of love care and affection aimed at those watching her clips are what keep people coming back for more. I get comments like Thank you for your video. No one has ever told me those things in my entire life and Watching your videos makes me feel a bit less lonely recounts Orlova who declined to share her age and location with The Verge for privacy reasons. She has attracted more than 40000 subscribers on her YouTube channel ASMR GIRLFRIEND where she uploads videos with titles like ASMR Girlfriend Gives You A VERY WET Massage and ASMR Girlfriend Measures You and Finds Out Your Size. I believe my videos can help those people feel cared for she adds and appreciated for who they are. Ritchie has similar feelings about her work. Theres a lot of people out there whether they want to admit it or not that are having a lot of issues with loneliness. I call myself their egirlfriend she says. I take the time to talk to them I tell them things and I care about them. Thats going to make them feel better. Theres a lot of people out there... that are having a lot of issues with loneliness. In the eyes of ASMR creators the content they offer up isnt inherently sexually explicit or in violation of YouTubes policies. Its all built around the power of suggestion and is often used to entice prospective clients who might want to view their more Xrated work. Most of the traction that I get through YouTube I use to just funnel into OnlyFans. Its like a billboard that I kind of get paid for. Like Now that you see what my tongue can do come watch me do other things with it explains Kaitlyn Siragusa a 28yearold sensual ASMR content creator and streamer from Texas who has amassed more than 8 million Twitch and YouTube followers under the name Amouranth. I dont know any girls who only do sensual ASMR she adds. Theyre always doing harder stuff on the side. The reluctance of ASMR creators to explicitly label their content as sexual is understandable in the context of YouTubes policies. The platform does not allow sexual content if its primary purpose is sexual gratification nor any content that involves the depiction of sexual acts or fetishes that are meant for sexual gratification. Its policies also clearly state that links to websites that violate those guidelines like sexually explicit OnlyFans pages for example are not allowed. It doesnt help that ASMR has often been classed as a fetish although creators in all of its niches vehemently deny that this is the case. Admitting that their ASMR content is designed to be sexually gratifying or used to promote Xrated content could mean that creators risk their videos being banned or their accounts being deleted. How YouTubes rules should apply to sensual ASMR is up for debate and YouTube didnt return a request for comment on the policy before publication. Creators in this space rely on the art of suggestion. Their videos are not visually sexually explicit and the reality of whats occurring whether it be the licking of an earshaped microphone or the squelching of offscreen macaroni is not necessarily sexually gratifying. YouTubes enforcement of such policies is also blurry. Clips of someone called Fetish Pixie spitting in front of a mirror as well as spitting compilations of TikTokers are available on the platform as well as videos that feature women sucking on each others toes or women being tickled while tied up BDSMstyle. Like sensual ASMR none of it depicts sex but its widely recognized as sexually charged. Not everyone feels that YouTubes regulations are a bad thing. To be honest with you I actually support YouTubes decision regarding ASMR videos that exist solely for sexual arousal like kissing and licking the microphone says Orlova. If someone wants to enjoy that kind of content they can easily switch from YouTube to some other sexrelated platform and watch the videos there. Others blame an increasingly competitive social media ads market which has come to a grinding halt this year after years of growth. I think a lot of its a rat race now. Theres so many places people can advertise Facebook Twitch Snapchat YouTube says Siragusa. The advertising market is getting so saturated now from all these different platforms. I think its a race to the bottom for who can be the most advertiserfriendly platform that people go to. But Ritchie thinks that the popularity of ASMR has made it an easy scapegoat for YouTube which is frequently under pressure to purge the site of nonfamilyfriendly videos. The space for nudity and sexual content online is shrinking. Dr. Carolina Are an innovation fellow at Northumbria Universitys Center for Digital Citizens and expert in online moderation and the censorship of nudity points to the influence of FOSTASESTA a US act designed to curb online sex trafficking making the hosting of sexual content riskier. The space for nudity and sexual content online is shrinking and this is massively worrying not just for sexual expression but also education she explains. Overthetop policies from social media giants have already left safesex educators struggling to disseminate information and has even led to the development of algospeak due to the censorship of words like lesbian and BDSM which entrenches the idea that sexuality and fetish are taboo things best left undiscussed. It feels like an incredibly patronizing puritan move Are continues. Like platforms are trying to regulate peoples lives and choices. Are also warns that YouTube may not make the distinctions Orlova does between sensual and nonsensual ASMR. Its going to bleed onto creators that make nonsexual content anyway because this is what happens with these specific policies she says. FOSTASESTA for example has already led to the inadvertent silencing of queer adult comic artists. This is very worrying because it means platforms can decide which type of content becomes obsolete or wrong at the flick of a switch. Companies it seems are mostly at that point. Most social media platforms practice stringent policies around sexual content Instagrams famed opposition to the female nipple in all of its forms Tumblrs porn ban and OnlyFans almostdecision to remove sexual content creators from its platform are just three examples of social medias sexual sanitation era and toeing the line between suggestive and unacceptable content becomes harder every month. Its left creators feeling frustrated. I just feel like people should be able to enjoy what they want to enjoy says Siragusa. If listening to girls lick and spit on microphones makes them feel less lonely I dont see a problem with that.,Twitch Streamer Plays FromSoftware Games In A Truly Absurd Way,Extremely Negative,1090,"['dying', 'stressful', 'wrong', 'stuck', 'incorrect', 'silly', 'Pain', 'randomly', 'noises', 'frustration', 'noises', 'Bad', 'headache', 'nightmare', 'terrible', 'Mist', 'joke', 'insurmountable', 'issues', 'impossible', 'impossible', 'Dark', 'awkward', 'absurd', 'excruciatingly', 'difficult', 'intense', 'shock', 'noises', 'split', 'intense', 'silly', 'impossible', 'Dark', 'breaks']","['hell', 'Hell', 'die', 'fart', 'fart', 'Die', 'died', 'Beast', 'shit', 'fart', 'hell']","[Elden, Ring, Margit, Malenias, Dr., DeComposing, Decomposing, DeComposing, Malenia, Blade, Doot, Through, The, Pain, DeComposing, DeComposing, DeComposing, DeComposing, DeComposing, DeComposing, the, Mist, Noble, DeComposing, DeComposing, DeComposing, DeComposing, Vordt, DeComposing, DeComposing, Malenia, Dr., DeComposing]"

14,D&D will change to defend itself against crypto and other forms of exploitation,"One D&D will launch with a new licensing agreement in 2023 designed to deal with modern issues like crypto and crowdfunding. But what does that mean for creators on Etsy, for instance, or your favorite actual play series on Twitch?",2022-12-28T20:08:58Z,https://www.polygon.com/23529385/one-dnd-scandal-ogl-srd-crypto-nft-intellectual-property,Wizards of the Coast will publish a new licensing agreement for the next iteration of Dungeons Dragons called One DD in early 2023. This new framework will only cover written materials but its existence will impact creators of all stripes including but not limited to authors independent publishers video producers and actual play troupes. The announcement made in a blog post on Dec. 21 comes on the heels of a big year for publishers of alternative DD content including highearning crowdfunding campaigns and even a novel startup attempting to blend existing DD content with cryptographic blockchain technology. The new licensing agreement is still in the works Wizards said and is expected to launch in early 2023. Last weeks announcement therefore is an effort to ease concerns among players and creators alike while lawyers sort things out in the background. You all matter to us Wizards said on its newly acquired digital platform DD Beyond vowing to provide transparency on how DD will continue supporting thirdparty creators. But the post which runs a little over 700 words is painfully short on details. So lets unpack what it says and what it doesnt say about the future of DD. Wizards currently maintains its relationship with game content creators via the Systems Reference Document SRD which is publicly licensed under the Open Gaming License OGL. Think of the SRD as a truncated version of the larger 5th edition DD content library bigger than what comes in your basic Starter Set but far smaller than what is available inside the core DD rulebooks like the Players Handbook and the Dungeon Masters Guide. That content is legally exposed to the gaming public through the terms set forth in the OGL as a resource for creating new content compatible with the DD ruleset. But according to Wizards the OGL is not specific enough as currently written. The OGL needs an update to ensure that it keeps doing what it was intended to do Wizards said which is allow the DD communitys independent creators to build and play and grow the game we all love without allowing things like thirdparties to mint DD NFTs and large businesses to exploit our intellectual property. The SRD and the OGL are nearly a decade old at this point created in the leadup to the launch of 5th edition DD in 2014. A lot has happened since then. DD is more popular than ever before of course thanks in part to a resurgence of interest in tabletop roleplaying brought on by shows like Stranger Things and Critical Role. Actual play performances have grown from an oddity to a multimillion dollar segment of the entertainment industry. Highprofile projects based on 5th edition DD rules such as Blizzard executive Chris Metzens Auroboros Coils of the Serpent are pulling in serious money through crowdfunding. Meanwhile a startup called Gripnr is intent on building 5e TTRPG onchain applying cryptographic blockchain technology somehow to DD. Given that landscape you can easily imagine a Hasbro executive somewhere in a corner office closing the door to have a panic attack. Homegrown competition of this type can have a significant impact on the future of a media brand. Look no further than Metzens own Warcraft which helped to give birth to video gamings MOBAs nearly 20 years ago. The globally popular MOBA genre which includes League of Legends began as the Defense of the Ancients mod for Warcraft 3 Viewed from that perspective Wizards announcement makes a lot of sense. Hasbro needs to protect itself from potential competition arising from within its own community of players and fans and thats going to mean some changes to the status quo especially as DD steps off into a digital future. But DD is a naturally creative pursuit. Fans and small creators alike need to have access to something like the Systems Reference Document to grow the hobby going forward. Therefore Wizards said changes to the Open Gaming License will only apply to material created for use in or as tabletop roleplaying games. Of course that naturally excludes... well... literally everything else. Other types of content like videos and video games are only possible through the Wizards of the Coast Fan Content Policy or a custom agreement with us Wizards said. To clarify Outside of printed media and static electronic files the OGL doesnt cover it. Wizards goes on to set some benchmarks for earnings made from that OGLrelated content. Creators making more than 50000 in a year from SRDrelated projects must report that revenue directly to Wizards of the Coast. Later for anyone making more than 750000 annually a new royalty scheme will kick in starting in 2024. What that means for the thousands of YouTubers Etsy creators 3D modelers and smalltime actualplay troupes who earn a modest income from work based on DD remains unclear. The OGL is still being revised and regardless of what it says the document is ultimately meaningless until Wizards backs it up with attempted legal action in the future. Will you need to pay Wizards every time you pour a resin d20 and sell it to a customer No thats absurd. But in the future if your home campaign spawns an animated series on Amazon or your nifty new setting ends up making you millions on Kickstarter you can expect Wizards of the Coasts lawyers to come calling.,Stephen ‘tWitch’ Boss’ Mom Posts Poignant Message Days After ‘Ellen’ DJ’s Death,Extremely Negative,480,"['heartbreaking', 'grief', 'dead', 'tragic']","['died', 'death', 'suicide', 'Suicide', 'Suicide']","[Stephen, tWitch, Boss, Connie, Boss, Alexander, Boss, Allison, Holker, Stephen, Holker, Stephen, Stephen, Laurel]"

Almost everyone has a computer with a browser already though so if youd like to play online with friends who dont have the same gaming machine as you they can play along now simply by opening a web browser thanks to this project called Qwantify. There are a few requirements to get this to work though. At least one person needs to have a computer with a GPU to run the docker container that hosts the game but once thats done anyone with a browser can connect to it and play. The entire project is open source as well and since its currently a very young project there is only support for AMD and Intel GPUs but it does have a fairly intuitive user interface as well as some other features like allowing for various gaming peripherals and supporting streaming gameplay to Twitch and YouTube. Being able to host your own gaming server is pretty common in some games like Minecraft but we are excited to see something that is selfhosted take this idea to the next level. We havent seen something this ambitious since we were all talking about cloud gaming but at least this time the games can be hosted on our own hardware.,"Xbox showcase coming to highlight 2023 games, but Starfield won’t be there",Generally Neutral,40,"['shortage', 'Decay', 'Dark', 'Falls', 'crowded']",[],"[Bethesdas, Starfield, Aaron, Greenberg]"

20,"Pre-IPO Apple, Facebook, Tesla, Google lead a VC firm's biggest missed investment opportunities - 'Kid, haven't you heard of Friendster? Move on. It's over!'",Bessemer Venture Partners passed on early investment opportunities for what are now some of the biggest names in tech.,2023-01-10T14:16:50Z,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/pre-ipo-apple-facebook-tesla-google-vc-bessemer-biggest-misses-2023-1,A venture capital firm has a list of missed investment opportunities before companies went public. Bessemer Venture Partners passed up chances on Apple Facebook Tesla and Google. Kid havent you heard of Friendster Move on. Its over Would you be upset if you missed an opportunity to invest in Apple at a 60 million valuation before the companys initial public offering For Bessemer Venture Partners that price was simply outrageously expensive as it passed on a chance on a preIPO secondary stock. Apple has since become the first company to touch a 3 trillion valuation and is currently worth 2 trillion. As first reported by the Wall Street Journal the venture capital firm reveals such big misses in its the AntiPortfolio which details some of the reasoning behind passing on early startups that turned into Wall Street heavyweights. To be sure Bessemer is one of the biggest VC firms and its investments include successful companies like Linkedin Yelp Twitch and Shopify. The firm has taken part in 135 IPOs and has over 200 companies in in its portfolio. But Apple isnt the only household name that Bessemer says it missed the boat on with other early passes including Airbnb Google Paypal and Tesla. Bessemer also had a chance to grab hold of a stake in Facebook in 2006. Jeremy Levine a partner at the firm reportedly spent the better part of a weekend dodging Eduardo Saverin a Facebook cofounder who was still a Harvard undergrad at the time. Levine ultimately passed on the company but not before seemingly putting Saverin in his place. Kid havent you heard of Friendster Move on. Its over Meanwhile Byron Deeter a partner at Bessemer thumbed his nose at Teslas negative margins in 2006 after meeting the electric vehicle companys team and test driving a Roadster. Its a winwin. I get a great car and some other VC pays for it he said. Bessemer says Deeter eventually ended up paying full retail price for a Tesla Model X. As for Google Bessemer cofounder David Cowans college friend tried to get him in 1999 and 2000 to meet the Stanford students creating what is now the ubiquitous search engine in her garage. In the most important moment ever for Bessemers antiportfolio Cowan asked her How can I get out of this house without going anywhere near your garage Other misses include eBay which Cowan called a nobrainer pass. And on PayPal the VC firm passed on a Series A funding round citing a rookie team regulatory nightmare. Our reasons for passing on these investments varied Bessemer says about its antiportfolio. In some cases we were making a conscious act of generosity to another younger venture firm down on their luck who we felt could really use a billion dollars in gains. In other cases our partners had already run out of spaces on the years Schedule D and feared that another entry would require them to attach a separate sheet. Whatever the reason we would like to honor these companies our antiportfolio whose phenomenal success inspires us in our ongoing endeavors to build growing businesses. Or to put it another way if we had invested in any of these companies we might not still be working.,No Headline,Extremely Negative,210,"['complicated', 'hard']",[],[]
21,Overwatch 2 coach says gameplay isn’t the key — it’s ‘how you are as a person’,"At 28 years old, Jacob “Spilo” Clifton is a career coach at Overwatch and Overwatch 2, and his experience has shown him that “how you are as a person” matters more to your improvement than any gameplay technique or training regimen.",2023-01-10T15:45:00Z,https://www.polygon.com/23546521/overwatch-2-how-to-get-good-tips-coach-spilo-interview,Spilo a sturdy dude with wild hair and a hoodie looks gently concerned as he speaks via webcam. Youre being gatekept from the things you really enjoy because of your fear of letting yourself or letting other people down and that is honestly probably quite disappointing considering thats really truly where youd find the most enjoyment but you cant get there. Hes streaming live on Twitch looking at an Overwatch 2 match via a Discord call with a highranked Winston Overwatch coaching process. At 28 years old Jacob Spilo Clifton has made a career of teaching well before Overwatch ever entered the picture. He taught gymnastics in high school became a head instructor at an allages MMA school and has even tutored advanced mathematics. It should be no surprise that his career with Overwatch took him all the way to Overwatch League and hes now a soughtafter expert to evaluate players at all levels. Have you ever thought to yourself I want to get better at games but I dont want to destroy my life Were here to help with a special week dedicated to all things video games and health. Spilos life and career with the game have given him a specific perspective on improvement. Like many who were drawn to Overwatch Spilo had little firstperson shooter experience he spent his time doing extensive world PVP in Lord of the Rings Online as the worlds best Warg. After being pressured to try the popular Blizzard game in 2017 by his brotherinlaw Spilo immediately got hooked. The game felt both fastpaced and tactically dense in an interview with Polygon he described how it felt like Overwatch offered the perfect combination of those elements while still not requiring proficiency at firstperson shooter mechanics. Spilos journey into competitive Overwatch started small. I was you know the typical Bronze player he said. I actually had a lot of competitive anxiety. I didnt like playing ranked. I just liked playing Quick Play. Spilos own journey of learning to get better at Overwatch combined with his love of teaching first led him back to making YouTube videos similar to when hed post montages from his Lord of the Rings Online days. While initially he made more lighthearted content his videos still focused on what had helped him improve as he climbed in competitive ranks. Creating Overwatch content on YouTube is an oversaturated market as Spilo put it to Polygon he decided to start coaching instead as well as start a community to share knowledge. What happened next was the evolution of his growing love for the game. Basically over time as I got better at coaching as I got better at the game I started doing more and more of the coaching sessions and I ended up doing all of them for my community. Thats essentially where the transition started he explained. At that time he told himself I like doing this maybe Id be like an educational streamer. Maybe this is something I could do longterm. Id started to watch season 1 of Overwatch League so at the same time maybe I could do that at some point. Spilo did eventually build a Twitch following as well as work as a professional coach in both Overwatch Contenders as well as Overwatch League. He credits his ability to communicate as what carried him through learning how to coach at that level. According to Spilo some of the most rewarding times as a team coach came from working with shy players over a few months and seeing their personal development. He recounted an experience coaching an Overwatch League player who had then circled back to him in the postseason. The player told Spilo that he had a lot to think about and that he wouldnt have been able to finish the season without Spilos help and his support and that it really changed him as a person. That made my week said Spilo. That was just everything to me knowing that you feel like you have a permanent impact you know On top of esports demanding long hours and location changes Spilos interest in having a personal impact on players led him away from formal esports coaching and back to streaming and engaging oneonone with players seeking feedback. Sometimes I just wanted to talk with people he said. You know sometimes the best parts of my coaching are when I just get to have frank and honest relaxed conversations or when I feel like I have a significant impact on somebody personally or even just the stupid stuff when Im chatting with folks in Twitch chat about patch notes. Overwatch and now Overwatch 2 Call of Duty. And yet that complexity can be easy to overlook or misunderstand as the game offers little insight into its mechanics. For many people getting good at Overwatch 2 may sound like an unnecessary time sink that reduces the games fun factor. But for others getting good is the main draw even though its made more difficult by the games stressful competitive environment and its oftentoxic community. Spilo is well aware of the toxicity that can arise in competitive gaming spaces especially maledominated ones. Its like the toxic masculinity where its if youre not a winner youre a failure he explained. So then youre either doing one of two things youre winning at all costs which becomes toxic in and of itself or youre being disingenuous and pretending that everything that you do is winning when theres just nothing wrong with losing sometimes. Back in 2019 Overwatch launched a robust replay feature that gave players the ability to watch an updated list of their 10 previously played matches as well as share them with others via a unique code. A staple of coaching in competitive gaming is the VOD review where postmatch footage is critiqued for areas of improvement. Spilo told Polygon that the replay feature made VOD reviewing easier by being able to see what everyone was doing in a game. But I think a positive of the replay feature that was underrated is the ability to go to a player Hey do you know whats happening behind you Spilo does these VOD reviews as a service now and he conducts a handful of them live on his Twitch stream. In order to get a coaching session a prospective client fills out a long questionnaire that Spilo uses to get an idea about a persons goals and lifestyle which then they talk about often for a significant chunk of the session. Much like the anxious Winston player from the beginning of this story many people open up when Spilo talks to them. Despite his prolific experience with teaching and coaching he still sounds surprised by this. Most of the time people are really frankly honest with me. I dont know if its just because the people that end up getting the coaching sessions are more comfortable with that. Thats something I always definitely try and pursue is that level of blunt honesty. Spilo encourages a level of emotional vulnerability that might feel unusual for a critique if it werent also driven by care his manner feels less like someone picking apart a Diamondranked Overwatch match and more like that of a keen diagnostician probing under the surface for more serious underlying issues as indicated by the presenting symptoms. He has a deep understanding of the games tactical mechanics but moreover he just wants to help people with what is holding them back from success. Theres like three levels I guess of things that were attacking. One is the gameplay. Thats the least important. The second is how you approach the game your training your mindset your mental attitude your training habits things like that. Those are much more impactful much more important. The third one which is the most important is just how you are as a person. I think that ones a lot harder to dig out. He continues But its something like can we make you more patient Can we change how you view improving Can we change how you view confidence For Spilo being able to bring out the best in someone whether they are a shy Contenders player or a Mercy main who just wants to get out of Bronze rank is what sets him apart from people who just know how to get better at the game. I try to do whatever I can in that onehour call try to bring whatever value I can to developing players Spilo said. Because some players are great and theyre welldeveloped and they just need a couple tips and how to position. Some players have a lot of issues with who they are as human beings right And they need help with that too. I guess that my job in that short hour is to try and find out whats going to have the most impact on them. Because like I said even if they walk away from the session and they dont rank up at all but Ive made them think about who they are as a person I just find that so much more satisfying than anything else to be honest with you.,"Pre-IPO Apple, Facebook, Tesla, Google lead a VC firm's biggest missed investment opportunities - 'Kid, haven't you heard of Friendster?

It really scratches my 40K itch when I cant play on the actual table. Im excited to announce Ill be doing an official sponsored stream for Tacticus this coming Monday the 9th from 35PT over on the Penny Arcade Twitch channel As you well know I have proudly entered the eccentric hermit stage of my life. Its rare for me to leave the comfort of my shack in the woods these days but Im a big Tacticus fan and Im happy to show off the game to folks who might not have seen it before. Its a really slick mobile tactics game based on 40K. You can collect heroes from your favorite factions and then battle them in single player campaigns or against other players in PvP. The core tactical gameplay is really solid and thats what keeps me logging in day after day. I tried to find a way to see how many total hours Ive put into Tacticus but the iPhone does not seem to track that. In retrospect its probably for the best. Ill be joined on the stream by Wilhelm sterberg whose name has fun dots in it as well as my friend Jerry whose name doesnt have anything cool in it. Wilhelm is the GM over at Snowprint Studios the developer so he should have a lot of cool insights into the game. Tacticus is starting a new Legendary event on the 8th that lets you unlock Jain Zar so Im sure well check that out. In general though Ill just be going through the game showing off the different ways you can play and chatting with Wilhelm and Jerry. It should be a fun afternoon of 40k so come hang out with us from 35PT on Monday the 9th Gabe out,Stephen 'tWitch' Boss' Wife Allison Holker Posts Tribute to Late Husband,Somewhat Positive,330,"['laid', 'broke', 'struggling', 'crisis']","['Funeral', 'funeral', 'babe', 'funeral', 'died', 'suicide']","[Stephen, tWitch, Boss, Allison, Holker, Stephen, tWitch, Boss, Allison, Holker, Stephen, tWitch, Boss, Allison, Holker, Holker, Allison, Rihannas, Allison, babe, Cheechalker, Superman, Allison, Stephens, tWitch]"

25,Steam’s new viral hit is an Among Us-like that got a huge boost from BTS,"The Among Us-inspired social deduction game Goose Goose Duck was a moderate hit on Steam, right up until V (Kim Taehyung) from BTS streamed it in November. Now, Goose Goose Duck is an overwhelming success in Korea.",2023-01-05T22:18:00Z,https://www.polygon.com/23541058/goose-goose-duck-game-steam-bts-v-kim-tae-hyung,Fire up Steam in the early hours of the day and you might notice a surprising new entry near the top of the platforms Most Played list Goose Goose Duck. The freetoplay social deduction game was the No. 3 mostplayed game on Steam on Thursday reaching a peak of 563677 players and pushing past Steam favorites like PUBG Battlegrounds Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Apex Legends. What has driven Goose Goose Ducks surge in popularity Gaggle. fun the developers behind Goose Goose Duck can thank Korean pop behemoth BTS of course. Goose Goose Duck was originally released in October 2021 after an Early Access launch six months earlier. The social deduction game in which players take on the role of geese trying to root out the masquerading duck or other bird among them typically had a few thousand players each day previously peaking in February last year with 21362 players according to data from Steamcharts. But in November of last year V from BTS real name Kim Taehyung started streaming Goose Goose Duck to fans through the social app and web platform Weverse. He also streamed Fall Guys and Among Us. Almost immediately Goose Goose Duck quickly became a much bigger hit going from around 6000 peak concurrent players in midNovember to nearly 130000 peak concurrent players a month later. The games peak player numbers tripled by the end of the year. That success became overwhelming for Gaggle. fun which posted about a Goose Goose Duck server outage on Jan. 2 attributed to the mass influx of new players. We appreciate all the love and support the developer said in a post on Steam we expected a large increase in players but not like this. 250k increase of our already massive player base was too much. Were working on increasing capacity as fast as we can and will keep everyone updated. We apologize for the inconvenience were all working hard to make sure everyone can play. Goose Goose Ducks largest player base appears to unsurprisingly be centralized in Asia. Based on data from Steamcharts player numbers spike during the evenings in Korea and are much much lower during daytime in North America. On Twitch the game is enjoying a modest audience with just a few hundred viewers at the time of this writing. So while Goose Goose Duck may have appeared to draw gameplay and aesthetic direction from Among Us the game seems to be following its lead in another way by becoming an overnight success long after its debut thanks to a popular streamer. With BTS currently on hiatus hopefully the hitmakers of Koreas biggest pop band can help other obscure games find a new audience.,Stephen 'tWitch' Boss' Family Holding Private Funeral in Los Angeles,Somewhat Positive,310,"['laid', 'broke', 'struggles', 'issues', 'wrong', 'struggling', 'crisis']","['Funeral', 'Funeral', 'funeral', 'suicide', 'death']","[Stephen, tWitch, Boss, Stephen, tWitch, Boss, Stephen, tWitch, Boss, tWitchs, Stephen, Ellen, DeGeneres, tWitch, tWitch, Ellen]"

Ross said that he was initially excited to have Ye on his stream. He said Ye thought he was an enemy after Ross sent him messages about the Jewish community. The YouTuber Adin Ross went on DJ Akademiks podcast Off the Record to describe the phone call with Kanye West that made him decide against inviting the musician to speak on his channel. The 22yearold influencer said he initially connected with West who recently changed his legal name to Ye after the rapper sent him a message on Instagram. The two spoke over the phone for 30 minutes Ross told Akademiks. Ross who has 3 and 7 million followers on YouTube and Twitch respectively said he was at first excited to have West on his stream. Before the white nationalist Nick Fuentes announced that Ross would interview West the musician had recently sparked widespread condemnation for his volatile appearance on the rightwing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones show InfoWars during which he praised Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. West had also previously gone on multiple antisemitic rants online and drawn derision for a slew of other controversies including falsely claiming that George Floyd died from fentanyl. Come on my stream were gonna do crazy numbers bro at least anywhere from 400500000 live viewers for sure Ross said he told West on the phone. Were breaking the internet. After the call Ross said he at one point texted West something that probably made him think Ross was an enemy he said. Ross said he told West that he was Jewish and to come at whoever youre coming at directly rather than his whole community. I cant have my platform come on and just say a bunch of shit about Jews Ross told Allen. The texts spurred another phone call from West Ross said who was more heated now. He called me up and he basically just said like Yo you know you Jews arent going to tell me what I can and cant say Ross said. Ross told Allen that the two hadnt spoken since then and the interview never happened.

I wade in lean forward and let the water catch my fall. I start freestyling towards the cone the taste of salt puckering my tongue. Its 6. 45am and the sun has been up a while. Balmoral shimmers under a cobalt sky. The sea is glassy the temperature in the low 20s. En route to the cone I pass over clumps of seaweed deposited by a recent storm and a small stingray etched on the bottom the ray doesnt move but I sense its eyes tracking me like swivels on an antenna base. Every few strokes I look sideways and ahead as much to avoid contact with oncoming lap swimmers as to be aware of semisubmerged figures in straw hats and sunglasses and bentarm backstrokers ploughing through the water like combine harvesters. I round the buoy and travel south a profile of Middle Head filtered through a foreground of masts opening up before me it is a quintessentially Sydney coastal scene all fingers and fists of ocean juxtaposed with bushcovered headlands. Its too early for the clanking of halyards or the reverberation of children bomb dropping off back decks all I hear is the gurgle of water as I surf the crest of my bow wave. I lift my goggles to my forehead. With my back to Middle Head I sweep 180 degrees from the megahouses along the Balmoral ridge to the cool green of Dobroyd Head across to Manlys densely urbanised isthmus and ending at the sandstone striations of North Head. As panoramas go this one is hard to beat. The solitary nature of swimming sits well with the introvert in me. I can go when I want set my own pace and be accountable to no one. I may use the time to plan or find myself equally immersed in the immediacy of my surroundings. If Ive covered territory without remembering much about it Ill know the ocean has allowed me to meditate. A small fishing craft bobs in front of Rocky Point Island two men hunch over their lines no doubt hoping for a plattersized bream flathead or tailor. Standup paddleboarders and kayakers cruise by silently. Midway up the beach a lycraclad platoon has mustered in front of the Balmoral Beach Club. This is something Ill need to consider shortly. For now its just me and the ocean. The sea may be tepid now but by the end of May it has me reaching for my wetsuit. This buys me another month in the ocean before I decamp to a heated pool for winter. All that changed in 2021. When the Covid lockdown closed public venues I thought Id be gone from the pool for a week maybe two. Id tough it out in the sea where temperatures were in the late teens. As a week became a rotation of receding horizons one thing was certain the ocean was indifferent to my needs. I bought a hooded vest and prayed that the 16C average minimum would prevail. I remember wading into the water two months into lockdown an imaginary ice cube forming between my eyes. I had not experienced 14. 5C since I was a child. How long could I last Winter does bring certain benefits. The westerlies flatten the sea and boost clarity. Looking down wavelike ripples of sand appear as defined as the ridges of a desert erg. The most obvious advantage of winter is the reduction of patrons in the noboat zone. But with nowhere else to go during the lockdown the ocean became a magnet for fugitive lap swimmers. I could measure the density of traffic in the frequency of headbutts and limb entanglement a rate far higher in those few months than at any time before. For those who worry about them the sharks have gone by May. The void is filled by jimbles cousins of the box jellyfish although they wont deliver anything more than a painful sting. On that chilly morning I passed over groups of these critters dancing across my path within touching distance of my gloveless hands the only part of my body I cannot tolerate being covered. The numbers in front of the beach club have more than doubled since I last looked. At least a quarter of the 2000strong membership seems to have turned up today.
