1,Metro Line 2A to use Charkop depot till work on Line 2B & Mandale depot is completed,"Mandale depot is right now under construction and once developed, it will be the largest Metro depot in Mumbai, with a double-decker structure.",https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/metro-line-2a-to-use-charkop-depot-till-work-on-line-2b-mandale-depot-is-completed-8347599/,The Charkop depot will be used for the trains playing on Mumbai Metro Line 2A Dahisar to DN Nagar till Metro Line 2B DN Nagar to Mandale is commissioned said an official from Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority MMRDA which is the project implementing authority. The official explained that until Metro Line 2B is ready its depot at Mandale cannot be used for Metro Line 2A. These two lines are extensions and have a common station at DN Nagar. Mandale depot is right now under construction and once developed it will be the largest Metro depot in Mumbai with a doubledecker structure. It is being developed on around 28 hectares of land which will have 76 stabling lines facility. The MMRDA Official further said that operations of Metro 2A will not be hampered as the existing Charkop depot meant for Line 7 Dahisar E to Andheri E will cater to both Metro Lines 2A and 7. The Charkop depot has a facility of 20 stabling lines. The entire operation on Metro Line 2A and 7 Dahisar East to Andheri East will be commissioned in January 2023 with 18 rakes. Therefore the Charkop depot will be sufficient to handle these many rakes ensuring smooth operation on both these metro lines said the official. Explaining the rationale behind shifting Metro 2A depot to Mandale the official said that Line 7A Andheri E to CSMIA is under construction and when operations on this line begin the Charkop depot will handle rakes for these two lines 77A. In fact work on Metro Line 7A is progressing in full speed and recently MMRDA diverted a 358metre long and 1. 8metre diameter sewer line which was obstructing Metro construction work. The MMRDA carried out microtunneling at an underground depth of 8 metre in a part of Bamanwada Vile Parle East which is densely populated.,"No travel advisory lifted in Minnesota counties, caution still advised",Generally Neutral,20,"issue, Difficult, lull",-,-
2,Haiti’s political crisis worsens as Senate terms expire,Expiration of 10 remaining senators' terms leaves Caribbean nation without any democratically elected institutions.,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/10/haitis-political-crisis-worsens-as-senate-terms-expire,Haitis political crisis worsens as Senate terms expire Expiration of 10 remaining senators terms leaves Caribbean nation without any democratically elected institutions. The deepening political crisis in Haiti has come into renewed focus as the countrys only remaining senators saw their terms expire overnight an alarming development in a country beset by surging gang violence and instability. The Senate was Haitis last democratically elected institution though its ranks had been reduced to just 10 after the country failed to hold legislative elections in 2019 to fill vacant seats. Those 10 senators represented a country of nearly 12 million people. But as their terms expired overnight on Tuesday the Caribbean country has been left without a single legislator in its House or Senate. Its a very grim situation Alex Dupuy a Haitianborn sociologist at Wesleyan University in the United States told The Associated Press news agency. One of the worst crises that Haiti has had since the Duvalier dictatorship. The bloody regime of JeanClaude Baby Doc Duvalier who fled the country in 1986 after succeeding his father Francois Papa Doc Duvalier marked the last time Haiti lacked elected officials. Gang violence has been on the rise in Haiti in recent months particularly after the power vacuum created by the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise who had been ruling by decree. The countrys de facto leader interim Prime Minister Ariel Henry whom Moise chose for the post just days before he was killed has faced a crisis of legitimacy with some Haitian civil society leaders urging him to hand power over to an inclusive transitional government. Henry has rejected that demand saying Haiti needs new elections to chart a path out of the overlapping crises it faces. But rights groups have questioned how a vote can be organised when instability appears to be worsening and most Haitians are living in fear of deadly violence on the streets especially in and around the capital PortauPrince. On January 1 Henry said that the Supreme Court would be restored and a provisional electoral council would be tasked with setting a reasonable date for elections but he did not offer a specific timeline. 12 En cette anne 2023 nous devrons apprendre nous faire confiance les uns les autres. Et je vous demande de me prendre au mot quand je parle de la volont de mon gouvernement de tout mettre en uvre pour reconstituer nos institutions dmocratiques. pic. twitter. comjynJKUKwTq Dr Ariel Henry DrArielHenry January 1 2023 Translation In this year 2023 we need to learn to trust each other. And I am asking you to take me at my word when I speak of my governments desire to do everything possible to reconstitute our democratic institutions. In a series of posts on Twitter Henry asked Haitians to trust each other as well as to trust that his government wants to do all it can to rebuild Haitis democratic institutions. Dupuy the professor said there currently are no checks and balances on Henrys power however. As long as that situation continues Henry is going to be behaving like a dictator he said. A spokesperson for the prime minister declined to comment to The Associated Press. The United Nations resident and humanitarian coordinator in Haiti warned in November that armed groups were terrorising residents of PortauPrince with nearly 200 murders and more than 100 kidnappings reported during the previous month. Haitian gang members also have used sexual violence including rape to instill fear in communities Ulrika Richardson said at that time. We are scared to step out of our houses said Daniel Jean 25 who sells phone chargers and other equipment in the capital. We are cornered kidnapping extortions. Gangs are killing people because we dont have ransom. Haitians have lost all trust in the democratic process Jean told AP adding that he will not vote if the same politicians and parties appear on the ballot They have more influence than the gangs. They control all the gangs. In October Henry appealed for an international armed force to be deployed to Haiti to restore order and secure a humanitarian corridor to allow fuel and water deliveries in the capital. The demand enjoyed the backing of the UN and the US but it also set off new protests with many Haitians including civil society leaders rejecting the prospect of foreign intervention. Washingtonled efforts to mount a nonUN mission led by a partner country to Haiti have stalled since then as President Joe Bidens administration so far has failed to get another nation to agree to lead such a force US media outlets have reported. The issue was expected to come up in discussions on Tuesday between Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who are meeting in Mexico City for a Three Amigos summit hosted by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.,Metro Line 2A to use Charkop depot till work on Line 2B & Mandale depot is completed,Somewhat Positive,20,"hampered, obstructing, Vile",-,-

Devils on horseback By Stevie Parle chefowner of Pastaio My grandpa would always make these at Christmas. They were my favourite bit and Id snaffle as many as possible. Try to get those big soft Agen prunes theyre amazing. You can wrap these the day before and either eat them while you are waiting for lunch or serve on the side of your goose.

Heat the oven to 200C alternatively you can cook these while your goose rests. 2. Make a pot of Earl Grey tea and soak the prunes in it for an hour longer if you didnt get Agen prunes theyre usually drier. Remove the stones and replace each with a quarter of a chestnut. 3. Wrap the chestnutfilled prunes in bacon and fit snugly in a tray. Pour in the vinegar and sprinkle with a little chilli for background heat. 4. Bake for around 10 minutes until the bacon turns crisp and the prunes are hot and tasty. Stuffed fried olives From Table for Two Recipes for the ones you love by Bre Graham DK 20 coming January. Something salty fried and finished with a spritz of fresh lemon is just how I want to start a meal. These olives are first stuffed with Gorgonzola and parsley then coated in breadcrumbs and fried until golden and crisp on the outside and soft inside. I buy them prepitted as theyre easier to stuff than trying to remove the pits yourself. Serves 2 Ingredients 45g 112oz Gorgonzola cheese cut into 12 small pieces tsp roughly chopped parsley 50g 1 heaped cup panko breadcrumbs 250ml 1 cup plus 1 tbsp flavourless oil 1 lemon cut into wedges to serve Method Put the Gorgonzola on a plate sprinkle the rosemary over then turn the cheese to coat it in the herb. Stuff the middle of each olive with a piece of parsleycoated Gorgonzola. Put the flour the egg and the breadcrumbs in separate shallow bowls. Dust each olive in the flour then dunk it into the egg followed by the crumbs until evenly coated. Repeat until all the olives are coated. Heat the oil in a heavybottomed pan over a medium heat its at the correct temperature when a breadcrumb dropped into the hot oil sizzles and turns light golden. Fry the olives in batches of four for 34 minutes until golden and crisp then drain on kitchen paper paper towels. Sprinkle the olives with salt and serve with wedges of lemon for squeezing over. Prawnstuffed chillies recipe By Amy Poon owner of Poons This classic and versatile stuffing of mashed and seasoned prawns can be used to stuff tofu aubergines okra or peppers. The mild chillies in this recipe are a particularly good match of flavour and texture. Serves 4 Time 60 minutes Ingredients 600g of prawns raw and peeled frozen is fine 1 tsp table salt 8g of potato starch plus extra for dusting 1 pinch freshly ground white pepper 10g of coriander stalks finely chopped optional plus some leaves to garnish 1 egg white 10 mild red chillies approx 12cm long 1 dash of vegetable oil For the black bean sauce tsp garlic cloves finely minced tsp fresh ginger peeled and finely minced 1 tbsp of fermented black beans salted rinsed 200ml of boiling water or chicken stock 20ml of light soy sauce 2 tsp sugar 1 tsp potato starch mixed to a paste with 2 tsp of water 1 tsp sesame oil 1 spring onion sliced Method Begin by making the prawn stuffing. Add half a teaspoon of salt to the raw prawns ensuring they are defrosted if frozen and rub them between your fingers for a few minutes to clean them. Rinse off in running water and squeeze out as much liquid as you can from the prawns using a tea towel. Begin smashing the prawns into a paste with the flat of a Chinese cleaver and break them down further with the back of the knife or blitz them into a paste using a food processor. Place the mashed prawns remaining salt pepper coriander stalks if using and potato starch into a stand mixer with a paddle attached and mix on a medium speed until the mixture is gluey. Add the egg white and mix again until the mixture is springy. Cover with cling film and place in the fridge for 1 hour. After an hour return the prawns to the mixer and mix again to ensure the moisture is consistent throughout. Cut the chillies in half and remove the seeds and white membrane. Dust the inside of each chilli half with potato starch so they are completely coated. Take a tablespoon of the prawn filling and gently smooth it into the chilli cavity. Add more filling as required but not so much that the filling spills out over the edge. Repeat until all the chillies are filled. Preheat a wok or frying pan over a medium heat. Add the oil then place the stuffed chillies prawnside down in the pan and cook for 23 minutes until the prawn mixture is cooked through. Add the garlic ginger and black beans to the pan and saut until fragrant. Add 130ml of the water or stock and bring to a simmer then add the soy sauce and sugar. Add in more stock as needed you want just enough sauce to coat all the prawns. Add the potato starch slurry to thicken the sauce and finish with the sesame oil and the chopped spring onion. Transfer immediately to a serving plate and garnish with a handful of coriander leaves. Gusbourne Estate Blanc de Blanc 2018 a perfect English sparkling to enjoy with these canapes.

Top five Minnesota weather events of 2022 The Minnesota State Climatology Office has compiled a list of the Top Five Weather Events of 2022 in Minnesota. According to the Climatology Office Votes were cast from various weather enthusiasts including the National Weather Service the University of Minnesota State agencies and Facebook followers. I was among the Minnesota meteorologists who voted this year. The final vote tally has been completed and here are the results as posted by the Climatology Office along with their narrative for each event and links to more info For the second year in a row significant drought conditions developed in Minnesota during 2022 this time in response to quickhitting and steep precipitation deficits. Unlike the previous years drought which hit northern Minnesota the hardest and peaked during late summer this one originated in southern Minnesota and escalated during the fall. As of early November 2022 the 2021 drought was the larger and worse of the two episodes in all categories. 2 Flooding in the Northland The exceedingly wet spring set the stage for historic flooding in the far north. International Falls through June 19 had 18. 53 inches which is almost two times the 19912020 normal of 9. 47 inches. Rainy Lake set a new record high level breaking the old level from 1950 and Lake of the Woods feel just short if the record level set in 1950. With 100 years of record the Pigeon River at Grand Portage set a record flow or discharge in the spring as well. 3 tie vote Mayhem A Stormy and Damaging May 2022 There were six separate weather episodes in May 2022.

Temperature trends Gain a Better Understanding of Today MPR News is not just a listener supported source of information its a resource where listeners are supported. We take you beyond the headlines to the world we share in Minnesota. Become a sustainer today to fuel MPR News all year long. Our average Twin Cities high temp is 25 degrees this time of year. Metro area highs will reach the 30s Saturday afternoon and well share 30s with roughly the southern half of Minnesota and most of western Wisconsin. Sunday highs will be in the 20s across much of northern and central Minnesota with lower 30s elsewhere in Minnesota and western Wisconsin Sunday afternoon wind chill temps will be in the teens in much of northern Minnesota with 20s in southern Minnesota Parts of northwestern Minnesota will have singledigit wind chills Sunday afternoon. Back to high temps Twin Cities metro area highs are projected to be in the lower 30s Monday and Tuesday followed by lower 20s Wednesday and Thursday then mid 20s on Friday. Winter storm to start the week Computer models show a low pressure system moving out of Colorado late Sunday night and then tracking northeastward Monday and Tuesday spreading precipitation over much of the upper Midwest. There will be mainly snow in some areas and a wintry mix of snow sleet and freezing rain in other areas. The models dont agree on the exact storm track and the temperature profile in the atmosphere Monday and Tuesday. As a result the locations for the most significant snow accumulations vary from model to model. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Global Forecast System GFS model shows the following precipitation pattern from Monday through Tuesday night The GFS model has the band of heaviest snow from southwestern and westcentral Minnesota through central Minnesota and into northwestern Wisconsin. The Twin Cities metro area would ride the southern edge of that heaviest snow band with the north metro receiving more snow than the south metro. Other forecast models shift the heavier snow band southward a bit. Check forecast updates as we get closer to Monday. This will be an impactful winter storm in many areas. 230 p. m.

Top five weather events of 2022 The Minnesota State Climatology Office has compiled a list of the Top Five Weather Events of 2022 in Minnesota. According to the Climatology Office Votes were cast from various weather enthusiasts including the National Weather Service the University of Minnesota State agencies and Facebook followers. I was among the Minnesota meteorologists who voted this year. The final vote tally has been completed and here are the results as posted by the Climatology Office along with their narrative for each event and links to more info For the second year in a row significant drought conditions developed in Minnesota during 2022 this time in response to quickhitting and steep precipitation deficits. Unlike the previous years drought which hit northern Minnesota the hardest and peaked during late summer this one originated in southern Minnesota and escalated during the fall. As of early November 2022 the 2021 drought was the larger and worse of the two episodes in all categories. 2 Flooding in the Northland The exceedingly wet spring set the stage for historic flooding in the far north. International Falls through June 19 had 18. 53 inches which is almost two times the 19912020 normal of 9. 47 inches. Rainy Lake set a new record high level breaking the old level from 1950 and Lake of the Woods feel just short if the record level set in 1950. With 100 years of record the Pigeon River at Grand Portage set a record flow or discharge in the spring as well. 3 tie vote Mayhem A Stormy and Damaging May 2022 There were six separate weather episodes in May 2022. Through June 3 there were more severe thunderstorm warnings though June 3 than any year back to when searchable records began in 1986. One of the most extreme thunderstorm wind events seen in years on Thursday May 12 2022.

14,"No adventure like a Himalayan adventure: Wrong turns on Kheerganga trek, bears and demonetisation","Amid deep gorges and spectacular peaks, from Goecha La to Kheerganga, Sandakphu to Chaukhamba, there#39;s a whole world to explore on foot, albeit on rigorous, tortuous climbs.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/travel-trends/kheerganga-sandakphu-goecha-la-no-adventure-like-a-himalayan-trek-adventure-9749161.html,A little before the sun moved behind the nearest mountain I turned around. Enough. I cursed myself having realised the dangerous hubris that led me up the wrong path having earlier taken a wrong left trail instead of the right right. I had started late at 11 am the 12odd km and 2500 ft climb up to Kheerganga I knew was a mere days hike instead of what beginners and tour operators loftily call a trek. I hadnt planned well having had a local villager at Barshaini where road ends and trail begins past the unappealing and monstrous hydel power plant draw a rudimentary trail map on a chit. And into the wilderness I was walking solo. Itd have been all good had I not lost my way. Now while turning back after two hours of tangential walking through a trail that got increasingly shrubbery blindsided too by the occasional chocolate wrapper and empty cola bottles strewn around must be those irresponsible Kheerganga trekkers I hurried. The 9700fthigh Kheerganga it cant be in the looming dusk Ill simply be happy if my headlamp returns me to the starting point Barshaini and further to the hashishaddled touristoverrun world I wanted to leave behind in Himachal Pradeshs Kasol. Suddenly in that trailless terrain richly camouflaged by midNovembers fallen dried leaves I tumbled crashing at least 15 ft. Regaining my nerves I tried crawling up but fell each time. Whats happening I rummaged through the leafy carpet to discover loose pebbles and gravel I had stepped on to a landslide zone. Battered and bruised and after dreadful minutes of trying I held on to a steadfast branch of a fallen tree. Sweating despite high Himachals November cold my parched throat sought water dry as they were from my yelling for help that never came. Somewhere during those many tumbles and struggle to crawl up on all fours the water bottle had fallen off the side perch of my backpack. Crawling back on to the trail and getting cold dark and desperate I knew I had to bivouac. Ice melt trickling down between rocks from the upper reaches solved the water crisis in my backpack I had two packets of ParleG biscuits dates and a compact sleeping bag my pocket held a lighter. Water food and fire sorted my headlamp ferreted for a giant rock or a formidable tree trunk to protect my back during the emergency nightover in the mountainous forest. But then I shuddered almost every other local person I met earlier had a bear story to tell. Realising that my lithe frame or my meagre resources will be no match to a curious onrushing bear in the Himalayan dark I dropped the idea of the bivouac and slowly trudged along in the twilight that felt ominously laden with unforeseeable dangers. Darkness though has its benefits. In this case it made the lights of Barshainis hydel power plant light up the distant horizon in a faint orange glow. The world of neon that I wanted to escape from was now my lodestar. I knew which way to head. But at a bend suddenly a crashing sound of branches from the slopes above. I hid behind a tree expecting the greedy bear to appear after all. The crashing sound again intermittently. Impatient and fatalistic I slowly crept up the bend and looked up fearfully bang in the middle of the throw of my headlamp with a sickle in hand working at cutting branches stood an elderly Himachali man. Equally agape on seeing me the man who could have been godsent to me asked incredulously Arre yahan kahan gaya Where did you go The taut tension releasing off me I could only think of saying in my halting Hindi Kho gaya. I got lost. And therein lies the story between the going losing and finding ones way is the nut graf of mans foray into the wild. Almost nothing explains this delicate equation better than highaltitude trekking. Where the motorable road ends is the point from where one treads into oneself for trekking is as much about wandering into the mind as it is about exploring unknown physical heights. At any rate it feeds into our unrest at best it exposes human fragility and vulnerability against the extremities of nature. One returns frostbitten calloused hardened and often wizened from the experience. It is also a walk away from the inanities of our modern digitised lives for trekking in its true sense also begins from where the radiating range of mobile cellular towers ends thereby leaving behind the allure of banal Instagram Reels and Facebook Stories digital marketplaces and free credit card deals. Trekking can make your mobile phone redundant except perhaps for the use of its camera to freeze earths pristine reality. In the way trekking barring overtrampled routes like the Annapurna and Everest base camps in Nepal is not hostage to shopanddine experiences and mass tourisms many consumerist trappings it is both archaic and anarchic. The upanddown and downandup of highaltitude trekking a team member told me during a particularly strenuous 11day trekking expedition to Sikkims 16210 ft Goecha La at the foot of the worlds thirdhighest peak Mount Khangchendzonga aka Kangchenjunga approximates the crests and troughs fall and rise of life itself the walk through relatively even valleys and plateaus reflecting life at a steady clip. Every gasp every deep breath every pounding of the heart on a near vertical incline could be conduit to a reintroduction with the self. Trekking Ive always felt is about journeying in. Near Goecha La at a subzero balconylike ledge near the bottom of the 21950 ft Mount Pandim facing the unblemished blinding whiteness of the Khangchendzonga our ears suddenly buzzed with a tremendous grim sound rushing down while the ground beneath vibrated. We looked up the Pandims slope to make sure if the unseen avalanche was hurtling down towards us and our certain deaths. No it was a safe distance away on the Khangchendzonga. On another occasion from Sandakhpu West Bengals highest point in the Darjeeling hills we saw the first rays of the sun trigger the first plume off the Khangchendzonga summit. These pure moments of sound rage fury and beauty I would later come to recognise as a certain stillness in motion. While on the short but prodigiously steep climb from the tortuously beautiful Chopta village in Uttarakhands Garhwal to the Tungnath Temple and Chandrashila Peak at 12110 ft a senior priest of the temple attested to the philosophical stasis that one often encounters while on the move over high Himalayan trails. As I sat at a nook overlooking deep gorges leading to spectacular peaks panting from the rigorous climb the septuagenarian priest deep creases on his forehead lined with sandalwood paste trudged slowly up a brawny horse following his every step. He was going up to the temple. I wondered why not on the horse. As long as he can hell walk the priest declared the horse being there only when his legs give up. After all it is an animal like us the priest reasoned. Up at the windswept Chandrashila summit hundreds of framed photos of people young and old plastic garlands diyas and camphor sticks lay around left behind by relatives of the deceased. It is a spot from where prayers of the bereaved travel afar. The photo frames mostly cracked and misshapen in shape it is said go under the snow in winter only to resurface with the melting summer heat. In that eerie zone of spectral beauty my eyes travelled across the gorges to the mammoth icy wall of the Chaukhambha the 23419 ft peak where amid the constant torrents of snow storms and unforgiving churn of the elements lay the undiscovered bodies of two mountaineers from Kolkata I knew through their trekker wives. Stillness within motion. Back on the Kheerganga route I found a home. The elderly Himachali gentleman who identified himself simply as Negi would hear nothing of my attempt to go back to Barshaini. I had to stay back with him that night. We walked up to his log hut in the middle of the mountain. After a dalroti dinner along with fresh warm milk from his cows Negi gave me his room and slept in the barn with his cattle. Family room he laughed while countering my protests. This was a week into November 8 2016s demonetisation move of the Indian government which overnight invalidated Indian currency notes of high value of which the farmer who lived off his land had no clue of. Neither his son who lived and worked in the plains nor the news had travelled up. I implored him to somehow get the repudiated Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes exchanged at the nearest bank. He laughed heartily before showing me his savings kept inside a small tin box in the kitchen only a handful of hundred rupee notes were bundled within. All legal tender still. I stayed back the next day and helped him water his apple trees and collect fodder for the cattle and dried branches for his fire. The following day he led me to the correct Kheerganga trail. We sat together on a rock and took a photograph using the timer on my SLR camera. His eyes welled up when we hugged before I left. Inside his embrace there was the warmth of home.,No Headline,Extremely Negative,490,"Intense, Severe, intense, intense, difficult, impossible, freezing, severe, Intense, Falls, slow, hazardous, warned, fall, freezing, Warning, Fall, lack, Moody, Warning",Hooker,"harassment, Todd, Tripp, Stanley, Hand, Hughes, Hyde, Lyman, Jones, Hanson, Douglas, Charles, Mix, Turner, Hutchinson, Clark, Deuel, Wright, Stearns, Dakota, McLeod, Scott, Lincoln, Burnett, Douglas, Price, Thurston, Burt, Colfax, Stanton, Buffalo, Dawson, Hamilton, Hall, Gosper, Nance, Merrick, Howard, Valley, Polk, Sherman, Phelps, Thomas, Keya, Boyd, Grant, Sheridan, Rock, Grant, Holt, Garfield, Wheeler, Custer, Loup, Hayes, Perkins, Chase, Keith, Logan"

17,Extreme Weather: Whiteout Conditions In Central US As Powerful Winter Storm Brings Blizzards,Six central U.S. states have been placed under Blizzard Warnings as officials warn of difficult to impossible travel conditions due to possible whiteouts.,https://www.ibtimes.com/extreme-weather-whiteout-conditions-central-us-powerful-winter-storm-brings-blizzards-3650462,Extreme Weather Whiteout Conditions In Central US As Powerful Winter Storm Brings Blizzards KEY POINTS Whiteouts make travel difficult due to no visible horizons during blizzard conditions Wind chills as low as 55 below zero is possible in parts of North Dakota Wind gusts as high as 60 mph is possible in some portions of South Dakota Forecasters are warning of a tremendously impactful winter storm that will bring blizzards into the central U. S. and trigger whiteout conditions that could be dangerous for travelers. A tremendously impactful winter storm will continue to affect large portions of the nation late this week and going into the holiday weekend. Winter weather hazards will stretch from border to border across the central and eastern U. S. the National Weather Service NWS said in its Short Range Public Discussion report published Thursday. Much of North and South Dakota have already been placed under Blizzard Warnings as well as parts of Iowa Minnesota and Northeastern Wyoming. The Weather Prediction Center WPC said residents in areas where blizzard conditions occur should also expect periodic whiteouts with near zero visibility and considerable blowing and drifting of snow. Traveling in these conditions will be extremely dangerous to at times impossible the agency warned. Whiteout conditions refer to a wintry mix of blowing snow wind drifts and high winds that result in reduced visibility according to statedelegated offroad safety information provider Offroaded. com. Due to grounds covered in snow the landscape may appear entirely white with no visible horizon making it difficult to recognize terrain variations. In North Dakota the NWS in Bismarck said it is expecting blizzard conditions to last the longest in the southeast part of the state. Officials at the NWS in Grand Forks also noted that many locations will see dangerous wind chills as low as 40 degrees to 50 degrees below zero through Sunday including Cando New Rockford Devils Lake and Forman. Over in South Dakota northwest wind gusts of up to 50 mph should be expected officials at the NWS in Sioux Falls noted. The highest winds are forecasted to hit Marshall Lake Andes Madison Pipestone Spencer Storm Lake and Windom. In Minnesota officials at the Minnesota Department of Transportation strongly discouraged traveling as weather conditions could be lifethreatening if any travelers are stranded. The office also said that most state highways have been shut down in southcentral and southwest Minnesota due to extreme weather. The NWS in Duluth also said power outages are possible through Saturday and dangerous wind chills as low as 40 degrees below zero should be expected. Officials at the NWS in Des Moines Iowa posted similar warnings noting that wind chill values between 30 degrees and 45 degrees below zero can produce frostbite in as little as 10 minutes. Meanwhile in Wisconsin the Dodgeville area is expected to get wind chills as low as 39 below zero Thursday night. North Dakota Blizzard Warning effective through 6 a. m.

18,"FMCG cos expect fewer price hikes, robust growth in 2023 despite headwinds",Industry strong enough to withstand another Covid hot for at least two quarters; global recession to have little impact; rural demand remains a concern,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/fmcg-firms-expects-less-price-hikes-low-inflation-robust-growth-in-2023-123010400822_1.html,ALSO READ Is the FMCG sector coming out of the woods TMS Ep215 IIP inflation HDFC Bank Martin Wolf moving averages Why moving averages are a must for trading model FMCG volumes recover in urban India in AprilJune decline in rural Report FMCG companies watch rural demand with bated breath as pain persists Fast moving consumer goods FMCG companies kickstart their new year with high hopes of robust growth despite rising recession fears and persisting Covid like situation globally. The companies are optimistic about the urban and rural growth in 2023 and expect less price hikes cooled off inflation and robust consumer demand. Last year the FMCG industry faced two major challenges subdued profit margins and weak rural demand which are expected to improve in this financial year say industry experts. Predicting the growth for this financial year CRISIL a research agency said that the revenue of the FMCG sector will grow at around 79 per cent this financial year compared to 89 per cent in the previous year which was driven by price hikes owing to partial passon of rising input costs. Volume growth for the sector will remain subdued owing to rising inflation and sluggish rural demand which accounts for almost 40 per cent of overall FMCG demand said Pushan Sharma director research CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics. The sector is expected to grow at the same pace in FY24 largely driven by volumes and moderating inflation. Rise could be seen in rural demand amid steady urban demand which will aid volume driven growth he added. Last year urban markets were growing steadily as postpandemic a lot of categories started coming back strongly which helped the urban markets to grow. The industry experts see robustness in urban demand to continue this year also. Urban demand would continue to grow at around 910 per cent in FY24 whereas rural demand is expected to grow at around 56 per cent for the industry Venkatesh Vijayaraghavan chief executive officer CavinKare told Business Standard. CavinKare is a Chennaibased FMCG major company. Parle Products is also optimistic about the industry growth and expects it to be better than the last calendar year as inflation has cooled off. Godrej Consumer Products also said that it is witnessing growing demand in rural India with the agrarian economy looking up. We expect gradual rural consumption recovery in 2023 driven by expected higher infrastructure spends Sameer Shah CFO at Godrej Consumer Products. Dabur also expects the rural demands revival as in the previous year the impact of inflationary pressures was more pronounced in the rural markets even as ecommerce and modern trade drove growth in rural markets said Mohit Malhotra CEO Dabur India. Urban demand growth will continue to be driven by emerging channels like modern trade and ecommerce said Malhotra. More than inflation it was volatility. We saw prices going up significantly last year. In fact in certain cases including edible oil it almost doubled wheat and sugar witnessed a significant rise in prices Mayank Shah senior category head at Parle Products said. In the coming year we expect the prices to remain stable as the recessionary trends continue globally due to which huge demand wont be coming across the globe which was a major factor for inflation Shah said. However Vijayaraghavan is concerned about rural demand as the industry has not seen a good rebound. But he is hopeful that if the January to March demand turns out to be good it will set up a trend for the year. From a rural perspective we are in a wait and watch situation as we dont see the demand bouncing back as expected said Vijayaraghavan. On the other hand Parle Products expects a robust rural demand in 2023 mainly due to the better realisation of the kharif crop. For the Q4 we are expecting around 1012 per cent growth over last year Shah said. As per CRISIL next fiscal higher minimum support prices for key rabi crops anticipation of normal monsoon and a good harvest should aid rural growth and help gradual recovery in rural demand. Easing of commodity inflation higher crop realisations ongoing government interventions and likely stimulus from the upcoming Union budget augurs well for the sector in the forthcoming calendar Marico said in its quarterly updates. Talking about price hikes trend that happened across the industry during the previous year Vijayaraghavan said that in 2024 price hikes will also come down due to softening of escalation in raw materials cost and global flurries. However the dairy industry has been hit by inflation and expects the trend to continue. In 2022 the dairy industry witnessed inflationary pressures with a multifold rise in varied input costs. This inflationled surge has been observed at both backend and operational levels and is likely to continue to affect the sector. However on account of better demand this year we anticipate a robust growth over the last fiscal year said Manish Bandlish managing director Mother Dairy. Other companies including Parag milks also expect price hikes throughout the country as seen in DelhiNCR region in recent times. As per Devendra Shah chairman of Parag Milks the dairy industry is expected to grow at around 1012 per cent. Parag Milks is expected to see around 1518 per cent yearonyear volume growth and around 20 per cent value growth Devendra Shah said. The rising threat One of the worries that loom over the FMCG industry is the rising number of Covid cases. Industry experts believe that Covid might disrupt the supply chain globally and the Indian FMCG market might face the problem because of its dependence for the rawpacking materials outside the country. However CavinKare and Godrej Consumer Products feels that the industry is in a much better position owing to past covid waves experiences. With the emergence of new variants and rising Covid cases I will say the industry is better prepared to tackle any situation and doesnt expect any major supply chain disruption Sameer Shaha said. Most of the companies have started piling up the inventories ahead of time to avoid any discontinuities. However some companies including Parle Parag milks and Mother Dairy do not anticipate any significant impact going ahead. Consumer players like CavinKare say that the industry can manage a quarter or two but beyond that it would be cost effective to manage the situation which would also be subject to the revamping of the inventories.

While it is too early to say that rural demand has revived but this is the first time demand for consumer goods have witnessed green shoots. The first fifteen days of December were slow but we have witnessed a pickup in consumption in the last fifteen days of the month said Angshu Mallick CEO of Adani Wilmar told Business Standard. He explained that farmers are now getting money in their hands. Also the upcoming wedding season in January has caused demand to improve as caterers part of institutional sales have also started to order. He expects the JanuaryMarch quarter to witness better demand. Parle Products which was not really impacted by weak rural demand has also seen higher growth in rural in the last one month. Rural demand was growing in the range of 34 per cent and is now in the range of 56 per cent in the last month Mayank Shah senior category head at Parle Products said. Even nonfood demand has witnessed an uptick but it is still not to the extent expected despite winter setting in. CavinKare a south based FMCG major has also seen demand improve a tad bit in rural areas in the last week. There has been a slight pickup in rural but not to the extent we were expecting in personal care. While demand has seen a pick up due the onset of winter it has not accelerated yet. However demand should see momentum in the JanuaryMarch quarter said Venkatesh Vijayaraghavan chief executive officer at CavinKare. Vijayaraghavan explained that once the cash cycle kicks in as farmers start to get money in their hands from their harvest then demand will also pick up especially in the March quarter. However according to retail intelligence platform Bizoms data for the first 20 days of the month demand was still in the negative on a monthonmonth basis and compared to last year as well. Demand was down 8. 1 per cent in the first 20 days of December compared to November while on a yearonyear basis demand was down 9. 4 per cent. Even demand for namkeens salty snacks has witnessed a demand uptick in rural areas in the last 15 days said Chandu Virani founder of Balaji Wafers.

The police said the five fraudulent fund transfers were done on Friday when the womans son attended a phone call and was told to fill up details on a link and pay Rs 2 to get their train ticket to Bhuj confirmed for January 14. An FIR was registered at Vile Parle police station on Saturday. The fraud occurred a day after MN Meena 37 had booked the ticket. The three seats booked were RAC which made Meena and her son inquire on IRCTCs Twitter handle. The fraudster called on the mobile number Meenas son had tweeted. They believed the caller without realising they had shared their ticket details and the fraudster used the same to gain their trust. We have sought details from the bank to which account the money was credited said a police officer. Around 11. 10 am Meenas son got a call from the fraudster. In the complaint Meena said My son believed the caller as the call was received some time after the complaint was tweeted on IRCTCs Twitter page. The caller claimed he was from IRCTCs customer care and assured us of getting our ticket confirmed. The person asked to fill up details after clicking on a link sent on the mobile. Bank details and other information were filled and uploaded. Later we found five transaction alerts on my mobile. We had tweeted the complaint thinking that if our RAC seats do not get confirmed we would have to travel sitting which will be difficult the FIR said. A police officer said the fraudster made the complainant pay Rs2 through her UPI. The link sent to the victims mobile stole confidential details and the PIN number to carry out the fraud. They realised they were duped when they tried to call on the same number which was found switched off said the officer.,"

The matter came to light when the SEBI Recovery Officers attempted to serve the notices of demand on these defaulters against whom the Recovery Certificates have been drawn up. Some of the defaulters who have to cough out unspecified amounts of dues are missing for the past nearly two years and some others untraceable for the past two weeks from one or multiple addresses available with the market regulator. They are MYNK1906 Industries India Ltd with three known addresses one at Vile Parle and two in south Mumbai Inducon India Ltd. with two addresses one each in south Mumbai and Andheri both untraceable since April 27 2021. Theres Classic Press International Ltd. with two addresses in Goregaon suburb but is said to be out of bounds since June 17 2021. Three others that are missing since July 19 2022 from multiple addresses are Goodearth Financial Services Ltd from Vile Parle east Aci Infocom Ltd operating from three addresses in Kandivali and three in Nariman Point and Tejoomals Industries Ltd not located at its sole address in Santacruz.

Dynavox Industries Ltd functioning from two neighbouring locations in Worli has become missing since this month December 6 2022. Welcoming the SEBI move Trade Unions Joint Action Committee TUJAC Convenor and banking expert Vishwas Utagi said that it is a matter of serious concern how these entities and the individuals connected with them have abruptly gone off the radar and must be probed. These companies are liable to pay their dues and various government taxes... If they dont come forward it will pave the way for SEBI to move other agencies and invoke relevant laws to attach and sell off these defaulters assets to recover its outstanding amounts Utagi told IANS. Admitting to the untraceable defaulters the SEBI said that it has not been able to serve the Notice of Demands on them at their last known address. The SEBI has advised these defaulters to contact the Recovery Officer Srishti Ambokar vide a letter or email within a fortnight by January 12 2023. It has also appealed to the general public that if anybody has any knowledge on the whereabouts of these defaulters they can writeemail to the Recovery Officer by the same date though in this era no telephone numbers are provided.

Also demand witnessed in the previous month compared to November was higher from tier3 cities than mega cities. Overall demand from rural areas declined 0. 2 per cent on a monthonmonth basis in December while it was down 17 per cent in November according to Bizoms data. In December the overall demand was up 1. 4 per cent on a monthonmonth basis and monthly stockings at kiranas were also up 3. 3 per cent. This came even as active kirana outlets were down 1. 8 per cent. The rural segment is also almost on a growth path as were seeing stocks get liquidated post Diwali. More importantly inflation is heading south and if that continues it could spur strong consumption in rural areas too said Akshay DSouza chief of growth and insights at Bizom. He added that demand for branded commodities and home care products have been steady as we enter the winter season. It is driven by strong stocking at kiranas especially during the last week of the month. FMCG companies also agreed that they witnessed some green shoots in rural demand in the last 1520 days of December. The first 15 days of December were slow but we have witnessed a pickup in consumption in the last 15 days said Angshu Mallick chief executive officer CEO of Adani Wilmar. He added that farmers are now getting money in their hands. Also the upcoming wedding season in January has led to improved demand as caterers part of institutional sales have also started to order. He expects the JanuaryMarch quarter to see better demand. Parle Products which was not really impacted by weak rural demand has also seen higher rural growth in the last one month. Rural demand was growing in the range of 34 per cent and is now in the range of 56 per cent during last month Mayank Shah senior category head at Parle Products said. Even nonfood demand witnessed an uptick but it is still not to the extent expected despite winter setting in. CavinKare a southbased FMCG major has seen demand improve a bit in rural areas in the last one week. There has been a slight pickup in rural demand but not to the extent we expected in personal care. Demand should see momentum in the JanuaryMarch quarter said Venkatesh Vijayaraghavan CEO at CavinKare. Vijayaraghavan added that once the cash cycle kicks in as farmers start to get money from their harvest demand will also pick up. This is especially true in the March quarter. In Bizoms data for the first 20 days of the month demand was still negative on a monthonmonth basis and compared to last year as well. Demand was down 8. 1 per cent in the first 20 days of December compared to November. On a yearonyear YoY basis demand fell 9. 4 per cent. Demand for namkeens salty snacks witnessed an uptick in rural areas during the last 15 days said Chandu Virani founder of Balaji Wafers. However DSouza said the challenge of yet another wave of Covid looms. If the previous wave is any indication FMCG businesses have found a way to work through this crisis. They will ensure steady production and distribution of stocks to kiranas DSouza said. He added With inflation lowering and businesses looking to drive consumption we can definitely hope to see more value offerings for consumers.

Tax breaks jobs or plan to beat China What will Budget 2023 offer Click to know It is definitely expected to be a populist budget and will focus on boosting both farm income through sops and incentives and reduced tax slabs that could help urban household income too Krishnarao Buddha senior category head at packaged foods company Parle Products. We also expect some tweaking in GST slabs that can make products more affordable. A year ago the budget failed to kickstart consumption despite the government allocating funds for rural jobs guarantee programmes and also through minimum support price direct payments to wheat and paddy farmers in an attempt to increase disposable income in the hands of farmers and the rural population. It will be presented at a time of ongoing geopolitical conflict and slower growth which should be kept in mind when drawing up the budget. The governments objective should be to regain the growth momentum by introducing policies that boost both consumption and net exports as components of the gross domestic product GDP said Sameer Shah chief financial officer Godrej Consumer Products Ltd GCPL. Rural markets home to more than 800 million people whose purchase behaviour is largely linked to farm output have fallen behind urban areas over the past few quarters. Dabur which gets more than half its revenues from the hinterland said rural markets continued to remain under pressure and was further accentuated by the late onset of winter in north India. The improving macroeconomic environment positive steps being taken by the government and the expected stimulus of the upcoming Union Budget should help speed up the recovery of the industry Dabur said in its preearnings update. FMCG sales grew 7 last calendar year but fell 4 in the OctoberDecember quarter according to retail analytics firm Bizom. General inflation and rainfall deficit in populous states such as Uttar Pradesh Bihar Bengal and Jharkhand remain the key challenges hurting rural disposable income analysts said. Marico too said recovery in rural demand remains a concern as inflation stays at elevated levels but easing of commodity inflation higher crop realisations ongoing government interventions and likely stimulus from the upcoming budget augurs well for the sector in the forthcoming calendar year. In the past few months companies have been reversing grammage cuts in biscuits and soaps to bolster volume growth amid easing inflationary pressures to help drive margin improvement. While growth has improved sequentially due to the festive season it is still lower than a year ago.

28,Consumer goods firms do not see any disruption from new COVID wave,"Companies selling both essentials and non-essentials said they are completely prepared to replenish stock even if there is any pantry loading by consumers, and also ensure their back-end is not impacted, executives said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/consumer-goods-firms-do-not-see-any-disruption-from-new-covid-wave/articleshow/96623585.cms,Executives of companies selling essential and nonessential goods said they are prepared if shoppers decide to stock up on supplies amid worries that the country could see another big wave of coronavirus infections. All stakeholders including the industry have learnt a lot from the past Covid waves. The disruptions had come down in every successive wave. Neither do we expect any kneejerk reaction from any stakeholder be it the government or supplier said Mayank Shah senior category head at Parle Products a leading biscuit and packaged food maker. Even in the worst case scenario consumers will surely get their daily essentials as we saw during the Omicron wave. Angshu Mallick chief executive of edible oil and staples company Adani Wilmar said any fresh Covid19 wave will not have any challenge and while retailers are stocking more that is mostly to cater to the festive occasions and marriages over the next three months. Companies said there are no signs of pantry loading yet but rumours are on about possible lockdowns in India if the country sees a Chinalike surge in Covid19 infections. At present the positivity rate and active Covid cases in India are below 1. Also more people have been queuing up for their third Covid19 vaccine shot over the last few days they said. However these companies are closely tracking retaillevel sales for any sudden surge in buying or signs that consumers are opting for large packs which could indicate pantry loading. The first two waves of Covid19 infections in India had forced some restrictions on companies selling nonessentials such as consumer electronics and smartphones and nonfood products. However such restrictions were only in a few states and in offline retail. Kamal Nandi business head of Godrej Appliances said any restriction due to Covid19 now will cripple the industry and impact consumer sentiment as sales of mass products are yet to pick up from the pandemicinduced slump. The industry is prepared with supplies unless the China Covid situation drags beyond the Chinese New Year next month in which case there would be a major component supply challenge for products like ACs in which 4045 of components are sourced from China said Nandi. Neeraj Khatri chief executive of Wipro Consumer Care India Saarc said As of now we do not expect any disruptions in the supply chain. We are also not seeing any pantry loading at least in the nonfood categories. Consumers are becoming cautiouswe are seeing some pick up in santisers category after a long time. Over the past two years consumer goods companies have seen an improvement in sales during every Covid wave as retailers bought more stocks to meet pantry loading by consumers. Rating agency Crisil expects revenue of the fastmoving consumer goods sector to grow by 79 this fiscal compared with about 8. 5 a year ago driven by price increases that were necessitated by surging input costs.

29,FMCG firms do not see any disruption from new COVID wave,"Companies selling both essentials and non-essentials said they are completely prepared to replenish stock even if there is any pantry loading by consumers, and also ensure their back-end is not impacted, executives said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/fmcg-firms-do-not-see-any-disruption-from-new-covid-wave/articleshow/96623585.cms,Executives of companies selling essential and nonessential goods said they are prepared if shoppers decide to stock up on supplies amid worries that the country could see another big wave of coronavirus infections. All stakeholders including the industry have learnt a lot from the past Covid waves. The disruptions had come down in every successive wave. Neither do we expect any kneejerk reaction from any stakeholder be it the government or supplier said Mayank Shah senior category head at Parle Products a leading biscuit and packaged food maker. Even in the worst case scenario consumers will surely get their daily essentials as we saw during the Omicron wave. Angshu Mallick chief executive of edible oil and staples company Adani Wilmar said any fresh Covid19 wave will not have any challenge and while retailers are stocking more that is mostly to cater to the festive occasions and marriages over the next three months. Companies said there are no signs of pantry loading yet but rumours are on about possible lockdowns in India if the country sees a Chinalike surge in Covid19 infections. At present the positivity rate and active Covid cases in India are below 1. Also more people have been queuing up for their third Covid19 vaccine shot over the last few days they said. However these companies are closely tracking retaillevel sales for any sudden surge in buying or signs that consumers are opting for large packs which could indicate pantry loading. The first two waves of Covid19 infections in India had forced some restrictions on companies selling nonessentials such as consumer electronics and smartphones and nonfood products. However such restrictions were only in a few states and in offline retail. Kamal Nandi business head of Godrej Appliances said any restriction due to Covid19 now will cripple the industry and impact consumer sentiment as sales of mass products are yet to pick up from the pandemicinduced slump. The industry is prepared with supplies unless the China Covid situation drags beyond the Chinese New Year next month in which case there would be a major component supply challenge for products like ACs in which 4045 of components are sourced from China said Nandi. Neeraj Khatri chief executive of Wipro Consumer Care India Saarc said As of now we do not expect any disruptions in the supply chain. We are also not seeing any pantry loading at least in the nonfood categories. Consumers are becoming cautiouswe are seeing some pick up in santisers category after a long time. Over the past two years consumer goods companies have seen an improvement in sales during every Covid wave as retailers bought more stocks to meet pantry loading by consumers. Rating agency Crisil expects revenue of the fastmoving consumer goods sector to grow by 79 this fiscal compared with about 8. 5 a year ago driven by price increases that were necessitated by surging input costs. Volume growth will however be just 12 compared with 2. 5 last year. Next fiscal too the sector should see almost a similar pace of growth but driven by volumes said Crisil which analysed 76 FMCG companies accounting for 35 of the Rs 4. 7 lakh crore annual revenue of the sector. Thats because rural demand is expected to improve with inflation gradually beginning to moderate even as urban demand will continue to remain steady.
