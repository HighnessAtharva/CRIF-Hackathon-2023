Today, more than ever, sustainability and cost-savings are top of mind for nearly every orga…",https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-sustainable-efficient-and-cost-optimized-applications-on-aws/,AWS Compute Blog Building Sustainable Efficient and CostOptimized Applications on AWS This blog post is written by Isha Dua Sr. Solutions Architect AWS Ananth Kommuri Solutions Architect AWS and Dr. Sam Mokhtari Sr. Sustainability Lead SA WA for AWS. Today more than ever sustainability and costsavings are top of mind for nearly every organization. Research has shown that AWS infrastructure is 3. 6 times more energy efficient than the median of U. S. enterprise data centers and up to five times more energy efficient than the average in Europe. That said simply migrating to AWS isnt enough to meet the Environmental Social Governance ESG and Cloud Financial Management CFM goals that todays customers are setting. In order to make conscious use of our planets resources applications running on the cloud must be built with efficiency in mind. Thats because cloud sustainability is a shared responsibility. At AWS were responsible for optimizing the sustainability of the cloud building efficient infrastructure enough options to meet every customers needs and the tools to manage it all effectively. As an AWS customer youre responsible for sustainability in the cloud building workloads in a way that minimizes the total number of resource requirements and makes the most of what must be consumed. Most AWS service charges are correlated with hardware usage so reducing resource consumption also has the added benefit of reducing costs. In this blog post well highlight best practices for running efficient compute environments on AWS that maximize utilization and decrease waste with both sustainability and costsavings in mind. Measure What Matters Application optimization is a continuous process but it has to start somewhere. The AWS Well Architected Framework Sustainability pillar includes an improvement process that helps customers map their journey and understand the impact of possible changes. There is a saying you cant improve what you dont measure. which is why its important to define and regularly track metrics which are important to your business. Scope 2 Carbon emissions such as those provided by the AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool are one metric that many organizations use to benchmark their sustainability initiatives but they shouldnt be the only one. Even after AWS meets our 2025 goal of powering our operations with 100 renewable energy its still be important to maximize the utilization and minimize the total energy consumption of the resources that you use. Thats why many organizations use proxy metrics such as vCPU Hours storage usage and data transfer to evaluate their hardware consumption and measure improvements made to infrastructure over time. In addition to these metrics its helpful to baseline utilization against the value delivered to your endusers and customers. Tracking utilization alongside business metrics orders shipped page views total API calls etc allows you to normalize resource consumption with the value delivered to your organization. It also provides a simple way to track progress towards your goals over time. For example if the number of orders on your ecommerce site remained constant over the last month but your AWS infrastructure usage decreased by 20 you can attribute the efficiency gains to your optimization efforts not changes in your customer behavior. Choose efficient purposebuilt processors whenever possible Choosing the right processor for your application is important consideration for sustainability. Thats because faster more efficient processors allow you to get the same amount of work done while using less energy. AWS has the broadest choice of processors such as Intel Xeon scalable processors AMD AMD EPYC processors GPUs FPGAs and custom ASICs for Accelerated Computing. AWS Graviton3 AWSs latest and most powerefficient processor delivers 3X better CPU performance perwatt than any other processor in AWS provides up to 40 better price performance over comparable current generation x86based instances for various workloads and can help customers reduce their carbon footprint. Consider transitioning your workload to Gravitonbased instances to improve the performance efficiency of your workload see AWS Graviton Fast Start and AWS Graviton2 for ISVs. Note the considerations when transitioning workloads to AWS Gravitonbased Amazon EC2 instances. For machine learning ML workloads using Amazon EC2 instances based on purposebuilt chips such as AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia allow you to build and run ML models using less energy and higher performance per watt than comparable GPU powered instances. Optimize for hardware utilization The goal of efficient environments is to use only as many resources as required in order to meet your needs so its important to continually validate that youre using no more hardware than required. Thankfully this is easier on the cloud because of the variety of instance choices the ability to scale dynamically and the wide array of tools to help track and optimize your infrastructure. Two of the most important tools to measure and track utilization are Amazon CloudWatch and the AWS Cost Usage Report CUR. With CloudWatch you can get a unified view of your resource metrics and usage then analyze the impact of user load on capacity utilization over time. The Cost Usage Report CUR can help you understand which resources are contributing the most to your AWS usage allowing you to finetune your efficiency and save on costs. A tool we provide which is powered by CUR data is the AWS Cost Intelligence Dashboard. The Cost Intelligence Dashboard provides a detailed granular and recommendationdriven view of your AWS usage. With its prebuilt visualizations it can help you identify which service and underlying resources are contributing the most towards your AWS usage and see the potential savings you can realize by optimizing. It even provides right sizing recommendations and the appropriate EC2 instance family to help you optimize your resources. Cost Intelligence Dashboard is also integrated with AWS Compute Optimizer which makes instance type and size recommendations based on workload characteristics. For example it can identify if the workload is CPUintensive if it exhibits a daily pattern or if local storage is accessed frequently. Compute Optimizer then infers how the workload would have performed on various hardware platforms for example Amazon EC2 instance types or using different configurations for example Amazon EBS volume IOPS settings and AWS Lambda function memory sizes to offer recommendations. For stable workloads check AWS Compute Optimizer at regular intervals to identify rightsizing opportunities for instances. By right sizing with Compute Optimizer you can increase resource utilization and reduce costs by up to 25. CloudWatch metrics are used to power Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling which can automatically choose the right instance to fit your needs with attributebased instance selection and scale your entire instance fleet up and down based on demand in order to maintain high utilization. With scheduled dynamic and predictive scaling policies based on metrics such as average CPU utilization or average network in or out. Then you can integrate AWS Instance Scheduler and Scheduled scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to schedule shut downs and terminate resources that run only during business hours or on weekdays to further reduce your resource consumption and environmental footprint. Utilize all of the available pricing models Compute tasks form the foundation of many workloads so compute infrastructure typically sees biggest benefit by optimization. Amazon EC2 provides resizable compute across a wide variety of compute instances is wellsuited to virtually every use case is available via a number of highly flexible pricing options. EC2 Spot instances are a great way to decrease cost and increase efficiency on AWS. Spot Instances make unused Amazon EC2 capacity available for customers at discounted prices. At AWS one of our goals it to maximize utilization of our physical resources. By choosing EC2 Spot instances youre running on hardware that would otherwise be sitting idle in our datacenters. Using Spot instances increases the overall efficiency of the cloud because more of our physical infrastructure is being used for meaningful work. Spot instances use marketbased pricing that changes automatically based on supply and demand. This means that the hardware with the most spare capacity sees the highest discounts sometimes up to 90 off ondemand prices to encourage our customers to choose that configuration. Because every workload has different requirements we recommend a combination of purchase options tailored for your specific workload needs. For steadystate workloads that can have a 13 year commitment using Compute Savings Plans helps you save costs move from one instance type to a newer more energyefficient alternative or even between compute solutions e. g. from EC2 instances to AWS Lambda functions or AWS Fargate. Savings Plans are ideal for predicable steadystate work. Ondemand is best suited for new stateful and spiky workloads which cant be instance location or time flexible. Finally Spot instances are a great way to supplement the other options for applications that are fault tolerant and flexible. AWS recommends using a mix of pricing models based on your workload needs and ability to be flexible. By using these pricing models youre creating signals for your future compute needs which helps AWS better forecast resource demands manage capacity and run our infrastructure in a more sustainable way. Design applications to minimize overhead and use fewer resources Regardless of your workload or technology choice using the latest generation hardware with uptodate libraries and Amazon Machine Images AMI will typically provide you the best priceperformance and performancewatt within that family. Uptodate software libraries are often required to take advantage of powersaving and performance features in modern processors and hardware such as Intels DL Boost. Taking advantage of managed services can help shift the responsibility for maintaining high resource utilization to AWS. Using managed services will help distribute the sustainability impact of the service across all of customers using that service reducing each customers individual contribution. However not all managed services are optimized by default. The following recommendations help reduce your environmental impact with automatically optimized capacity management for each manage service. Data transfer is another application design choice that has a sustainability impact. Edge computing storing and using data on or near the device it was created on reduces the amount of traffic sent to the cloud and at scale can limit energy utilization and carbon emissions. AWS Outposts AWS Local Zones and AWS Wavelength services deliver data processing analysis and storage close to your endpoints allowing you to deploy APIs and tools to locations outside AWS data centers. By processing data closer to the source edge computing can reduce latency which means that less energy is required to keep devices and applications running smoothly. Conclusion Ongoing measurement hardware utilization processor choice and application design are all critical to optimizing your AWS compute infrastructure for resource efficiency. Put simply sustainable infrastructure on the cloud uses as few resources as possible to achieve your organizations goals. In addition to your proxy metrics you can track the carbon output of your optimization journey combined with the advancements AWS makes to our infrastructure using the Customer Carbon Footprint Tool.

4,Talking Points: Where Have All The Birds Disappeared?,"Insects and moths used to be the basic food of most birds. Obviously, the number of birds that survive by feeding on insects has also decreased. This has happened due to the excessive use of pesticides in agriculture fields.",https://thehillstimes.in/featured/talking-points-where-have-all-the-birds-disappeared,By Narvijay Yadav Have you ever noticed that there are very few species of birds seen now around us The number of avian species that we used to witness threefour decades ago has decreased to an alarming level. Many species of birds have disappeared from the urban surroundings completely. One of the major reasons behind this change is the declining number of insects and moths as a heavy amount of chemical fertilizers and insecticides are used in farming. This trend is seen as a global phenomenon. It is estimated that 75 percent of insect species have been wiped out from the agriculture fields. These insects and moths used to be the basic food of most birds. Obviously the number of birds that survive by feeding on insects has also decreased. This has happened due to the excessive use of pesticides in agriculture fields. This practice not only killed the pests but also deteriorated the quality of agricultural soil. Sadhguru Jaggi the founder of the Isha Foundation travelled to many countries to create awareness about the deteriorating condition of the soil early this year. His save soil movement has gained wide acceptance globally. He says that due to overuse and exploitation of agricultural land soil has been losing its quality. The greedy tendency of humans has played a big role in spoiling the state of the environment. In the name of development more than 1. 3 million square miles of forest were cut in the last 25 years. The World Bank estimates that humans have destroyed 10 million square miles of forest since the beginning of the 20th century which has also destroyed biodiversity and is the reason behind the increase in the temperature on Earth. During the pandemic period 202021 nature in many ways attracted the attention of humans to the point that if the earth is harmed then nature has to balance in its own way. From individuals to companies governments and nations efforts have to be made at every level to save the environment. For this the Sustainable Development Goals have been issued by the United Nations. Information about this has been given in the latest report of Hurun India. According to the report 29 of Indias top 50 companies that have taken measures in this direction include ITC Infosys Cipla Adani Port Mahindra Mahindra UltraTech Cement Hindustan Zinc and Tech Mahindra. Inspired by this list other companies can step up their efforts. Many companies are constantly turning to such energy sources which cause the least harm to the environment. For this water recycling plants and solar energy plants are being set up. Adani group has planned to set up a huge air turbine in Gujarat higher than the statue of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. The turbine is believed to generate electricity enough to light up a few hundred villages in the state. By taking the green steps not only will the environment be safe but the cost of companies will also be reduced. The writer is a senior journalist and columnist.

He was speaking on the occasion of the Reliance Family Day Function.,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/years-will-roll-decades-will-pass-reliance-will-continue-to-grow-bigger-bigger-mukesh-ambani/articleshow/96588224.cms,He was speaking on the occasion of the Reliance Family Day Function. Years will roll. Decades will pass. Reliance will continue to grow bigger and bigger like the proverbial banyan tree. Its branches will spread wider its roots will go deeper and it will touch the lives of an everincreasing number of Indians enriching them empowering them nourishing them and caring for them said the Chairman. But we will forever remember with gratitude our founder who planted the seed of this Vata Vruksh fortyfive years ago. In Hindu tradition Vata Vruksh is noble it is sacred. Whenever I think of Reliance and the mission for which my father founded it I believe that there is similarly something noble and sacred about that mission he added. Mukesh Ambani said that Reliances mission is to make India prosperous by building worldclass and worldscale businesses and to bring happiness to the lives of all Indians. As you know we are living through a time when the world is beginning to see the 21st Century as Indias Century. Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji has aptly described it as Indias Amrut Kaal. The next 25 years are going to be the most transformational in the 5000yearold history of India. This is when India is poised to achieve exponential economic growth. We can become a USD 40 trillion economy by 2047 the Centenary of our Independence in a sustainable and stable manner he said. He said that this goal is realistic and achievable because India is blessed with the power of young demography mature democracy and the newly acquired power of technology. From an era of shortages scarcity and widespread poverty India will enter an era of inclusive prosperity an abundance of opportunities and unimaginable improvement in the ease of living and quality of life of 1. 4 billion Indians. Similarly at a time when uncertainty volatility and even regression can be seen in many parts of the world India is being regarded globally as a Shining Spot. Therefore I would like every leader and every employee in Reliance to know that destiny has given us an opportunity and also a responsibility to make a pivotal contribution to the realisation of the enormous promise of Indias Amrut Kaal Mukesh Ambani said. The Chairman said that Reliance has embarked on a journey of comprehensive selftransformation. The end of 2022 is when Reliance will have crossed the halfway mark of its Golden Decade. In five years from now Reliance will complete its fifty years. All of us are proud of what we have achieved so far. But the journey ahead is going to be far more exciting more rewarding but also more challenging he said. Lauding son Akash Ambani for rolling out 5G network across India he said Under Akashs Chairmanship Jio is rolling out the worlds best 5G network across India at a pace which is faster than anywhere in the world. Jios 5G deployment will be complete in 2023. I heartily congratulate the entire Jio Team for further consolidating the Number 1 position in the digital connectivity business. But Jio Platforms should now get ready for Indias next big opportunity to provide unique digital products and solutions to both domestic and international markets. Mukesh Ambani assured that no Indian will be deprived of access to highquality education highquality healthcare and highproductivity economic activities. Since every single village will have 5G connectivity India has a historic opportunity to completely erase the ruralurban divide which has plagued our country for so long. We can now ensure that no Indian will be deprived of access to highquality education highquality healthcare and highproductivity economic activities he added. The Reliance Chairman further said that under daughter Isha Ambani Retail business has grown rapidly. It has emerged as one with the widest and deepest reach in India across all product baskets. Most significantly Reliance Retail has created over two lakh new jobs last year becoming one of Indias leading employers. I congratulate the Retail Team for setting new standards in disciplined execution which is the key to its success. But I know that all of you in the Retail Team is capable of chasing even more ambitious targets and goals he said. Mukesh Ambani said that like Jio the growth of the Retail business will also have a cascading effect on Indias inclusive development. Our young people will have more jobs. Our farmers will have higher incomes. Our SMEs and large manufacturers will become more productive. And our traderpartners will become more prosperous he added. He said We continue to build on our leadership in the O2C business with new capacities and capabilities. In the EP Segment our team continues to work harder for providing energy security for India he added. He said that New Energy is Reliances newest startup business with the potential to transform not just the company or the country but the entire world. It shows that we care for the planet and we care for all the people on the planet. With Anant joining this upcoming NextGen business we are making rapid progress in getting our Giga Factories in Jamnagar ready. From being Indias largest and most valuable corporate Reliance is now well on its way to also becoming Indias Greenest corporate. The goals before our New Energy Team are crystal clear said the Chairman. Mukesh Ambani said that 2023 will also be a Year of Renewal and Revitalisation for Reliance Foundation. Under Nitas inspiring leadership Reliance Foundation is working on even more ambitious new initiatives in education healthcare sports womens empowerment and ecological conservation he said. When I look at the state of the world today at the global financial landscape technological landscape and supply chain landscape I instinctively feel that we are going to see profound astonishing and unexpected changes in the coming decade. I can clearly see India riding this tsunami of changes and achieving what looked impossible earlier. Therefore as Indias leading corporate Reliance has to rise to the call of times and fulfil the nations expectations. To be able to do so Reliance has begun implementing two important tasks he said. First we are empowering Reliance with new leadership capital especially with young leadership. Second we are enriching Reliance with new talent capital again with young talent. We will pay a lot of attention to developing capacity capability and competence at all levels he added.

9,‘I Lost 58 Kg by Running & Eating Clean’: Fitness Coach Shares His Mantra,"Bengaluru resident Shreyas Karnad, who went from being 120 kg to 62 kg in three years, dedicates his accomplishment to clean eating habits and running. Here’s how he quit his job to turn into a coach with his initiative, Runners 360.",https://www.thebetterindia.com/308047/how-to-start-running-coach-shreyas-karnad-fitness-weight-loss-journey-bengaluru/,In 2012 Shreyas Karnad had a startling revelation one morning when he weighed himself. The scale indicated he was 62 kg. This was a milestone accomplishment for the then 25yearold who just three years ago weighed 120 kg. While he was thrilled at the weight transformation he decided not to stop working on himself and transform his life with exercise and clean eating habits. While Shreyas says running was something that greatly contributed to his weight management he says he found a kind of solace in the sport. I loved running and would often think of how nice it would be to turn it into a profession he recounts in conversation with The Better India. Today ten years later Bengalurubased Shreyas is living the dream. Through Runners 360 the initiative Shreyas started to coach people of all ages and backgrounds in running and fitness he is making his contribution to the world. I always wanted to be a coach As Shreyas recounts he fell in love with running once he started. At the time he was working in Singapore and would often visit a few running coaching classes. The beauty of these classes was that irrespective of the ages and backgrounds of the people who came here everyone ran together. There were no barriers people would just run. Thats when it hit me that the sport was beautiful and that it brought people together. I wanted to do something like this he says. That same year Shreyas returned to India and began working with a content development firm. He continued to run on the side. In 2015 I remember doing a 700 km bicycle trip cycling from Bengaluru to Mysuru an activity that Isha Vidhya set up to raise funds for education in rural India. Later that year they asked me to come to Coimbatore and train the monks associated with Isha Foundation in running and fitness. I agreed notes Shreyas. However following this he met with a bike accident and was confined to his bed for months on end a period that he recalls as being one of the toughest. He had severe pain and back issues. I began doing a lot of thinking during this time. The time I spent in my bed gave me space to think that if I hadnt survived the accident would I have been content with the life that I had lived Had I harnessed my uniqueness in the world It was during the same time that Shreyas pondered on how happy running made him and when he was better and Isha Foundation was having another event in Bengaluru in 2016 he joined in taking a sabbatical from work for the same. This was where I began coaching people professionally in running guiding them on how to warm up how much they needed to run etc he says. He adds that the next assignment he got was in Karwar where he had to get 2000 people to run on the beach. Following the adrenaline of this event Shreyas was faced with a tough thought Did I want to go back to corporate life or continue doing this I decided to quit my job Shreyas chose the latter. I started coaching and travelling across India doing workshops in running and engaging in community building through these workshops. Its a beautiful feeling he says. To see peoples journeys and their commitment and dedication is amazing. Through my coaching I have realised that often we have preconceived notions about people. Mindset is all you need to run there is no age barrier. Shreyas elaborates that through Runners 360 they train IAS officers CFOs and even people who come from modest backgrounds. Over the last seven years we have coached over 1000 people. We want to help people run better. We want them to refine their technique and empower them with the right mindset he says. As the 36yearold looks back on the journey he has had he says it has been filled with change and positivity. The beauty of my journey is that it is not simply a story of losing weight. It is a story of transforming my life and then sharing it with others looking to transform theirs he says.
