1,Investigation: Many U.S. hospitals sue patients for debts or threaten their credit,An examination of billing policies and practices at more than 500 hospitals across the country shows widespread reliance on aggressive collection tactics.,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/12/21/1144491711/investigation-many-u-s-hospitals-sue-patients-for-debts-or-threaten-their-credit,Investigation Many U. S. hospitals sue patients for debts or threaten their credit Despite growing evidence of the harm caused by medical debt hundreds of U. S. hospitals maintain policies to aggressively pursue patients for unpaid bills using tactics such as lawsuits selling patient accounts to debt buyers and reporting patients to credit rating agencies a KHN investigation shows. The collection practices are commonplace among all types of hospitals in all regions of the country including public university systems leading academic institutions small community hospitals forprofit chains and nonprofit Catholic systems. Individual hospital systems have come under scrutiny in recent years for suing patients. But the KHN analysis shows the practice is widespread suggesting most of the nations approximately 5100 hospitals serving the general public have policies to use legal action or other aggressive tactics against patients. And although industry officials say they are careful about how they target patients for unpaid bills few institutions have renounced what federal rules call extraordinary collection actions even as medical debt forces millions of Americans to cut back on food and other essentials drain retirement savings and make other difficult sacrifices. At the same time a majority of hospitals scrutinized by KHN effectively shroud their collection activities publicly posting incomplete or in many cases no information about what can happen to patients if they cant pay. These are among the findings of an examination of billing and financial aid at a diverse sample of 528 hospitals across the country. Over the past year KHN investigated each of these hospitals reviewing thousands of pages of policies and other documents. The reporting also included thousands of telephone and email inquiries and interviews to obtain and clarify how hospitals handle patients with unpaid bills. Loading... Some hospitals did not respond to multiple requests for information. But KHN was able to gather details about most. From them a picture emerges of a minefield for patients where a trip to the hospital can not only produce jawdropping bills but also expose patients to legal risks that jeopardize their livelihood. Among the findings More than twothirds sue patients or take other legal action against them such as garnishing wages or placing liens on property A similar share of the hospitals report patients with outstanding bills to credit rating agencies putting patients credit scores and their ability to rent an apartment buy a car or get a job at risk A quarter sell patients debts to debt collectors who in turn can pursue patients for years for unpaid bills About 1 in 5 deny nonemergency care to people with outstanding debt Nearly 40 of all hospitals researched make no information available on their websites about their collection activities although KHN in some cases was able to obtain the information through repeated requests. People dont know whats going to happen to them. It can be terrifying said Tracy Douglas a consumer attorney at Bet Tzedek Legal Services in Los Angeles. Douglas described one older woman she worked with who was afraid to seek financial assistance from a hospital because she worried the hospital would seize her home if she couldnt pay. Taken aback by how callous they have been The impact of these collection practices can be devastating. Across the U. S. health care system medical debt is taking a fearsome toll on patients forcing more than half of adults with healthrelated debt to make difficult sacrifices including taking on extra work changing their living situation or delaying their education a KFF poll conducted for this project found. Basit Balogun was a freshman at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania when a heart attack caused by a previously undetected birth defect landed him in the hospital. Because his insurance had lapsed Balogun whose family is from Nigeria was hit with bills amounting to tens of thousands of dollars. When he couldnt pay the hospital reported him to a credit agency which he discovered only after hed graduated and was trying to rent an apartment in New York City. I kept getting rejected and rejected Balogun recalled. I was desperate. Balogun a prizewinning student landed a job at banking giant Goldman Sachs and used his signing bonus to begin paying down the debt. Five years later hes still making payments. Now Balogun said he thinks twice before going to the doctor. Nick and Elizabeth Woodruff also had their faith shaken by hospital debt collectors. Nick was sued by Our Lady of Lourdes Memorial Hospital in Binghamton New York where hed received care for a dangerous foot infection. Despite having insurance through Nicks work at a truck dealership the couple were buried in bills forcing them to withdraw money from their retirement accounts and borrow from family. When they still couldnt make all the payments the hospital a Catholic institution owned by the Ascension chain took them to court and in 2018 they were ordered to pay more than 9300. This hospital boasts Catholic values and states they take pride in their charity work said Elizabeth a social worker but I am taken aback by how callous they have been. Ascension spokesperson Nick Ragone told KHN that the chain Americas secondlargest Catholic system ceased taking legal action against patients for unpaid bills starting in October 2019. But New York court records show that Lourdes continued to file legal actions against patients until at least 2021. Hospital spokesperson Lisa Donovan subsequently told KHN this was an administrative oversight. Lourdes is reviewing matters to ensure that all legal activities have been disposeddismissed she said in an email. Holes in the charity care system Many hospital officials say they are obligated to collect what patients owe. We dont want to promote the concept that medical bills just go away especially for those who are able to pay said Michael Beyer who oversees patient accounts at Sanford Health a South Dakotabased nonprofit with clinics and hospitals across the U. S. and abroad. Hospital leaders also stress the industrys commitment to helping lowincome patients and others who cant pay their bills. Hospitals are doing a lot said Melinda Hatton general counsel at the American Hospital Association. Is it perfect out there No. But I think they should get credit for trying pretty hard. Charity care is offered at most U. S. hospitals. And nonprofit medical systems must provide financial aid as a condition of not paying taxes a benefit that saves the industry billions of dollars annually. At many medical centers however information about financial assistance is difficult or impossible to find. About 1 in 5 hospitals researched by KHN including public university systems in five states dont post aid policies online. The University of Mississippi Medical Center disclosed its policy only after KHN filed a public records request. Many hospitals prominently place a link on their homepages for patients to pay a bill but then require people to click through multiple pages to find information about financial aid. Visitors to the website of Opelousas General Health System in Louisiana who click on the Patient Resources tab can learn that the Lil General Caf serves panini and pancakes but they wont find any information about getting help with medical bills. Applying for aid can also be extremely complicated requiring patients to produce exhaustive amounts of personal financial information KHN found. Standards vary widely with aid at some hospitals limited to patients with income as low as 13590 a year. At other hospitals people making five or six times that much can get assistance. About twothirds of the hospitals researched by KHN require patients to report their assets sometimes in great detail. CenturaSt. Anthony Hospital a Catholic medical center in suburban Denver notes in its policy that in reviewing patient assets it may count crowdfunding or social media accounts patients have set up to help pay bills. Other hospitals ask patients to report the make model and year of cars they have. The system doesnt work said Jared Walker founder of Dollar For a nonprofit that has helped thousands of people across the country apply for financial aid. Patients cant find the information they need. Half the time when they do apply for assistance they never hear back. Basically hospitals do what they want and there is no accountability. Sent to collections or sued In many cases patients who should qualify for assistance are instead targeted by bill collectors whether by accident or by design. Every week or so we get a call from someone who should have qualified for aid but they werent enrolled said Michele Johnson executive director of the nonprofit Tennessee Justice Center. A 2019 KHN analysis of hospital tax filings found that nearly half of nonprofit medical systems were billing patients with incomes low enough to qualify for charity care. Earlier this year Washington state sued hospitals belonging to the nonprofit giant Providence after uncovering that the system trained its collectors to aggressively pursue even patients who should have qualified for aid. In 2017 the state also successfully sued CHI Franciscan another Catholic system that authorities found wasnt properly offering charity care. To settle that case CHI Franciscan now part of the mammoth CommonSpirit Health chain provided more than 40 million in debt relief and refunds and helped patients repair their credit according to the state attorney generals office. But CommonSpirit hospitals still report patients to credit rating agencies according to the chains published policies. Credit reporting a threat that is supposed to induce patients to pay is the most common collection tactic KHNs analysis and other data shows. Fewer patients are actually taken to court. But more than twothirds of policies obtained by KHN allow hospitals to sue patients or take other legal actions against them such as garnishing wages or placing liens on property. This includes half the hospitals earning top spots on the U. S. News World Reports annual scorecard medical centers such as the Mayo Clinic Cleveland Clinic and Massachusetts General Hospital. Patients at public university medical systems in at least 23 states including Colorado Georgia Minnesota Tennessee and Wisconsin can be sued. In several states including North Carolina Ohio and New York public university systems refer patients to other state agencies for legal action or withholding tax refunds. Major nonprofit systems such as Kaiser Permanente Trinity Health and Northwell Health will also take legal action against patients according to their policies or spokespeople. Americas largest forprofit hospital chains HCA Healthcare and Tenet Healthcare dont post collection policies but dont sue patients according to spokespeople. Other investorowned chains such as Community Health Systems will take patients to court. Hospitals with policies allowing them to sue patients tend to have only slightly higher profits than those that dont sue KHN found by comparing financial data that hospitals submit annually to the federal government. The same is true of hospitals that sell patient accounts a practice in which medical providers typically package a group of outstanding bills and sell them to a debtbuying company usually for a small percentage of what is owed. Debt buyers then keep whatever they can collect. Officials at many hospitals that sue say they rarely take that step. And spokespeople at several medical systems said they have effectively stopped taking patients to court even if their policies still allow it. But in many cases hospital policies havent changed leaving patients in legal jeopardy as was the case at the Ascension hospital in New York that continued to file lawsuits against patients. The effect of barring aggressive collections A few hospitals have barred all aggressive collections including two of Californias leading academic medical centers at UCLA and Stanford University. So too have the University of Vermont Medical Center and Ochsner Health a large New Orleansbased health system. That can make a difference for patients data suggests. A recent analysis by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that while medical debt is widespread across the Appalachian region one notable exception is western Pennsylvania. Residents there have fewer pastdue medical bills on their credit reports than the national average. This region is dominated by the Pittsburghbased UPMC hospital system which prohibits aggressive collection actions including reporting patients to credit agencies. In neighboring West Virginia by contrast the incidence of medical debt is more than 50 above the national average the CFPB found. That states largest hospital system operated by West Virginia University not only reports patients to credit agencies but will also sue patients garnish their wages and place liens on property. Elected officials in some states have begun to put limits on hospital bill collecting. In 2021 Maryland barred hospitals from placing liens on patients homes and protected lowincome patients from wage garnishments. California recently restricted when hospitals could sell patient debt or report patients to credit bureaus. But these states remain the exception. And hospitals that have voluntarily given up aggressive collections are in the minority Just 19 of the 528 hospitals researched by KHN have publicly posted policies barring extraordinary collection actions. Mark Rukavina who spent decades at the nonprofit Community Catalyst working to expand protections for patients with medical debt said that is why federal action is needed to rein in hospitals and other medical providers everywhere. Nobody should be denied care because they have an outstanding medical bill he said. Nobody should have a lien on their home because they got sick. Researchers who worked on this story include KHN writer Megan Kalata and Dr. Margaret Ferguson Anna Back and Amber Cole who were students at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.

2,"Reliance on hi-tech solutions to climate crisis perpetuates racism, says UN official","Rapporteur Tendayi Achiume says projects are at expense of marginalised groups and Indigenous peoplesThe world’s reliance on hi-tech capitalist solutions to the climate and ecological crises is perpetuating racism, the outgoing UN racism rapporteur has warned…",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/27/reliance-on-high-tech-solutions-to-climate-crisis-perpetuates-racism-says-un-official,The worlds reliance on hitech capitalist solutions to the climate and ecological crises is perpetuating racism the outgoing UN racism rapporteur has warned. Green solutions including electric cars renewable energy and the rewilding of vast tracts of land are being implemented at the expense of racially and ethnically marginalised groups and Indigenous peoples Tendayi Achiume told the Guardian in an interview. In a last intervention before the end of her tenure Achiume said meaningful solutions to the ecological crisis were not possible without tackling racism. But in a bleak assessment of the prospects for the future of humanity she admitted it was difficult to imagine how that message could be made to resonate with people holding power. You cant think that you solve the climate crisis and then attend to racial justice or racial discrimination Achiume said. What you have to realise is that every action that is taken in relation to ecological crisis environmental climate and otherwise has racial justice implications and so every action becomes a site of undoing racial subordination. Achiume a professor of law at the University of California Los Angeles was appointed as the UNs special rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism racial discrimination xenophobia and related intolerance in 2017 becoming the first woman and the first person from southern Africa to fill the role. Her public comments have often been deemed controversial. On her first country visit as rapporteur to the UK she provoked the fury of the right by warning of a Brexitrelated rise in bigotry and calling for a repeal of hostile environment immigration policies. She went on to deliver similarly strong comments to the governments of Morocco the Netherlands and Qatar decrying the latter for operating a de facto caste system based on national origin. In her reports she has outlined how the extraction of natural resources emerging digital technologies and even global development frameworks were fuelling racial injustices and the need for reparations for slavery and colonialism. In her final report to the UN general assembly in October she tackled the relationship between racism and the climate and ecological crises. It was she said an issue that had been raised from the very beginning of her tenure as one of the most important global factors in racial injustice. The global ecological crisis is simultaneously a racial justice crisis she wrote in the report. The devastating effects of ecological crisis are disproportionately borne by racially ethnically and nationally marginalised groups Across nations these groups overwhelmingly comprise the residents of the areas hardest hit by pollution biodiversity loss and climate change. This climate justiceoriented perspective demands antiracist solutions Achiume said. But the very same structures that created racial inequalities were now being relied upon to solve the environmental crisis leading to a doubling down on racial inequality and injustice. The rush towards sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels including electric cars and renewable energy was creating what Achiume described as green sacrifice zones where already marginalised groups were exposed to environmental harms from the extraction of the very minerals needed for green tech. The transition to electric cars for example implied a onetoone substitution of vehicles without accounting for the environmental impact of electric vehicles and where the minerals and all of the materials that are required to produce electric vehicles are coming from she told the Guardian. Indigenous communities and racially marginalised communities are being displaced by innovations that are supposed to be leading us towards clean energy she added. And there you see how a green transition unless it explicitly centres racial justice can come at the expense of and reproduce these sorts of racial injustices. These problems were being caused by an approach that thinks the solution to the environmental crisis could simply be a more concerted application of the global capitalist framework Achiume said. This meant that the very companies that had build their wealth from the destruction of the environment and from racial injustices were now being relied on to try to reverse the damage. Were basically again trying to profit our way out of a crisis that is defined by an approach that thinks that profiting out of crisis is sustainable she said. After Achiumes final report was filed to the UN general assembly in October delegates at the Cop27 climate change summit in Egypt agreed to a loss and damage fund to help underdeveloped countries adapt to climaterelated disasters. These provisions were a positive step and even a way of forcing some engagement with reparations Achiume said. I see it as a wedge you know a way in the door and a way to create space for accountability for the historic injustice that brings us to this moment of the climate crisis. But she added I worry that the way that that loss and damage fund will be set up will actually be done to undermine what is actually required and what is being demanded by the countries that are pushing for a loss and damage framework. So the danger here is that well see what weve seen in the past a gain is made and then that gain becomes a site for a doubling down on the mechanisms that actually keep us trapped in the problem rather than moving us forward. Such groups are already suffering the brunt of climate breakdown and environmental harms she said. Now they have been left the passive recipients of whatever solutions have been decided on by leaders from the global north. In consultations with Indigenous groups and also with racially and ethnically marginalised groups they talk about how they are takers rather than makers of the environmental and climate policies that affect their day to day Achiume said.,Investigation: Many U.S. hospitals sue patients for debts or threaten their credit,Extremely Negative,1400,"sue, debts, threaten, harm, debt, debt, commonplace, aggressive, debt, drain, difficult, shroud, incomplete, risks, jeopardize, sue, risk, debts, debt, deny, debt, afraid, worried, callous, devastating, debt, fearsome, toll, debt, difficult, delaying, defect, lapsed, rejected, rejected, desperate, debt, debt, sued, dangerous, infection, callous, oversight, stress, hard, difficult, impossible, complicated, limited, sued, sued, sued, debt, threat, sue, sued, sue, sue, sue, Debt, sue, jeopardy, aggressive, aggressive, debt, aggressive, debt, sue, limits, restricted, debt, aggressive, minority, debt, denied, issues, issues",sick,"lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit, Tracy, Douglas, lawsuit, Douglas, Basit, Balogun, Balogun, Balogun, Balogun, Balogun, Nick, Elizabeth, Woodruff, Nick, Elizabeth, Nick, Ragone, lawsuit, lawsuit, Lisa, Donovan, lawsuit, Michael, Beyer, Melinda, Hatton, Jared, Walker, Michele, Johnson, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit, Mark, Rukavina, Megan, Kalata, Margaret, Ferguson, Anna, Back, Amber, Cole"

OL and RWE RWEG. DE said on Thursday they plan to develop a supply chain for lowcarbon hydrogen allowing Germany to cut its reliance on coal power and thus its CO2 emissions. The two companies plan to build power plants in Germany that will initially be fuelled by natural gas and later with hydrogen made in Norway at jointly constructed production facilities. The joint investments are contingent on a hydrogen pipeline currently under consideration by Equinor Norwegian gas system operator Gassco and other partners that is aimed at connecting Norway and Germany and is expected to start deliveries in 2030. The companies did not provide details about their financial commitments though RWE Germanys top power producer said the partnership would cover investments worth several billions of euros. But it is too early to go into detail. First of all the infrastructure needs to be built and a suitable political framework needs to be established the company said. Equinor CEO Anders Opedal told Reuters the cost of the total supply chain could run into the tens of billion euros. The pipeline if it went ahead would cost 3 billion euros alone and would be the first of its kind worldwide he said. It could transport 4 million tonnes of hydrogen per year he said equivalent to 135 terawatt hours of energy similar to total Norwegian hydropower production. So its a massive amount of energy that can go through this pipeline he said. That also creates the infrastructure between Norway and Germany where hydrogen from renewables can be added over time because this kind of infrastructure has a long lifetime. The project will initially supply socalled blue hydrogen made from gas. This will be subject to carbon capture and storage which Equinor and RWE said in a joint statement would bury more than 95 of the associated emissions. Longer term the companies aim to produce green hydrogen from renewable sources such as offshore wind turbines thus cutting emissions further. The partnership reflects Germanys efforts to diversify away from Russian gas supplies of which have stopped in the wake of the Ukraine war something that has proved tricky as gasproducing nations have limited scope to ramp up production. Norway has since last year overtaken Russia as Europes biggest gas supplier with statecontrolled Equinor the top exporter. During a visit to Norway by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz last August aimed at extracting more commitments Norways Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said the countrys deliveries were at a maximum. There is an urgent need for a rapid rampup of the hydrogen economy RWE Chief Executive Markus Krebber said in the statement. Blue hydrogen in large quantities can make a start with subsequent conversion into green hydrogen supply he said. Germany is planning multiple hydrogen import projects with several of the countrys new import terminals for liquefied natural gas LNG also readying to receive hydrogen at a later stage. This story has been corrected to specify that the hydrogen pipeline is under consideration by Equinor Gassco and other partners in paragraph 3.

</li><li>Prime…",https://globalnews.ca/news/9403453/trudeau-three-amigos-semiconductors-north-america/,Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday he will push to ensure Canada plays a vital role in North America becoming a reliable supplier of semiconductors to the global economy yet admitted that role is still somewhat to be determined. Trudeau made the comments following the North American Leaders Summit with U. S. President Joe Biden and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico City where the socalled Three Amigos agreed to boost semiconductor output and investment in the continent to compete with Asia which has dominated the industry. The world has realized that an overreliance on any one region for semiconductors will have dire consequences on the economy that were building for the future he said. Canada has a significant role to play in the semiconductor industry. What exactly that role is is still somewhat to be determined. Read more Canada U. S. Mexico pledge to tighten economic ties boost domestic production Read next Kanye West reportedly marries Yeezy designer Bianca Censori He pointed to the semiconductor assembly plant in Bromont Que. one of the largest such facilities in North America and a key supplier for tech giants like IBM as one area where Canada can contribute. The federal governments new critical minerals strategy unveiled last month is designed to supply the resources needed to build increasingly important semiconductors that are used in everything from telecoms to electric vehicles and defence. Our focus is on making sure that Canada and Canadians are a part of the semiconductor ecosystem Trudeau said. He added that Canadas contributions to the North American auto industry not just building vehicles but also various parts that are assembled elsewhere provides an economic model that can be replicated for semiconductors. COVID19fuelled lockdowns in semiconductor manufacturing centres like China and Taiwan led to a global shortage of microchips that is still being felt in the automotive and electronics industries among others. The pandemic along with Russias war in Ukraine that impacted energy supplies for Europe has led to Canada and other Western countries looking elsewhere around the world for strategic partnerships to avoid overly relying on single countries or regions for crucial industries particularly disruptive nations like Russia and China. The North American strategy agreed to this week will see a semiconductor forum organized for early 2023 to increase investment across all three countries. Trudeau said conversations being had with North American partners and elsewhere regarding critical minerals and semiconductors are geared towards agreements that are still months and even years away with nothing concrete having been agreed to during his time in Mexico City. The reception that weve seen from Canadas critical minerals strategy has been overwhelmingly positive he said. When we have great announcements to make we make them. Mexicos hopes of benefiting from the push to boost semiconductor output have been undermined by an ongoing dispute over Lopez Obradors nationalist energy policies with Washington and Ottawa starting formal dispute settlement proceedings in July. The spat which centres on Mexicos efforts to give priority to its cashstrapped staterun energy companies at the expense of private foreign investors was being closely watched at the summit. Trudeau said the issue was discussed and that Lopez Obrador was receptive to his and Bidens concerns. Read more Tensions between U. S. Mexico on full display as Three Amigos summit opens Read next Here are North Americas most punctual airlines. No Canadian carriers made the list Trudeau dismissed the idea that Lopez Obrador is a trade skeptic saying the Mexican president was extremely positive about Canadian trade and investment in Mexican energy. Earlier Wednesday following a bilateral meeting with Trudeau Lopez Obrador pointed to TC Energys investment in the 4. 5 billion Southeast Gateway Pipeline that would bring natural gas to southeastern Mexico as a significant example of successful Canadian investment. The pipeline is part of an overall strategy for Lopez Obradors government to lure foreign investment to its south from the northern frontier region where it clusters for easy access to the United States. On the more contentious issue of electricity where Mexico is also being accused of limiting foreignbuilt plants Lopez Obrador said he told Trudeau that he would meet with Canadian companies that have complaints with his administrations policies. The CanadaU. S. Mexico free trade agreement known as CUSMA prohibits favouring domestic companies over those from other member states. Read more Canada and Mexico win trade dispute with U.

Thats what this particular gathering has been entirely focused on understanding that the three of us working together are an extraordinarily competitive continent that can take on the world he said. Trudeau will head right from the Mexico City summit to meeting with another key ally Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Ottawa on Thursday. Japan is similarly trying to pivot away from a reliance on China and Russia for electricity and food echoing comments made by Trudeau and other leaders in recent weeks. There is a risk involved in relying excessively upon a single country economically and we now fear that risk more intensely than ever Japanese trade minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told a Washingtonbased think tank last week.

9,Taliban use water cannon on women protesting education order in Afghanistan,"A group of women took to the streets in the city of Herat in Afghanistan on Saturday, protesting against a Taliban order this week suspending all female students from attending university in the country.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/25/middleeast/afghan-women-street-protest-taliban-education-intl-hnk/index.html,A group of women took to the streets in the city of Herat in Afghanistan on Saturday protesting against a Taliban order this week suspending all female students from attending university in the country. Video footage circulating on social media showed Taliban officials using a water cannon to disperse the female protesters. Girls could be seen running from the water cannon and chanting cowards at officials. The Talibans announcement this week that it was suspending university education for female students was its latest step in an ongoing clampdown on the freedoms of Afghan women. The move came despite the group promising when it returned to power last year that it would honor womens rights. It follows a similar move in March this year that barred girls from returning to secondary schools. Male students in universities across the country have responded to the latest education ban by boycotting their exams in protest. Education is the duty of men and women read a statement from the Mirwais Nika Institute of Higher Education in Kandahar issued Saturday. It is the fundamental right and secret of the countrys development and selfreliance. Students had first asked Taliban officials to reverse the ban but no positive response was given the school said adding that dissatisfaction and unhappiness fueled the boycott. One university official told CNN that the students decision to boycott their admissions exams would lead to classes being put on hold. The Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021 in a lightning takeover following the withdrawal of US troops having previously ruled the country from 1996 until 2001 when the USled invasion forced the group from power. Under its previous period of rule the group was notorious for its treatment of women as secondclass citizens. After seizing power last year the group made numerous promises that it would protect the rights of women and girls. But activists say the Taliban have reneged on their word and are steadily chipping away at womens freedoms once again. On Saturday the group ordered all local and international nongovernmental organizations NGOs in the country to stop female employees from attending work. Noncompliance would result in the revoking of NGO licenses an official ministry notice read. A spokesman told CNN the move was due to the nonobservation of Islamic dress rules and other laws and regulations of the Islamic Emirate. Afghan women can no longer work in most sectors. Their travel rights have also been severely restricted and access to public spaces significantly curtailed. Women are also required to fully cover themselves in public including their faces.,Fitch affirms India at 'BBB-' with stable outlook,Extremely Positive,30,"fall, gloomy, declining, slow",-,-
10,Disney accused of squeezing theme park customers,Investor Nelson Peltz says price rises at Disney's theme parks are unsustainable.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64255871,Disney accused of squeezing theme park customers Published Disney is facing criticism from a highprofile investor that is unusual in the business world that it is squeezing money out of its theme park customers. The firms reliance on raising ticket prices and other charges to drive growth is unsustainable says Trian Partners boss Nelson Peltz. He made the claim in a presentation calling for change at the media giant. He also raised concerns about losses in Disneys streaming business and public complaints about low staff wages. Disney may believe that price increases and nickelanddiming of cast members and other costs is good for the bottom line he says. However we suspect it is shortterm thinking that puts the brand value and longterm health of the business at risk. Nickelanddiming is a US term that means to damage someone financially by making a large number of small charges or cuts to pay. Disney was approached for comment. The company recently said it would roll back some of the price increases at its theme parks where spending per person has shot up nearly 40 since 2019 according to Trian Partners which has built up a 0. 5 stake in Disney worth 900m. The increases have come at a time of widespread price inflation across the economy. Staff at Disney parks have also repeatedly protested for higher pay in recent years. Mr Peltz is an activist investor known for battles with big companies such as fast food chain Wendys and Procter Gamble maker of brands such as Pampers and Vicks. In the presentation he says Disney is in crisis and that many of the challenges it faces are selfinflicted. He says the firm overpaid to buy the bulk of Rupert Murdochs Fox empire and granted overthetop compensation packages to chief executive Bob Iger who was recently reinstalled as chief executive. He also raises concerns about the strategy for Disneys streaming business which has reported big losses. Trian Partners is seeking shareholder support for a seat on the board of the company after Disney rejected the request. The firm says it is not seeking to oust Mr Iger who is widely popular. Disney has previously said it is focusing on the bottom line in its streaming business after an initial growth period. It expects the business to turn profitable in its 2024 financial year. The company which has seen its share price sink sharply over the last year has also come under attack from another activist investor Third Point Capital which has pushed the company to spin off its cable sports channel ESPN.,"

But what if the technology is doing more harm than good As increasing numbers of companies rely on artificial intelligence to power their tech we see more cases of dangerous AI dysfunction like autopilot car crashes or content moderation bots promoting harmful social media posts. These conflicts will start to play out in the legal system in 2023 helping define the role of AI in our society going forward. What were waiting for Programmers filed a class action lawsuit against Microsoft and several of its subsidiaries in December for utilizing AIgenerated software that borrowed from existing code on the internet without crediting the creator. According to the lawsuit Microsoft subsidiary Copilot which owns the AIgenerated software ignores violates and removes the Licenses offered by thousandspossibly millionsof software developers thereby accomplishing software piracy on an unprecedented scale. A trial date has not yet been set but the case is likely to be a landmark one and help determine the limits of AI learning. An AI is acting as a legal assistant in an upcoming court case for a speeding ticket. The robot will speak to the defendant through an earpiece to direct them on what to say throughout the case. The AI bot was developed by San Franciscobased startup DoNotPay which says if the AI process doesnt work it will cover all potential fines. The company has not revealed the location of the case or the name of the defendant for privacy reasons. Unconventional wisdom Langdon Winner the author of the book Autonomous Technology describes the chain of reciprocal dependency the fact that despite any autonomy disparities between humans and technology our reliance on it will continue to grow despite experiences detailing the harmful and often irreversible consequences. Winner says that the implementation of this technology has repeatedly confounded our vision our expectations and our capacity to make intelligent judgments meaning our choices and arguments have changed and that the patterns of perceptive thinking that were entirely reliable in the past now lead us systematically astray.

12,South Korea's Yoon warns of ending military pact if North violates ... - Reuters,"South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol said on Wednesday he would consider suspending a 2018 inter-Korean military pact if North Korea violates its airspace again, Yonhap news agency reported, citing his press secretary.",https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-yoon-warns-ending-military-pact-if-north-violates-airspace-again-2023-01-04/,South Koreas Yoon warns of ending military pact after North drone intrusion SEOUL Jan 4 Reuters South Korean President Yoon Sukyeol said on Wednesday he would consider suspending a 2018 interKorean military pact if the North violates its airspace again his office said amid tension over a recent intrusion by North Korean drones. Yoon made the comment after being briefed on countermeasures to North Korean drones that crossed into the South last week calling for building an overwhelming response capability that goes beyond proportional levels according to his press secretary Kim Eunhye. During the meeting he instructed the national security office to consider suspending the validity of the military agreement if North Korea stages another provocation invading our territory Kim told a briefing. The 2018 deal sealed on the sidelines of a summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jaein calls for ceasing all hostile acts creating a nofly zone around the border and removing landmines and guard posts within the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone. The government has not said how many mines and posts were removed citing security concerns. Abandoning the pact could mean the return of the guard posts livefire drills in the former nofly zone and propaganda broadcasts across the border all of which drew angry responses from Pyongyang before the pact. InterKorean relations have been testy for decades but have grown even more tense since Yoon took office in May pledging a tougher line against Pyongyang. During the election campaign last year Yoon said Pyongyang had repeatedly breached the agreement with missile launches and warned he might scrap it. He said after taking office that the pacts fate hinges on the Norths actions. Yoon has criticised the militarys handling of the drone incident in part blaming the previous administrations reliance on the 2018 pact. He has urged the military to stand ready to retaliate even if that means risking escalation. Yoon ordered the defence minister to launch a comprehensive drone unit that performs multipurpose missions including surveillance reconnaissance and electronic warfare and to set up a system to massproduce small drones that are difficult to detect within the year Kim said. He also called for accelerating the development of stealthy drones this year and quickly establishing a drone killer system she said. South Koreas army operated two drone squadrons within its Ground Operations Command since 2018 but they were primarily designed to prepare for future warfare. The defence ministry has said it plans to launch another unit focusing on surveillance and reconnaissance functions especially targeting smaller drones. The upcoming unit would carry entirely different tasks conducting operations in various areas Defence Minister Lee Jongsup told parliament last week. To boost its antidrone capability the ministry announced plans last week it would spend 560 billion won 440 million over the next five years on technology such as airborne laser weapons and signal jammers. 1 1273. 9000 won Our Standards The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.,The Year Ahead in Autonomous Responsibility,Extremely Positive,300,"breaking, numb, harm, dangerous, crashes, harmful, conflicts, limits, harmful, irreversible, confounded, astray, weaker, disastrous, harmful, bad",-,"Nikki, Main, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit, Langdon, Winner, Winner, Langdon, Winner, Madeleine, Clark, Elish, PJ, Rey, lawsuit"

The ministry said nearly two years ago it was moving to the next stage of talks on a comprehensive mutual recognition agreement in financial services such as banking insurance and asset management. UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt met with Ueli Maurer head of Switzerlands Federal Department of Finance on Thursday the ministry tweeted. They discussed the UK Switzerlands close relationship our plans to deepen cooperation on financial services by concluding a Mutual Recognition Agreement by late summer 2023 the ministry said. A report last month from the City of London Corporation TheCityUK and the Professional and Business Services Council urged a speedy mutual recognition deal saying it would represent a new paradigm in international services trade to cut compliance costs and boost growth. It would be based on mutual trust in each others financial rules rather than any rulebyrule alignment. A new financial services and markets bill being approved in parliament gives the ministry powers to implement mutual recognition agreements. It would contrast with the near total cut off in UK financial services from the European Union since Britain left the EU. The EU had rejected UK calls for a mutual recognition deal in financial services and has instead taken steps to build up its own capital market to cut remaining reliance on Britain in areas like derivatives clearing.

The poll of members of the GermanAfrican Business Association also showed that a further 39 of Associations members aim to keep their spending levels in Africa stable. The majority of companies want to expand their activities in the coming year Association head Christoph Kannegiesser told Reuters. It makes sense because the continent is still on a growth trajectory. German companies invested about 1. 6 billion euros in Africa in 2021 of which about 1. 1 billion euros went to the subSahara region according to economy ministry data. As Europes biggest economy has been seeking to reduce its reliance on Russia for gas since the invasion of Ukraine Kannegiesser said he sees big opportunities in the energy sector in Africa. The field of green hydrogen and liquefied gas will give a new impetus in many countries he said highlighting Senegal Nigeria and Mauritania as countries with investment potential. Namibia could also profit massively from green hydrogen production said Kannegiesser. The survey showed that 56 of the companies viewed their business activities in Africa in 2022 positively and a further 7 rated them very good. The Association which says it represents around 85 of German businesses active in Africa wants the government to give greater support through improved conditions for export credit insurance and investment guarantees from the German government to ensure African business is not left to the United States and China. The Association has criticised a law taking effect on Jan. 1 which obliges big companies to act against human rights and climate violations saying it is counterproductive as it creates a new layer of bureaucracy.

Equinor EQNR. OL and RWE RWEG. DE said on Thursday they planned to develop an industrial value chain for the production and use of lowcarbon hydrogen allowing Germany to reduce its reliance on coal power and thus cut its CO2 emissions. Hydrogen is one of the most abundant elements in the universe but traditional methods of producing it at scale release large amounts of carbon dioxide. There are ways to produce the gas that are more climate friendly and hydrogen has been colourcoded to reflect its carbon footprint. Hydrogen extracted using power from renewable energy such as wind or solar is green. Here are details about green grey blue and turquoise hydrogen Green hydrogen Produced using renewable energy which could include offshore wind and solar to power electrolysis plants which split water into hydrogen. Green hydrogen can be stored piped or carried by tankers to consumers for example to serve hydrogen filling stations. Grey hydrogen Grey hydrogen is extracted from coal or natural gas using steammethane reforming which is currently the standard industry process. Blue hydrogen Blue hydrogen is produced in the same way as grey hydrogen but with CO2 emissions captured and then injected into underground or subsea storage such as depleted oil and gas fields. It is often presented as a transitional approach until green hydrogen output can be scaled up. Turquoise hydrogen Also called lowcarbon hydrogen and so far very small scale this is hydrogen generated from natural gas but using pyrolysis the gas is passed through molten metal producing solid carbon as a byproduct with useful applications.

Overall generation from renewables has more than quadrupled over the last decade. Wind solar biomass and hydro are the main sources of renewable power. Fossil fuel still has a larger share providing 42 of Britains power in 2022 which was its biggest contribution to the countrys fuel mix since 2016. Iain Staffell of Imperial College London and lead author of the report said 2022 had been a year like no other for the energy industry. Although renewables provide more cheap green energy than ever before he said the public is feeling the pain of gas prices which surged in response to supply disruption linked to Russias invasion of Ukraine in February. Britain in common with other European countries extended the life of coalfired power units to try to ensure adequate supplies during winter peak demand as Britains power imports dropped to zero in 2022 compared with 8 of supplies in 2021 Drax said. The country has significantly reduced its reliance on coal the most carbonintensive form of power generation. The National Grid said 0. 7 of generation came from coal in November compared with 11. 3 at the same time in 2017. On one day in May renewables provided almost 73 of power to the grid the report said. The rise of renewable power cut Britains carbon emissions by 2. 7 million tonnes compared to the previous year according to Thursdays report. Another report by Drax once heavily reliant on coal and now Britains biggest renewable power generator by output said that between 201019 Britain cut its carbon emissions from its power grid further and faster than any other major economy.

The DUH objects to the discharge of large quantities of environmentally harmful chlorine used for cleaning on the Hoegh Esperanza FSRU operated by Uniper UN01. DE. The economy ministry has taken note of the challenge a spokesperson said on Wednesday at a regular news conference in Berlin adding that any decision was a matter for the relevant local authorities. The FSRU chartered by the German government was put into operation in the North Sea port in December and can hold around 165000 cubic metres of LNG. It is one of several which Germany plans to use to replace Russian gas supply in the wake of Moscows invasion of Ukraine last February. The complaint which comes as police started clearing protesters opposed to the expansion of an opencast lignite mine underscores growing tensions over Berlins climate policy. Environmentalists say climate goals are being neglected during an energy crisis caused by Russias invasion of Ukraine forcing a return to dirtier fuels. There must be no environmental discounts when approving plants for liquefied natural gas the DUHs MuellerKraenner said adding that numerous permanent licences for fossil fuel projects would jeopardise Germanys climate goals.

21,Bulgaria in talks with Turkey on long-term gas deal - Reuters,Bulgaria's interim energy minister is in Istanbul on Friday for talks he hopes will lead to a deal this month on long-term access to liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in neighbouring Turkey and the transit of the gas to its border.,https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/bulgaria-talks-with-turkey-long-term-gas-deal-2022-12-23/,Bulgaria in talks with Turkey on longterm gas deal SOFIA Dec 23 Reuters Bulgarias interim energy minister is in Istanbul on Friday for talks he hopes will lead to a deal this month on longterm access to liquefied natural gas LNG terminals in neighbouring Turkey and the transit of the gas to its border. The chief executives of Bulgarias state gas company Bulgargaz and gas network operator Bulgartransgaz are also taking part in the talks as Bulgaria seeks new sources of gas. Russia which covered over 95 of the Balkan countrys gas needs cut off deliveries to Bulgaria in April after Sofia refused to pay for them in roubles. An energy ministry spokesman said interim minister Rossen Hristov and the chief executives flew to Istanbul late on Thursday. Hristov told reporters before leaving that talks between Bulgarias Bulgargaz and Turkeys Botas were advancing fast and he hoped a deal could be reached this year. We are holding talks to reserve capacity of one billion cubic metres bcm of gas per year on Turkish LNG terminals and for the transit of the gas through Botas network to our border Hristov said. This is very important because we have enough offers for LNG cargo shipments. What we do not have is somewhere to offload them he said. We are firmly committed to cutting our dependence on Russia he added. Bulgaria wants to book capacity at Turkish terminals through 2036 to import 1 bcm of LNG gas a year. The capacity for 2023 will be smaller as Bulgargaz has already booked slots for several months at a Greek LNG terminal. A capacity and transit deal with Botas would allow Bulgargaz to seal its own gas import contracts with U. S. or European LNG producers and cut reliance on Russian gas Hristov said. To try to obtain better prices he said Bulgargaz may also join Botas already advanced talks with major U. S. and European LNG producers. At present the European Union country imports 1 bcm of gas a year from Azerbaijan and covers the rest of its needs about 3 bcm per year through LNG imports from neighbouring Greece. Under the energy ministry plans Bulgaria will cover a third of its gas needs with LNG gas imports through Turkey one third through the LNG terminal near the Greek city of Alexandroupolis which should become operational in 2024 and one third with Azeri supplies.

N signed a memorandum of understanding on Sunday that ensures farmers have the right to repair their own farm equipment or go to an independent technician. As the agriculture sector accelerates its adoption of technology the reliance on hightech machinery such as GPSguided combines and tractors has become more commonplace. But equipment makers such as Deere have generally required customers to use their parts and service divisions for repairs and until recently only allowed authorized dealers the means and tools to access the complex computerized systems of their tractors and other machinery. The Farm Bureaus memorandum of understanding with Deere will ensure farmers everywhere are able to repair our own equipment Farm Bureau president Zippy Duvall said speaking at the federations convention in Puerto Rico. This will enable you and your independent mechanics to identify and fix problems he said. You will have access to the diagnostic tools and information you need. And youll get it at a fair and reasonable price. Dave Gilmore Deeres vice president of ag and turf marketing said the company looks forward to working with the farm group and our customers in the months and years ahead to ensure farmers continue to have the tools and resources to diagnose maintain and repair their equipment. The MOU aims to find a solution to the right to repair debate in the private sector rather than through legislation or regulation according to the document. It benefits farmers and independent repair facilities in the United States and Puerto Rico for the lawful operation and upkeep of Agricultural Equipment the MOU states. The MOU states that among other things equipment owners and independent technicians cannot compromise any safety measures and protocols on the equipment that Deeres intellectual property including its software are protected from infringement and no federal and state emissions control requirements can be compromised because of modifications made to the machinery. The righttorepair movement has gained steam as input costs have surged in recent years as has the price of repairs. For Deere and rival equipment manufacturers such as CNH Industrial and AGCO Corp repairing machinery has given them a solid boost for their parts and services business. Consumers have filed a slew of lawsuits against Deere over the issue and the Biden administration has been pushing for more competition in the rural economy amid rising inflation. Duvall said Farm Bureau officials will meet regularly with Deere to discuss solutions to the challenges farmers are facing in repairing their equipment and said he hoped other farm equipment makers would take similar steps.

LS the worlds fourthlargest renewable power producer has brought onstream the first hybrid windsolar farm in Iberia adding 36. 5 gigawatts GW of annual capacity just as Europe is facing an energy crisis. The Mina de Orgueirel plant about 300 km 186 miles northeast of Portugals capital Lisbon combines 17000 new photovoltaic panels covering an area of roughly six soccer pitches with wind turbines that EDPR already had on the same plot. Like most European countries Portugal is accelerating its shift to renewables to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels whose prices have surged since Russias invasion of Ukraine. Benefiting from abundant sunshine and strong Atlantic winds Portugal seeks to have 80 of its electricity usage coming from renewable sources by 2026 up from 60 now which is already one of the highest ratios in Europe. Duarte Bello chief operating officer at EDPREurope and Latam told Reuters on Thursday the solar panels about doubled the farms capacity to 21 megawatts and its annual generation of 36. 5 GW would be enough to supply more than 30000 people. ITS THE FUTURE He said EDPRs first hybrid plant has been in full production for a few weeks the culmination of five years of work. It is a great signal and great support to accelerating the energy transition using existing assets and increasing the energy independence for the region Portugal and Spain he said. Most of the players understand this is the way going forward. He expected more renewable and storage technologies to be added to such projects in the future. Combined operations reduce production costs as they use no or little additional land and power networks thanks to existing connections to the grid. He expected Europes accelerating push for renewable energies to help streamline the licensing of hybrid projects and shorten their implementation times from up to six years now. We havent seen the impact yet he said expecting it to materialise this year and next. EDPRs mediumsized hybrid farm will serve as a case study for implementing similar projects in all 29 countries where it and its mother company EDP has operations including Poland Italy Brazil and the United States. It is already building four other parks in Iberia and plans to bring online 1. 6 GW of hybrid capacity there this decade.

Kremlincontrolled gas giant Gazprom GAZP. MM has said that Russian daily gas deliveries via the Sudzha entry point through Ukraine to Europe have been at 35. 5 million cubic metres mcm for the past five days down from more than 40 mcm in the past few months. Gazprom did not reply to a request for comment about why volumes have declined. The source speaking on condition of anonymity said the lower volumes probably reflected recordhigh winter temperatures seen across much of Europe over the new year period. Hundreds of sites have seen temperature records smashed in the past days from Switzerland to Poland to Hungary which registered its warmest Christmas Eve in Budapest and saw temperatures climb to 18. 9 degrees Celsius 66 degrees Fahrenheit on Jan. 1. British and Dutch prompt wholesale gas prices mostly edged lower on Tuesday morning as continued milder weather curbed gas demand for heating and as liquefied natural gas LNG supply rose. Europes gas prices are slumping as the combination of mild weather and reduced industrial consumption has produced an unusual seasonal increase in inventories which threatens to overwhelm the storage system. NWE North West Europe is generally well supplied now with storages across Europe at more than healthy levels so makes sense to slow down the take from Russia Refinitiv gas analyst Marina Tsygankova said. Our assumption is that importers from January started to take less under remaining Russian long term contracts as after the recent collapse of European spot prices Russian contracts are not in the money in January. CONFLICT Russian commodity exports have become increasingly politicised amid what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine now in its 11th month. Russias gas exports to Europe via pipelines plummeted to a postSoviet low in 2022 as its largest customer cut imports due to the conflict in Ukraine and a major pipeline was damaged by mysterious blasts. The European Union has spoken for years about cutting its heavy reliance on Russian energy but it only started to get serious after the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February. Gas storage operators in Germany which used to be Gazproms largest consumer of gas expressed optimism on Tuesday there would be no supply problems next winter due to declining consumption and said there was no chance of shortages this winter. Milder temperatures for the time of year across much of Europe have meant gas stock levels have remained stable rather than being drawn down as would normally be the case during winter. Overall Europes gas stores were 83 full on Jan. 8 according to the latest data from Gas Infrastructure Europe little changed from the end of last year. Separately Gazprom Mezhregiongaz a branch of Gazprom responsible for domestic gas supplies said on Tuesday that on Jan. 8 it saw a daily recordhigh of gas deliveries to Russian consumers for the past three years or 1. 74 billion cubic metres due to low temperatures across many regions.

The Kovykta gas field will feed into the Power of Siberia pipeline carrying Russian gas to China. With recoverable reserves of 1. 8 trillion cubic metres it is the largest in eastern Russia. The launch is part of Russias strategy to shift gas exports to the east as the European Union cuts reliance on Russian energy in response to the war in Ukraine. Putin hailed it as a significant event for Russias energy industry and the whole economy. He joined a video link to workers at the site who were shown lined up on the snow in blue protective suits and white helmets and gave the order Start work to inaugurate the project. Russia started selling natural gas to China at the end of 2019 via the Power of Siberia pipeline which supplied about 10 billion cubic metres bcm of gas in 2021 and is due to reach its full capacity of 38 bcm in 2025. Russia is now Beijings No. 3 gas supplier. In February Putin reached an agreement to sell an additional 10 bcm of gas to China from Russias Far East through a new smaller pipeline to Chinas northeast. Russia also plans to construct another major pipeline the Power of Siberia 2 via Mongolia with a view to selling an additional 50 bcm of gas per year. Putin said last week the projects would allow Russia to boost its gas sales to China to 48 bcm annually by 2025 and to 88 bcm by 2030.

The European Union traditionally Russias largest consumer for oil and gas has for years spoken about cutting its reliance on Russian energy but Brussels got serious after the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February. Statecontrolled Gazprom citing Chief Executive Officer Alexei Miller a longstanding ally of President Vladimir Putin said its exports outside of exSoviet Union will reach 100. 9 billion cubic metres bcm this year. That is a fall of more than 45 from 185. 1 bcm in 2021 and includes supplies to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline through which Gazprom supplied 10. 39 bcm last year. Russian direct gas exports to Germany Europes largest economy were halted in September following blasts at the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea. Sweden and Denmark have both concluded that four leaks on Nord Stream 1 and 2 were caused by explosions but have not said who might be responsible. NATO SecretaryGeneral Jens Stoltenberg has called the damage an act of sabotage. Russia accused British navy personnel of being behind the blasts a claim that London said was false. Russian gas exports via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline totalled recordhigh 59. 2 bcm last year. The 100. 9 bcm of Russian gas pipeline supplies which Gazprom defines as exports to far abroad or outside the formerSoviet Union is one of the lowest since the collapse of the Soviet state in 1991. One of Gazproms previous postSoviet lows of gas sales to far abroad was at 117. 4 bcm in 1995 according to Gazprom Export. Russia meanwhile has been increasing its seaborne liquefied natural gas LNG sales thanks mostly to Novatek NVTK. MMled Yamal LNG plant in the Arctic. According to the Rosstat government body Russias LNG production rose by almost 10 in January November to 29. 7 million tonnes.

According to Bloomberg Apple is aiming to start using its own screens for the iPhone and Apple Watch. The transition is expected to begin with the version of the Apple Watch Ultra released in 2024 the report says. Currently Apple relies on partners such as Samsung and LG for displays that it uses in the iPhone iPad and Apple Watch. The companys move to start using its own custom displays in mobile devices represents a major blow to these partners as Bloomberg explains Apple Inc. is planning to start using its own custom displays in mobile devices as early as 2024 an effort to reduce its reliance on technology partners like Samsung and LG and bring more components inhouse Bloomberg News reports. In addition to Samsung and LG Apple also sources displays from companies like Japan Display BOE Technology and Sharp. As of right now Apples focus seems to be on its mobile devices. The switchover will start with the highestend Apple Watches toward the end of 2024 the report explains. As part of this the Apple Watch will also switch from OLED displays to microLED displays. Apple plans to eventually bring the displays to other devices including the iPhone. Compared with current Apple Watches the nextgeneration displays are designed to offer brighter more vibrant colors and the ability to be better seen at an angle. The displays make content appear like its painted on top of the glass according to people who have seen them who asked not to be identified because the project is still under wraps. The effort is being spearheaded inside Apple by Wei Chen the head of Apples display technology group. This group operates within John Sroujis Hardware Technologies division. According to Bloomberg Apple ramped up its efforts to switch to microLED in 2018 with a goal of releasing its first product by early 2020. The project however languished due to high costs and technical challenges. Because of this its possible that the 2024 target outlined today could slip until 2025. Apple will still rely on an outside supplier to handle mass production of these displays but it has designed the new displays and devised their manufacturing process entirely inhouse. The move comes as Apple is also planning to drop other partners such as Qualcomm and Broadcom for cellular modems Bluetooth chips and WiFi chips. The company also of course moved from Intel processors to its own Apple Silicon processors for the Mac starting in 2020.

29,Papers and patents are becoming less disruptive over time,"A decline in disruptive science and technology over time is reported, representing a substantive shift in science and technology, which is attributed in part to the reliance on a narrower set of existing knowledge.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x,Abstract Theories of scientific and technological change view discovery and invention as endogenous processes 12 wherein previous accumulated knowledge enables future progress by allowing researchers to in Newtons words stand on the shoulders of giants 34567. Recent decades have witnessed exponential growth in the volume of new scientific and technological knowledge thereby creating conditions that should be ripe for major advances 89. Yet contrary to this view studies suggest that progress is slowing in several major fields 1011. Here we analyse these claims at scale across six decades using data on 45 million papers and 3. 9 million patents from six largescale datasets together with a new quantitative metricthe CD index 12that characterizes how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology. We find that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions. This pattern holds universally across fields and is robust across multiple different citation and textbased metrics 11314151617. Subsequently we link this decline in disruptiveness to a narrowing in the use of previous knowledge allowing us to reconcile the patterns we observe with the shoulders of giants view. We find that the observed declines are unlikely to be driven by changes in the quality of published science citation practices or fieldspecific factors. Overall our results suggest that slowing rates of disruption may reflect a fundamental shift in the nature of science and technology. Main Although the past century witnessed an unprecedented expansion of scientific and technological knowledge there are concerns that innovative activity is slowing 181920. Studies document declining research productivity in semiconductors pharmaceuticals and other fields 1011. Papers patents and even grant applications have become less novel relative to prior work and less likely to connect disparate areas of knowledge both of which are precursors of innovation 2122. The gap between the year of discovery and the awarding of a Nobel Prize has also increased 2324 suggesting that todays contributions do not measure up to the past. These trends have attracted increasing attention from policymakers as they pose substantial threats to economic growth human health and wellbeing and national security along with global efforts to combat grand challenges such as climate change 2526. Numerous explanations for this slowdown have been proposed. Some point to a dearth of lowhanging fruit as the readily available productivityenhancing innovations have already been made 1927. Others emphasize the increasing burden of knowledge scientists and inventors require ever more training to reach the frontiers of their fields leaving less time to push those frontiers forward 1828. Yet much remains unknown not merely about the causes of slowing innovative activity but also the depth and breadth of the phenomenon. The decline is difficult to reconcile with centuries of observation by philosophers of science who characterize the growth of knowledge as an endogenous process wherein previous knowledge enables future discovery a view captured famously in Newtons observation that if he had seen further it was by standing on the shoulders of giants 3. Moreover to date the evidence pointing to a slowdown is based on studies of particular fields using disparate and domainspecific metrics 1011 making it difficult to know whether the changes are happening at similar rates across areas of science and technology. Little is also known about whether the patterns seen in aggregate indicators mask differences in the degree to which individual works push the frontier. We address these gaps in understanding by analysing 25 million papers 19452010 in the Web of Science WoS Methods and 3. 9 million patents 19762010 in the United States Patent and Trademark Offices USPTO Patents View database Methods. The WoS data include 390 million citations 25 million paper titles and 13 million abstracts. The Patents View data include 35 million citations 3. 9 million patent titles and 3. 9 million abstracts. Subsequently we replicate our core findings on four additional datasetsJSTOR the American Physical Society corpus Microsoft Academic Graph and PubMedencompassing 20 million papers. Using these data we join a new citationbased measure 12 with textual analyses of titles and abstracts to understand whether papers and patents forge new directions over time and across fields. Measurement of disruptiveness To characterize the nature of innovation we draw on foundational theories of scientific and technological change 22930 which distinguish between two types of breakthroughs. First some contributions improve existing streams of knowledge and therefore consolidate the status quo. Kohn and Sham 1965 31 a Nobelwinning paper used established theorems to develop a method for calculating the structure of electrons which cemented the value of previous research. Second some contributions disrupt existing knowledge rendering it obsolete and propelling science and technology in new directions. Watson and Crick 1953 32 also a Nobel winner introduced a model of the structure of DNA that superseded previous approaches for example Paulings triple helix. Kohn and Sham and Watson and Crick were both important but their implications for scientific and technological change were different. We quantify this distinction using a measurethe CD index 12that characterizes the consolidating or disruptive nature of science and technology Fig. 1. The intuition is that if a paper or patent is disruptive the subsequent work that cites it is less likely to also cite its predecessors for future researchers the ideas that went into its production are less relevant for example Paulings triple helix. If a paper or patent is consolidating subsequent work that cites it is also more likely to cite its predecessors for future researchers the knowledge upon which the work builds is still and perhaps more relevant for example the theorems Kohn and Sham used. The CD index ranges from 1 consolidating to 1 disruptive. We measure the CD index five years after the year of each papers publication indicated by CD 5 see Extended Data Fig. 1 for the distribution of CD 5 among papers and patents and Extended Data Fig. 2 for analyses using alternative windows 33. For example Watson and Crick and Kohn and Sham both received over a hundred citations within five years of being published. However the Kohn and Sham paper has a CD 5 of 0. 22 indicating consolidation whereas the Watson and Crick paper has a CD 5 of 0. 62 indicating disruption. The CD index has been validated extensively in previous research including through correlation with expert assessments 1234. Declining disruptiveness Across fields we find that science and technology are becoming less disruptive. Figure 2 plots the average CD 5 over time for papers Fig. 2a and patents Fig. 2b. For papers the decrease between 1945 and 2010 ranges from 91. 9 where the average CD 5 dropped from 0. 52 in 1945 to 0. 04 in 2010 for social sciences to 100 where the average CD 5 decreased from 0. 36 in 1945 to 0 in 2010 for physical sciences for patents the decrease between 1980 and 2010 ranges from 78. 7 where the average CD 5 decreased from 0. 30 in 1980 to 0. 06 in 2010 for computers and communications to 91. 5 where the average CD 5 decreased from 0. 38 in 1980 to 0. 03 in 2010 for drugs and medical. For both papers and patents the rates of decline are greatest in the earlier parts of the time series and for patents they appear to begin stabilizing between the years 2000 and 2005. For papers since about 1980 the rate of decline has been more modest in life sciences and biomedicine and physical sciences and most marked and persistent in social sciences and technology. Overall however relative to earlier eras recent papers and patents do less to push science and technology in new directions. The general similarity in trends we observe across fields is noteworthy in light of lowhanging fruit theories 1927 which would probably predict greater heterogeneity in the decline as it seems unlikely fields would consume their lowhanging fruit at similar rates or times. Linguistic change The decline in disruptive science and technology is also observable using alternative indicators. Because they create departures from the status quo disruptive papers and patents are likely to introduce new words for example words used to create a new paradigm might differ from those that are used to develop an existing paradigm 3536. Therefore if disruptiveness is declining we would expect a decline in the diversity of words used in science and technology. To evaluate this Fig. 3ad documents the typetoken ratio that is uniquetotal words of paper and patent titles over time Supplementary Information section 1. We observe substantial declines especially in the earlier periods before 1970 for papers and 1990 for patents. For paper titles Fig. 3a the decrease 19452010 ranges from 76. 5 social sciences to 88 technology for patent titles Fig. 3d the decrease 19802010 ranges from 32. 5 chemical to 81 computers and communications. For paper abstracts Extended Data Fig. 3a the decrease 19922010 ranges from 23. 1 life sciences and biomedicine to 38. 9 social sciences for patent abstracts Extended Data Fig. 3b the decrease 19802010 ranges from 21. 5 mechanical to 73. 2 computers and communications. In Fig. 3be we demonstrate that these declines in word diversity are accompanied by similar declines in combinatorial novelty over time the particular words that scientists and inventors use in the titles of their papers and patents are increasingly likely to have been used together in the titles of previous work. Consistent with these trends in language we also observe declining novelty in the combinations of previous work cited by papers and patents based on a previously established measure of atypical combinations 14 Extended Data Fig. 4. The decline in disruptive activity is also apparent in the specific words used by scientists and inventors. If disruptiveness is declining we reasoned that verbs alluding to the creation discovery or perception of new things should be used less frequently over time whereas verbs alluding to the improvement application or assessment of existing things may be used more often 3536. Figure 3 shows the most common verbs in paper Fig. 3c and patent titles Fig. 3f in the first and last decade of each sample Supplementary Information section 2. Although precisely and quantitatively characterizing words as consolidating or disruptive is challenging in the absence of context the figure highlights a clear and qualitative shift in language. In the earlier decades verbs evoking creation for example produce form prepare and make discovery for example determine and report and perception for example measure are prevalent in both paper and patent titles. In the later decades however these verbs are almost completely displaced by those tending to be more evocative of the improvement for example improve enhance and increase application for example use and include or assessment for example associate mediate and relate of existing scientific and technological knowledge and artefacts. Taken together these patterns suggest a substantive shift in science and technology over time with discovery and invention becoming less disruptive in nature consistent with our results using the CD index. Conservation of highly disruptive work The aggregate trends we document mask considerable heterogeneity in the disruptiveness of individual papers and patents and remarkable stability in the absolute number of highly disruptive works Methods and Fig. 4. Specifically despite large increases in scientific productivity the number of papers and patents with CD 5 values in the far right tail of the distribution remains nearly constant over time. This conservation of the absolute number of highly disruptive papers and patents holds despite considerable churn in the underlying fields responsible for producing those works Extended Data Fig. 5 inset. These results suggest that the persistence of major breakthroughsfor example measurement of gravity waves and COVID19 vaccinesis not inconsistent with slowing innovative activity. In short declining aggregate disruptiveness does not preclude individual highly disruptive works. Alternative explanations What is driving the decline in disruptiveness Earlier we suggested our results are not consistent with explanations that link slowing innovative activity to diminishing lowhanging fruit. Extended Data Fig. 5 shows that the decline in disruptiveness is unlikely to be due to other fieldspecific factors by decomposing variation in CD 5 attributable to field author and year effects Methods. Declining rates of disruptive activity are unlikely to be caused by the diminishing quality of science and technology 2237. If they were then the patterns seen in Fig. 2 should be less visible in highquality work. However when we restrict our sample to articles published in premier publication venues such as Nature Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Science or to Nobelwinning discoveries 38 Fig. 5 the downward trend persists. Furthermore the trend is not driven by characteristics of the WoS and UPSTO data or our particular derivation of the CD index we observe similar declines in disruptiveness when we compute CD 5 on papers in JSTOR the American Physical Society corpus Microsoft Academic Graph and PubMed Methods the results of which are shown in Extended Data Fig. 6. We further show that the decline is not an artefact of the CD index by reporting similar patterns using alternative derivations 1315 Methods and Extended Data Fig. 7. Declines in disruptiveness are also not attributable to changing publication citation or authorship practices Methods. First using approaches from the bibliometrics literature 3940414243 we computed several normalized versions of the CD index that adjusted for the increasing tendency for papers and patents to cite previous work 4445. Results using these alternative indicators Extended Data Fig. 8ad were similar to those we reported in Fig. 2. Second using regression we estimated models of CD 5 as a function of indicator variables for each paper or patents publication year along with specific controls for field year levelnumber of new paperspatents mean number of paperspatents cited mean number of authors or inventors per paperand paper or patentlevelnumber of papers or patents citedfactors. Predictions from these models indicated a decline in disruptive papers and patents Extended Data Fig. 8be and Supplementary Table 1 that was consistent with our main results. Finally using Monte Carlo simulations we randomly rewired the observed citation networks while preserving key characteristics of scientists and inventors citation behaviour including the number of citations made and received by individual papers and patents and the age gap between citing and cited works. We find that observed CD 5 values are lower than those from the simulated networks Extended Data Fig. 8cf and the gap is widening over time papers and patents are increasingly less disruptive than would be expected by chance. Taken together these additional analyses indicate that the decline in CD 5 is unlikely to be driven by changing publication citation or authorship practices. Growth of knowledge and disruptiveness We also considered how declining disruptiveness relates to the growth of knowledge Extended Data Fig. 9. On the one hand scientists and inventors face an increasing knowledge burden which may inhibit discoveries and inventions that disrupt the status quo. On the other hand as previously noted philosophers of science suggest that existing knowledge fosters discovery and invention 367. Using regression models we evaluated the relationship between the stock of papers and patents a proxy for knowledge within fields and their CD 5 Supplementary Information section 3 and Supplementary Table 2. We find a positive effect of the growth of knowledge on disruptiveness for papers consistent with previous work 20 however we find a negative effect for patents. Given these conflicting results we considered the possibility that the availability of knowledge may differ from its use. In particular the growth in publishing and patenting may lead scientists and inventors to focus on narrower slices of previous work 1846 thereby limiting the effective stock of knowledge. Using three proxies we document a decline in the use of previous knowledge among scientists and inventors Fig. 6. First we see a decline in the diversity of work cited Fig. 6ad indicating that contemporary science and technology are engaging with narrower slices of existing knowledge. Moreover this decline in diversity is accompanied by an increase in the share of citations to the 1 most highly cited papers and patents Fig. 6a idi which are also decreasing in semantic diversity Fig. 6a iid ii. Over time scientists and inventors are increasingly citing the same previous work and that previous work is becoming more topically similar. Second we see an increase in selfcitation Fig. 6be a common proxy for the continuation of ones preexisting research stream 474849 which is consistent with scientists and inventors relying more on highly familiar knowledge. Third the mean age of work cited a common measure for the use of dated knowledge 505152 is increasing Fig. 6cf suggesting that scientists and inventors may be struggling to keep up with the pace of knowledge expansion and instead relying on older familiar work. All three indicators point to a consistent story a narrower scope of existing knowledge is informing contemporary discovery and invention. Results from a subsequent series of regression models suggest that use of less diverse work more of ones own work and older work are all negatively associated with disruption Methods Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3 a pattern that holds even after accounting for the average age and number of previous works produced by team members. When the range of work used by scientists and inventors narrows disruptive activity declines. Discussion In summary we report a marked decline in disruptive science and technology over time. Our analyses show that this trend is unlikely to be driven by changes in citation practices or the quality of published work. Rather the decline represents a substantive shift in science and technology one that reinforces concerns about slowing innovative activity. We attribute this trend in part to scientists and inventors reliance on a narrower set of existing knowledge. Even though philosophers of science may be correct that the growth of knowledge is an endogenous processwherein accumulated understanding promotes future discovery and inventionengagement with a broad range of extant knowledge is necessary for that process to play out a requirement that appears more difficult with time. Relying on narrower slices of knowledge benefits individual careers 53 but not scientific progress more generally. Moreover even though the prevalence of disruptive works has declined we find that the sheer number has remained stable. On the one hand this result may suggest that there is a fixed carrying capacity for highly disruptive science and technology in which case policy interventions aimed at increasing such work may prove challenging. On the other hand our observation of considerable churn in the underlying fields responsible for producing disruptive science and technology suggests the potential importance of factors such as the shifting interests of funders and scientists and the ripeness of scientific and technologicalknowledge for breakthroughs in which case the production of disruptive work may be responsive to policy levers. In either case the stability we observe in the sheer number of disruptive papers and patents suggests that science and technology do not appear to have reached the end of the endless frontier. Room remains for the regular rerouting that disruptive works contribute to scientific and technological progress. Our study is not without limitations. Notably even though research to date supports the validity of the CD index 1234 it is a relatively new indicator of innovative activity and will benefit from future work on its behaviour and properties especially across data sources and contexts. Studies that systematically examine the effect of different citation practices 5455 which vary across fields would be particularly informative. Overall our results deepen understanding of the evolution of knowledge and may guide career planning and science policy. To promote disruptive science and technology scholars may be encouraged to read widely and given time to keep up with the rapidly expanding knowledge frontier. Universities may forgo the focus on quantity and more strongly reward research quality 56 and perhaps more fully subsidize yearlong sabbaticals. Federal agencies may invest in the riskier and longerterm individual awards that support careers and not simply specific projects 57 giving scholars the gift of time needed to step outside the fray inoculate themselves from the publish or perish culture and produce truly consequential work. Understanding the decline in disruptive science and technology more fully permits a muchneeded rethinking of strategies for organizing the production of science and technology in the future. Methods WoS data We limit our focus to research papers published between 1945 and 2010. Although the WoS data begin in the year 1900 the scale and social organization of science shifted markedly in the postwar era thereby making comparisons with the present difficult and potentially misleading 676869. We end our analyses of papers in 2010 because some of our measures require several subsequent years of data following paper publication. The WoS data archive 65 million documents published in 28968 journals between 1900 and 2017 and 735 million citations among them. In addition the WoS data include the titles and the full text of abstracts for 65 and 29 million records respectively published between 1913 and 2017. After eliminating nonresearch documents for example book reviews and commentaries and subsetting the data to the 19452010 window the analytical sample consists of n 24659076 papers. Patents View data We limit our focus to patents granted from 1976 which is the earliest year for which machinereadable records are available in the Patents View data. As we did with papers we end our analyses in 2010 because some measures require data from subsequent years for calculation. The Patents View data are the most exhaustive source of historical data on inventions with information on 6. 5 million patents granted between 1976 and 2017 and their corresponding 92 million citations. The Patents View data include the titles and abstracts for 6. 5 million patents granted between 1976 and 2017. Following previous work 12 we focused our attention on utility patents which cover the vast majority 91 in our data of patented inventions. After eliminating nonutility patents and subsetting the data to the 19762010 window the analytical sample consists of n 3912353 patents. Highly disruptive papers and patents Observations and claims of slowing progress in science and technology are increasingly common supported not only by the evidence we report but also by previous research from diverse methodological and disciplinary perspectives 101118192021222324. Yet as noted in the main text there is a tension between observations of slowing progress from aggregate data on the one hand and continuing reports of seemingly major breakthroughs in many fields of science and technologyspanning everything from the measurement of gravity waves to the sequencing of the human genomeon the other. In an effort to reconcile this tension we considered the possibility that whereas overall discovery and invention may be less disruptive over time the highlevel view taken in previous work may mask considerable heterogeneity. Put differently aggregate evidence of slowing progress does not preclude the possibility that some subset of discoveries and inventions is highly disruptive. To evaluate this possibility we plot the number of disruptive papers Fig. 4a and patents Fig. 4b over time where disruptive papers and patents are defined as those with CD 5 values 0. Within each panel we plot four lines corresponding to four evenly spaced intervals0 0. 25 0. 25 0. 5 0. 5 0. 75 0. 75 1. 00over the positive values of CD 5. The first two intervals therefore correspond to papers and patents that are relatively weakly disruptive whereas the latter two correspond to those that are more strongly so for example where we may expect to see major breakthroughs such as some of those mentioned above. Despite major increases in the numbers of papers and patents published each year we see little change in the number of highly disruptive papers and patents as evidenced by the relatively flat red green and orange lines. Notably this conservation of disruptive work holds even despite fluctuations over time in the composition of the scientific and technological fields responsible for producing the most disruptive work Fig. 4 inset plots. Overall these results help to account for simultaneous observations of both major breakthroughs in many fields of science and technology and aggregate evidence of slowing progress. Relative contribution of field year and author or inventor effects Our results show a steady decline in the disruptiveness of science and technology over time. Moreover the patterns we observe are generally similar across broad fields of study which suggests that the factors driving the decline are not unique to specific domains of science and technology. The decline could be driven by other factors such as the conditions of science and technology at a point in time or the particular individuals who produce science and technology. For example exogenous factors such as economic conditions may encourage research or invention practices that are less disruptive. Similarly scientists and inventors of different generations may have different approaches which may result in greater or lesser tendencies for producing disruptive work. We therefore sought to understand the relative contribution of field year and author or inventor factors to the decline of disruptive science and technology. To do so we decomposed the relative contribution of field year and author fixed effects to the predictive power of regression models of the CD index. The unit of observation in these regressions is the author or inventor year. We enter field fixed effects using granular subfield indicators that is 150 WoS subject areas for papers 138 NBER subcategories for patents. For simplicity we did not include additional covariates beyond the fixed effects in our models. Field fixed effects capture all fieldspecific factors that do not vary by author or year for example the basic subject matter year fixed effects capture all yearspecific factors that do not vary by field or author for example the state of communication technology author or inventor fixed effects capture all authorspecific factors that do not vary by field or year for example the year of PhD awarding. After specifying our model we determine the relative contribution of field year and author fixed effects to the overall model adjusted R 2 using ShapleyOwen decomposition. Specifically given our n 3 groups of fixed effects field year and author we evaluate the relative contribution of each set of fixed effects by estimating the adjusted R 2 separately for the 2 models using subsets of the predictors. The relative contribution of each set of fixed effects is then computed using the Shapley value from game theory n 70. Results of this analysis are shown in Extended Data Fig. 5 for both papers top bar and patents bottom bar. Total bar size corresponds to the value of the adjusted R 2 for the fully specified model that is with all three groups of fixed effects. Consistent with our observations from plots of the CD index over time we observe that for both papers and patents fieldspecific factors make the lowest relative contribution to the adjusted R 2 0. 02 and 0. 01 for papers and patents respectively. Author fixed effects by contrast appear to contribute much more to the predictive power of the model for both papers 0. 20 and patents 0. 17. Researchers and inventors who entered the field in more recent years may face a higher burden of knowledge and thus resort to building on narrower slices of existing work for example because of more specialized doctoral training which would generally lead to less disruptive science and technology being produced in later years consistent with our findings. The pattern is more complex for year fixed effects although yearspecific factors that do not vary by field or author hold more explanatory power than field for both papers 0. 02 and patents 0. 16 they appear to be substantially more important for the latter than the former. Taken together these findings suggest that relatively stable factors that vary across individual scientists and inventors may be particularly important for understanding changes in disruptiveness over time. The results also confirm that domainspecific factors across fields of science and technology play a very small role in explaining the decline in disruptiveness of papers and patents. Alternative samples We also considered whether the patterns we document may be artefacts of our choice of data sources. Although we observe consistent trends in both the WoS and Patents View data and both databases are widely used by the Science of Science community our results may conceivably be driven by factors such as changes in coverage for example journals added or excluded from WoS over time or even data errors rather than fundamental changes in science and technology. To evaluate this possibility we therefore calculated CD 5 for papers in four additional databasesJSTOR the American Physical Society corpus Microsoft Academic Graph and PubMed. We included all records from 1930 to 2010 from PubMed 16774282 papers JSTOR 1703353 papers and American Physical Society 478373 papers. The JSTOR data were obtained via a special request from ITHAKA the data maintainer httpwww. ithaka. org as were the American Physical Society data httpsjournals. aps. orgdatasets. We downloaded the Microsoft Academic Graph data from CADRE at Indiana University httpscadre. iu. edu. The PubMed data were downloaded from the National Library of Medicine FTP server ftpftp. ncbi. nlm. nih. govpubmedbaseline. Owing to the exceptionally large scale of Microsoft Academic Graph and the associated computational burden we randomly extracted 1 million papers. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 6 the downward trend in disruptiveness is evident across all samples. Alternative bibliometric measures Several recent papers have introduced alternative specifications of the CD index 12. We evaluated whether the declines in disruptiveness we observe are corroborated using two alternative variations. One criticism of the CD index has been that the number of papers that cite only the focal papers references dominates the measure 13. Bornmann et al. 13 proposes rmDIlrmnok as a variant that is less susceptible to this issue. Another potential weakness of the CD index is that it could be very sensitive to small changes in the forward citation patterns of papers that make no backward citations 15. Leydesdorff et al. 15 suggests DI as an alternate indicator of disruption that addresses this issue. Therefore we calculated rmDIlrmnok where l 5 and DI for 100000 randomly drawn papers and patents each from our analytic sample. Results are presented in Extended Data Fig. 7a papers and b patents. The blue lines indicate disruption based on Bornmann et al. 13 and the orange lines indicate disruption based on Leydesdorff et al. 15. Across science and technology the two alternative measures both show declines in disruption over time similar to the patterns observed with the CD index. Taken together these results suggest that the declines in disruption we document are not an artefact of our particular operationalization. Robustness to changes in publication citation and authorship practices We also considered whether our results may be attributable to changes in publication citation or authorship practices rather than by substantive shifts in discovery and invention. Perhaps most critically as noted in the main text there has been a marked expansion in publishing and patenting over the period of our study. This expansion has naturally increased the amount of previous work that is relevant to current science and technology and therefore at risk of being cited a pattern reflected in the marked increase in the average number of citations made by papers and patents that is papers and patents are citing more previous work than in previous eras 4445. Recall that the CD index quantifies the degree to which future work cites a focal work together with its predecessors that is the references in the bibliography of the focal work. Greater citation of a focal work independently of its predecessors is taken to be evidence of a social process of disruption. As papers and patents cite more previous work however the probability of a focal work being cited independently of its predecessors may decline mechanically the more citations a focal work makes the more likely future work is to cite it together with one of its predecessors even by chance. Consequently increases in the number of papers and patents available for citing and in the average number of citations made by scientists and inventors may contribute to the declining values of the CD index. In short given the marked changes in science and technology over our long study window the CD index of papers and patents published in earlier periods may not be directly comparable to those of more recent vintage which could in turn render our conclusions about the decline in disruptive science and technology suspect. We addressed these concerns using three distinctive but complementary approachesnormalization regression adjustment and simulation. Verification using normalization First following common practice in bibliometric research 3940414243 we developed two normalized versions of the CD index with the goal of facilitating comparisons across time. Among the various components of the CD index we focused our attention on the count of papers or patents that only cite the focal works references N k as this term would seem most likely to scale with the increases in publishing and patenting and in the average number of citations made by papers and patents to previous work 13. Larger values of N k lead to smaller values of the CD index. Consequently marked increases in N k over time particularly relative to other components of the measure may lead to a downward bias thereby inhibiting our ability to accurately compare disruptive science and technology in later years with earlier periods. Our two normalized versions of the CD index aim to address this potential bias by attenuating the effect of increases in N k. In the first version which we call Paper normalized we subtract from N k the number of citations made by the focal paper or patent to previous work N b. The intuition behind this adjustment is that when a focal paper or patent cites more previous work N k is likely to be larger because there are more opportunities for future work to cite the focal paper or patents predecessors. This increase in N k would result in lower values of the CD index although not necessarily as a result of the focal paper or patent being less disruptive. In the second version which we call field year normalized we subtract N k by the average number of backward citations made by papers or patents in the focal paper or patents WoS research area or NBER technology category respectively during its year of publication we label this quantity Nrmbrmmrmermarmn. The intuition behind this adjustment is that in fields and time periods in which there is a greater tendency for scientists and inventors to cite previous work N k is also likely to be larger thereby leading to lower values of the CD index although again not necessarily as a result of the focal paper or patent being less disruptive. In cases in which either N b or Nrmbrmmrmermarmn exceed the value of N k we set N k to 0 that is N k is never negative in the normalized measures. Both adaptations of the CD index are inspired by established approaches in the scientometrics literature and may be understood as a form of citing side normalization that is normalization by correcting for the effect of differences in lengths of references lists 40. In Extended Data Fig. 8 we plot the average values of both normalized versions of the CD index over time separately for papers Extended Data Fig. 8a and patents Extended Data Fig. 8d. Consistent with our findings reported in the main text we continue to observe a decline in the CD index over time suggesting that the patterns we observe in disruptive science and technology are unlikely to be driven by changes in citation practices. Verification using regression adjustment Second we adjusted for potential confounding using a regressionbased approach. This approach complements the bibliometric normalizations just described by allowing us to account for a broader array of changes in publication citation and authorship practices in general the latter of which is not directly accounted for in either the normalization approach or the simulation approach described next and increases the amount of previous work that is relevant to current science and technology in particular. In Supplementary Table 1 we report the results of regression models predicting CD 5 for papers Models 14 and patents Models 58 with indicator variables included for each year of our study window the reference categories are 1945 and 1980 for papers and patents respectively. Models 1 and 4 are the baseline models and include no other adjustments beyond the year indicators. In Models 2 and 5 we add subfield fixed effects WoS subject areas for papers and NBER technology subcategories for patents. Finally in Models 34 and 78 we add control variables for several field year levelnumber of new papers orpatents mean number of papers or patents cited mean number of authors or inventors per paperand paper or patentlevelnumber of papers or patents citedcharacteristics thereby enabling more robust comparisons in patterns of disruptive science and technology over the long time period spanned by our study. For the paper models we also include a paperlevel control for the number of unlinked references that is the number of citations to works that are not indexed in WoS. We find that the inclusion of these controls improves model fit as indicated by statistically significant Wald tests presented below the relevant models. Across all eight models shown in Supplementary Table 1 we find that the coefficients on the year indicators are statistically significant and negative and growing in magnitude over time which is consistent with the patterns we reported based on unadjusted CD 5 values index in the main text Fig. 2. In Extended Data Fig. 8 we visualize the results of our regressionbased approach by plotting the predicted CD 5 values separately for each of the year indicators included in Models 4 papers and 8 patents. To enable comparisons with raw CD 5 values shown in the main text we present the separate predictions made for each year as a line graph. As shown in the figure we continue to observe declining values of the CD index across papers and patents even when accounting for changes in publication citation and authorship practices. Verification using simulation Third following related work in the Science of Science 14717273 we considered whether our results may be an artefact of changing patterns in publishing and citation practices by using a simulation approach. In essence the CD index measures disruption by characterizing the network of citations around a focal paper or patent. However many complex networks even those resulting from random processes exhibit structures that yield nontrivial values on common network measures for example clustering 747576. During the period spanned by our study the citation networks of science and technology experienced significant change with marked increases in both the numbers of nodes that is papers or patents and edges that is citations. Thus rather than reflecting a meaningful social process the observed declines in disruption may result from these structural changes in the underlying citation networks. To evaluate this possibility we followed standard techniques from network science 7577 and conducted an analysis in which we recomputed the CD index on randomly rewired citation networks. If the patterns we observe in the CD index are the result of structural changes in the citation networks of science and technology for example growth in the number of nodes or edges rather than a meaningful social process then these patterns should also be visible in comparable random networks that experience similar structural changes. Therefore finding that the patterns we see in the CD index differ for the observed and random citation networks would serve as evidence that the decline in disruption is not an artefact of the data. We began by creating copies of the underlying citation network on which the values of the CD index used in all analyses reported in the main text were based separately for papers and patents. For each citation network one for papers one for patents we then rewired citations using a degreepreserving randomization algorithm. In each iteration of the algorithm two edges for example AB and CD are selected from the underlying citation network after which the algorithm attempts to swap the two endpoints of the edges for example AB becomes AD and CD becomes CB. If the degree centrality of A B C and D remains the same after the swap the swap is retained otherwise the algorithm discards the swap and moves on to the next iteration. When evaluating degree centrality we consider indegree that is citations from other papers or patents to the focal paper or patent and outdegree that is citations from the focal paper or patent to other papers or patents separately. Furthermore we also required that the age distribution of citing and cited papers or patents was identical in the original and rewired networks. Specifically swaps were only retained when the publication year of the original and candidate citations was the same. In light of these design choices our rewiring algorithm should be seen as fairly conservative as it preserves substantial structure from the original network. There is no scholarly consensus on the number of swaps necessary to ensure the original and rewired networks are sufficiently different from one another the rule we adopt here is 100 m where m is the number of edges in the network being rewired. Following previous work 14 we created ten rewired copies of the observed citation networks for both papers and patents. After creating these rewired citation networks we then recomputed CD 5. Owing to the large scale of the WoS data we base our analyses on a random subsample of ten million papers CD 5 was computed on the rewired network for all patents. For each paper and patent we then compute a z score that compares the observed CD 5 value to those of the same paper or patent in the ten rewired citation networks. Positive z scores indicate that the observed CD 5 value is greater that is more disruptive than would be expected by chance negative z scores indicate that the observed values are lesser that is more consolidating. The results of these analyses are shown in Extended Data Fig. 8 separately for papers Extended Data Fig. 8c and patents Extended Data Fig. 8f. Lines correspond to the average z score among papers or patents published in the focal year. The plots reveal a pattern of change in the CD index over and beyond that baked in to the changing structure of the network. We find that on average papers and patents tend to be less disruptive than would be expected by chance and moreover the gap between the observed CD index values and those from the randomly rewired networks is increasing over time which is consistent with our findings of a decline in disruptive science and technology. Taken together the results of the foregoing analyses suggest that although there have been marked changes in science and technology over the course of our long study window particularly with respect to publication citation and authorship practices the decline in disruptive science and technology that we document using the CD index is unlikely to be an artefact of these changes and instead represents a substantive shift in the nature of discovery and invention. Regression analysis We evaluate the relationship between disruptiveness and the use of previous knowledge using regression models predicting CD 5 for individual papers and patents based on three indicators of previous knowledge usethe diversity of work cited mean number of selfcitations and mean age of work cited. Our measure of the diversity of work cited is measured at the field year level all other variables included in the regressions are defined at the level of the paper or patent. To account for potential confounding factors our models included year and field fixed effects. Year fixed effects account for time variant factors that affect all observations papers or patents equally for example global economic trends. Field fixed effects account for fieldspecific factors that do not change over time for example some fields may intrinsically value disruptive work over consolidating ones. In contrast to our descriptive plots for our regression models we adjust for field effects using the more granular 150 WoS extended subjects for example biochemistry and molecular biology biophysics biotechnology and applied microbiology cell biology developmental biology evolutionary biology and microbiology are extended subjects within the life sciences and biomedicine research area and 38 NBER technology subcategories for example agriculture food textile coating gas organic and resins are subcategories within the chemistry technology category. In addition we also include controls for the mean age of team members that is career age defined as the difference between the publication year of the focal paper or patent and the first year in which each author or inventor published a paper or patent and the mean number of previous works produced by team members. Although increases in rates of selfcitations may indicate that scientists and inventors are becoming more narrowly focused on their own work these rates may also be driven in part by the amount of previous work available for selfciting. Similarly although increases in the age of work cited in papers and patents may indicate that scientists and inventors are struggling to keep up they may also be driven by the rapidly aging workforce in science and technology 7879. For example older scientists and inventors may be more familiar with or more attentive to older work or may actively resist change 80. These control variables help to account for these alternative explanations. Supplementary Table 3 shows summary statistics for variables used in the ordinaryleastsquares regression models. The diversity of work cited is measured by normalized entropy which ranges from 0 to 1. Greater values on this measure indicate a more uniform distribution of citations to a wider range of existing work lower values indicate a more concentrated distribution of citations to a smaller range of existing work. The tables show that the normalized entropy in a given field and year has a nearly maximal average entropy of 0. 98 for both science and technology. About 16 of papers cited in a paper are by an author of the focal paper the corresponding number for patents is about 7. Papers tend to rely on older work and work that varies more greatly in age measured by standard deviation than patents. In addition the average CD 5 of a paper is 0. 04 whereas the average CD 5 of a patent is 0. 12 meaning that the average paper tends to be less disruptive than the average patent. We find that using more diverse work less of ones own work and older work tends to be associated with the production of more disruptive science and technology even after accounting for the average age and number of previous works produced by team members. These findings are based on our regression results shown in Extended Data Table 1. Models 6 and 12 present the full regression models. The models indicate a consistent pattern for both science and technology wherein the coefficients for diversity of work cited are positive and significant for papers 0. 159 P 0. 01 and patents 0. 069 P 0. 01 indicating that in fields in which there is more use of diverse work there is greater disruption. Holding all other variables at their means the predicted CD 5 of papers and patents increases by 303. 5 and 1. 3 respectively when the diversity of work cited increases by 1 s. d. The coefficients of the ratio of selfcitations to total work cited is negative and significant for papers 0. 011 P 0. 01 and patents 0. 060 P 0. 01 showing that when researchers or inventors rely more on their own work discovery and invention tends to be less disruptive. Again holding all other variables at their means the predicted CD 5 of papers and patents decreases by 622. 9 and 18. 5 respectively with a 1 s. d. increase in the ratio. The coefficients of the interaction between mean age of work cited and dispersion in age of work cited is positive and significant for papers 0. 000 P 0. 01 and patents 0. 001 P 0. 01 suggesting thatholding the dispersion of the age of work cited constantpapers and patents that engage with older work are more likely to be disruptive. The predicted CD 5 of papers and patents increases by a striking 2072. 4 and 58. 4 respectively when the mean age of work cited increases by 1 s. d. about nine and eight years for papers and patents respectively again holding all other variables at their means. In summary the regression results suggest that changes in the use of previous knowledge may contribute to the production of less disruptive science and technology.

Extended data figures and tables Extended Data Fig. 1 Distribution of CD 5. This figure gives an overview of the distribution of CD 5 for papers n 24659076 and patents n 3912353. Panels a and c show counts of papers and patents over discrete intervals of CD 5. Panels b and d show the distribution of CD 5 over time within 10 papers and 5 patents year intervals using lettervalue plots. These plots are similar to boxplots but generally provide more reliable summaries for large datasets. They are drawn by identifying the median of the underlying distribution and then recursively drawing boxes outward from there in either direction that encompass half of the remaining data. Extended Data Fig. 2 CD index measured using alternative forward citation windows. This figure evaluates the sensitivity of our results to the use of different forward citation windows when computing the CD index for papers n 24659076 and patents n 3912353. In the main text the index is computed based on citations made to papers and patents and their backward references as of 5 years after the year of publication. a and c plot the CD index using a longer 10 year forward window for papers and patents respectively. b and d plot the CD index using all forward citations made to sample papers and patents as of the year 2017. Shaded bands correspond to 95 confidence intervals. Overall the results mirror those reported in the main text although the decline is somewhat steeper using longer forward citation windows suggesting our primary results may represent a more conservative estimate. Extended Data Fig. 3 Diversity of language use in science and technology over time. This figure shows changes in the ratio of unique to total words also known as the typetoken ratio over time based on data from the abstracts of papers a n 76 WoS research area year observations and patents b n 229 NBER technology category year observations. For papers lines correspond to WoS research areas for patents lines correspond to NBER technology categories. For paper abstracts lines begin in 1992 because WoS does not reliably record abstracts for papers published prior to the early 1990s. The ratio of unique to total words is computed separately by field i. e. the uniqueness of words and total word counts are determined within WoS research areas and NBER technology categories. If disruption is decreasing we may plausibly expect to see a decrease in the diversity of words used by scientists and inventors as discoveries and inventions will be less likely to create departures from the status quo and will therefore be less likely to need to introduce new terminology. For both papers and patents we observe declining diversity in word use over time which is consistent with this expectation and corroborates our findings using the CD index. Extended Data Fig. 4 Declining combinatorial novelty. This figure shows changing patterns in the combinatorial noveltyconventionality of papers a n 24659076 and patents b n 3912353 using a previously proposed measure of atypical combinations 14. The measure quantifies the degree to which the prior work cited by a paper or patent would be expected by chance. For papers we follow prior work 14 and consider combinations of cited journals. If a paper made three citations to prior work and that work was published in three different journals Nature Cell and Sciencethen there are three combinations Nature Cell Nature Science and Science Cell. To determine the degree to which each combination would be expected by chance the frequency of observed pairings is compared to those in 10 rewired copies of the overall citation network using a zscore. For patents there is no natural analogue to journals and therefore we consider pairings of primary United States Patent Classification USPC system codes. We present the results of this analysis following the approach of prior work 14 which plots the cumulative distribution function of the measure. In general there is a rightward shift in the cumulative distributions over time suggesting that for both papers and patents combinations are more conventional than would be expected by chance consistent with what we would anticipate based on our results using the CD index. For patents there is also a smaller shift in the opposite direction on the left side of the distribution suggesting that novel patents in recent decades are somewhat more novel than novel patents in earlier decades. Overall however the bulk of the distribution is moving rightward indicating greater conventionality. Extended Data Fig. 5 Contribution of field year and author effects. This figure shows the relative contribution of field year and author fixed effects to the adjusted R 2 in regression models predicting CD 5. The top bar shows the results for papers n 80607091 paper author observations the bottom bar shows the results for patents n 8319826 patent inventor observations. The results suggest that for both papers and patents stable characteristics of authors contribute significantly to patterns of disruptiveness. Moreover relatively little of the variation is accounted for by fieldspecific factors. Extended Data Fig. 6 CD index over time across data sources. This figure shows changes in CD 5 over time across four additional data sources the WoS n 24659076 and Patents View n 3912353 lines are included for reference JSTOR n 1703353 the American Physical Society corpus n 478373 Microsoft Academic Graph n 1000000 and PubMed n 16774282. Colours indicate the six different data sources. Shaded bands correspond to 95 confidence intervals. The figure indicates that the decline in disruption is unlikely to be driven by our sample choice of WoS papers and Patents View patents. Extended Data Fig. 7 Alternative measures of disruption. This figure shows the decline in the disruption of papers a n 100000 and patents b n 100000 based on two alternative measures of disruption. The blue lines calculate disruption using a measure proposed in Bornmann et al. 13 DIlnok where l 5 which makes the measure more resilient to marginal changes in the number of papers or patents that only cite the focal works references. The orange lines calculate disruption using a measure proposed in Leydesdorff et al. 15 DI which makes the measure less sensitive to small changes in the forward citation patterns of papers or patents that make no backward citations. Shaded bands correspond to 95 confidence intervals. With both alternative measures we observe decreases in disruption for papers and patents suggesting that the decline is not an artefact of our operationalization of disruption. Extended Data Fig. 8 Robustness to changes in publication citation and authorship practices. This figure evaluates whether declines in disruptiveness may be attributable to changes in publication citation and authorship practices for papers n 24659076 and patents n 3912353. Panels a and d adjust for these changes using a normalization approach. We present two alternative versions of the CD index both of which account for the tendency for papers and patents to cite more prior work over time. Blue lines indicate normalization at the paper level accounting for the number of citations made by the focal paperpatent. Orange lines indicate normalization at the field and year level accounting for the mean number of citations made by paperspatents in the focal field and year. Panels b papers and e patents adjust for changes in publication citation and authorship practices using a regression approach. The panels show predicted values of CD 5 based on regressions reported in Models 4 papers and 8 patents of Supplementary Table 1 which adjust for field year Number of new paperspatents Mean number of paperspatents cited Mean number of authorsinventors per paperpatentand paperpatentlevel Number of paperspatents cited Number of unlinked referencescharacteristics. Predictions are made separately for each year indicator included in the models we then connect these separate predictions with lines to aid interpretation. Finally Panels c papers and f patents adjust for changes in publication citation and authorship practices using a simulation approach. The panels plot zscores that compare values of CD 5 obtained from the observed citation networks to those obtained from randomly rewired copies of the observed networks. Across all six panels shaded bands correspond to 95 confidence intervals. Extended Data Fig. 9 Growth of scientific and technological knowledge. This figure shows the number of papers n 24659076 published a and patents n 3912353 granted b over time. For papers lines correspond to WoS research areas for patents lines correspond to NBER technology categories.
