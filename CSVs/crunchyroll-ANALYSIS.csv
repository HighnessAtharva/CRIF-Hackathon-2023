If thats the case you can fix it with some quick adjustments to your browser settings or by clearing your cache. JUMP TO KEY SECTIONS Why is Crunchyroll showing a black screen This is most likely an issue with the Chrome browser. As a rule the Crunchyroll black screen wont happen when using the mobile app or if youre watching on a smart TV. Rather this is a problem limited to streaming via an internet browser specifically Google Chrome. We havent heard of this happening on other browsers or inapp so if thats the issue youve run into let us know. So why is Crunchyroll showing a black screen on Chrome The short answer is that this is a glitch with Chromes settings or firmware. But lets break that down in a bit more detail. There are a few reasons Chrome might interrupt your anime with a black screen. Specifically four different things might be going wrong Extension incompatibility Cache buildup Popup redirects Bad internet connection How to fix Crunchyroll black screen issues It wont always be immediately obvious which of these problems is causing a black screen but heres how to deal with each problem. Extension incompatibility Crunchyroll isnt compatible with all Chrome browser extensions unfortunately. That means the black screen may be caused by one of your extensions disagreeing with the streaming service. The fix is pretty easy Go to Settings Click on Extensions Turn off all extensions Refresh your Crunchyroll page If the extensions are the problem youll be back in business after following these steps. If youre still getting the black screen its time to try one of the other fixes below. Cache buildup When you use the internet your browser stores a lot of information and sometimes that stored information called the cache can make it hard for programs to run.

Heres how to do that Go to Settings Select Privacy and security Click on Site settings Select Popups and redirects Add Crunchyroll under sites allowed to send popups and redirects Refresh your Crunchyroll page Bad internet connection The last and perhaps most obvious reason you might encounter a black screen on Crunchyroll is a problem with your internet connection. If the issue isnt with your internet provider you may just need to reboot your modem Turn off or unplug your modem and router Wait about 30 seconds to two minutes Turn your modem back on Turn your router back on Refresh your Crunchyroll page once your modem and router lights indicate that you have a signal Read more The best anime apps for Android FAQs Youre probably encountering a problem with Google Chrome.

The Show Trigun Where You Can Stream It Hulu Crunchyroll Funimation The Pitch Trigun is a western space manga created by Yasuhiro Nightow. It originally ran for three volumes from 1995 to 1997 then was quickly revived as Trigun Maximum running for another 14 volumes until 2008. Trigun Stampede the second anime adaptation is set to premiere this January. Why wait though The first 26episode anime which first aired in 1998 is available to watch and still holds up. Trigun is set in the far future on the planet Gunsmoke which is like Arrakis from Dune mixed with the old American west. Our POV characters are Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson two agents from the Bernardelli Insurance Society. The pair has been assigned to track down Vash the Stampede a lone gunman whose head carries a bounty of 60 billion double dollars and keep him from causing any damage to Bernardelli clients properties. Reputed for his destructive cityleveling capabilities Vash is known as the Humanoid Typhoon. However as they get roped into one misadventure after the next Meryl and Milly discover that Vash is not what they expected. Why its essential viewing Triguns artwork conjures up an image of Vash as a stoic badass gunslinger but nothing is further from the truth Hes really an airheaded goofball with a love for donuts. Despite wielding three guns two handheld revolvers and a third one he conceals in his cybernetic right arm hes a pacifist who refuses to kill even the worst of his enemies. Vashs adoptive mother Rem taught him that no one has the right to take the life of another person and hes carried that belief with him ever since. While people fear him due to his dreaded reputation Vash is really all about love and peace. The first episodes of Trigun are lowstakes standalone stories. Theyre centered around different bounty hunters trying to capture Vash but focusing on the charm of the characters. Vash is a lovable hero from the getgo while the shortfused Meryl and the ditzy goodhearted Milly are a hilarious comedic duo. Things pick up in episode 5 when Meryl finally realizes that the goofy troublemaker she and Milly have been running into is really the Vash the Stampede. From there we start to learn more about Vashs background. Episode 6 focuses on the vengeful pursuit of a young girl whose city he seemingly destroyed while episodes 78 are the first to hint at his past with Rem. Episode 9 introduces Nicholas D. Wolfwood a wandering gunslinging priest who sometimes travels with the three leads. His introduction is when the stakes and themes of Trigun cement themselves. The limits of pacifism There are a lot of fictional heroes with codes against killing. In anime there are Elric brothers from Fullmetal Alchemist Doctor Kenzo Tenma from Monster and more. In America codes against killing are a staple of superheroes like Batman. Vash fits right in with them only hes in the dogeatdogworld of Gunsmoke so his commitment to his ideals continues to be tested. A group of cyborg mercenaries called the GungHo Guns are after Vash and not for the bounty on his head their leader has a score to settle with the Humanoid Typhoon. As the series goes on he fails to save more and more people from these villains. In episode 19 hes faced with a man who wants to murder his daughters killer but has no easy answer for him. Then there are questions where theres no right answer do you save a butterfly from a spider knowing that doing so condemns the spider to starvation The way Trigun addresses these themes is not just philosophical but theological. Yasuhiro Nightow has been described as a Christian convert who was raised Buddhist while studying Catholicism later converting. Though its unclear if he currently practices. In any case Trigun manga traffics in Christian themes which carry over into the anime. Most obviously Wolfwood wields an enormous crossshaped gun that he carries on his back. Vashs refusal to kill is right in line with Church doctrine Thou shalt not kill because everyone deserves forgiveness. The series is designed to test his faith in those beliefs in Rems beliefs and Vashs answer comes when he finally squares off with that mysterious face from his past. His conclusion is the keystone of an ending Id dare call perfect.,"

The NieR Automata anime has locked in a premiere date for January 7 2023 in Japan. A few trailers have been dropping over the holidays for the upcoming anime adaptation of 2017s NieR Automata. The first features 2B and 9S fairly prominently as two leads well be following in the Ver. 1. 1a anime. Another new trailer today shows off some of the supporting cast as well as the opening and ending tracks for the series. Both trailers have a January 7 premiere date set for the adaptation. We already knew it was arriving sometime in January but it looks like the date is much sooner in the month than one might have expected. Most of the adaptation is covering some familiar territory given what we see in the trailers. There is one character Lily who appears in the lore but seems to be playing a larger role in the anime. Itll be interesting to see how much this Ver 1. 1a diverges from the game. Become as gods The series looks set to air on Crunchyroll as well as other platforms though exact distribution plans and dates arent clear just yet. Well have to see just what the global rollout looks like as the series goes live. NieR Automata isnt the only video game adaptation kicking off in January 2023 either. HBOs The Last of Us is set to debut not too long after on January 15 2023. And the animated Dragon Age Absolution just recently went live on Netflix too. Its quite the time for video game adaptations and theres even more on the way. Hopefully they can turn out as well as shows like Arcane and Cyberpunk Edgerunners have.,"

This is the first time Im even going to attempt to talk about it given how utterly bonkers this show is even in the grand scheme of all the weirdness anime can offer. Every single week this show does something that leaves me floored. Ive struggled writing about it at all because I mean what even is this show which stars a man who can only be described as too horny to die who also happens to possess a devil heart that makes chainsaws erupt from has armsand face when he needs to do battle. Im not sure you could have expected any less from a show called Chainsaw Man after all. The plot of Chainsaw Man is that Denji becomes fused with his pet Chainsaw Devil after it dies and this has transformed him into an immortal killing machine. He joins a special government division meant to hunt down Devils sometimes using humans like Aki a subdued hunter trying to seek revenge on a specific Devil or Power a partdemon fiend who is entirely unstable and just enjoys killing things with bloodbased abilities. Denjis motivations aresimplistic at best. He joins the Devil Hunters because they will give him food and a place to stay which in his transient life before he did not have. But soon his motivation turns to goals relating to sex. First he wants to touch a breast. Then he wants to sleep with his boss Makima. Its kind of gross but it makes him a weirdly unique character in that Ive never seen a protagonist who truly just did not care that he was a protagonist and not bothered with a specific redemption arc or revenge fantasy. Aki plays that role instead and most other characters we meet Makima Kobeni are odd mysteries that the show will expand on in time. I thought Demon Slayer was doing interesting things with its enemy design but the Devils here in Chainsaw Man are something else entirely. Some are human adjacent and rather tame like the Angel Devil whos only power is shortening human lifespan if you touch them. But then there are Devils like Snake and Ghost which demand bodily sacrifices each time theyre summoned in combat. An eye a fingernail. In one case the entirety of a person. There seems to be some sort of social commentary lurking in the shadows of this truly bizarre series as the Big Bad antagonist of this season is the Gun Devil a massive Devil responsible for a hugescale terrorist attack in America and its followers are armed with guns and ammo a big nono in mostly gunfree Japan. The Gun Devil is whats motivating both Aki and Denji. Aki because it killed people he loved Denji because Makima has promised herself to him if he kills it. The thing is Im told by Chainsaw Man manga fans that this is only the tip of the iceberg and things are going to get way way weirder from here. I just watched a woman remotely squish entire human beings by reading their name off a piece of paper and things are going to get weirder Well suffice to say I am certainly going to stick around for that. Chainsaw Man is a unique weird and wild anime series thats unlike anything Ive seen before. I dont know if I can recommend it to everyone but Ive never had a show make my jaw drop each episode like this one has. A truly oneofakind experience. Follow me on Twitter YouTube and.

Vinland Saga Season Two is now streaming on Crunchyroll as well as the first season for the first time The visually stunning Viking epic now produced by MAPPA the studio behind Chainsaw Man JUJUTSU KAISEN and Attack on Titan Final Season will air new episodes weekly every Monday at 1130 AM ET 830 AM PT on Crunchyroll. Adapted from the epic manga series by Makoto Yukimura Vinland Saga tells the story of young Viking Thorfinn who witnesses the murder of his legendary tribal chief father and sets out on a journey of revenge only to end up following his fathers killer Askeladds band of mercenary raiders becoming increasingly unstoppable as a warrior and killer in hopes of killing Askeladd in a duel. The story goes beyond Thorfinns quest for vengeance especially when his journey takes him to faraway lands and gets him involved with King Canute and the unfolding of historical events. What happens when there is no more revenge to be had and Thorfinn has to face the death and destruction he caused in his wake The rest of Vinland Saga deals with the next chapter of Thorfinns life. A new millennium begins in the southern part of the Jutland peninsula in Denmark. After the death of his longtime enemy Askeladd Thorfinn lost his purpose in life. He was bought by the landowner Ketil as a slave and engaged in land reclamation work on his farm. Thorfinn meets a young man there Einar who was also a slave like him. The encounter with Einar led Thorfinn to face the sins he had committed and began to find meaning in life. On the other hand Canute who became the King of England attempted to extend his territory for the establishment of the promised land. This is The Story of a True Warrior Saga. The story of Atonement and Salvation Saga that lies beyond the prologue. Thorfinns quest for redemption and his turn to pacifism actually feels more like a Japanese preoccupation than a Scandinavian one but theres nothing wrong with that. Japanese creators are frequently using the historical sagas of other cultures to find themes and ideas dear to themselves to explore and Vinland Saga is a meticulously researched and drawn story to make the long journey feel earned.

13,The State Of The Nintendo Switch In 2022,"Pokémon saved the Switch in 2022, which was also the year that the console officially started to feel old.Read more...",https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-pro-pokemon-scarlet-violet-arceus-2022-1849916169,Pokmon saved the Switch in 2022 which was also the year that the console officially started to feel old. As we approach the Switchs sixth anniversary it feels like Nintendos innovative hybrid gaming device has finally peaked and is now on the decline. Missing features and poor online experiences that were once easier to forgive have started to feel more frustrating. Even the latest visually impressive firstparty games like Kirby And The Forgotten Land and Xenoblade Chronicles 3 struggled to mask the hardwares aging limitations. Dont get me wrong. The Switchs release calendar was still lowkey stacked month in and month out. The OLED version continues to bring out a level of vibrancy in games big and small that helps make up for some of the technical drawbacks. And despite never receiving a price drop since it launched the Switch remains an extremely competitive gaming option when stacked up against pricier alternatives like the PS5 Xbox Series X and Steam Deck. Still a meaningful hardware refresh has never felt more overdue. 2022 was the year of the missing Switch Pro and the year it felt like Nintendos existing handheld hybrid went from punching above its weight to underdelivering on the promise of its core conceit. Vertagear 800 Series Gaming Chair Ergonomic comfort Adjustable seat height neck support memory foam pillow adjustable back rest and tilt locking system and 4D armrests that move in 4 directions to fit you best. Great games chugging hardware Nintendo made up for The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom being delayed this year through sheer quantity of new releases. On the firstparty side Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch Sports Mario Strikers Battle League and Fire Emblem Warriors Three Hopes anchored the first half of the year while Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Splatoon 3 and Bayonetta 3 delivered heavyhitters in the second half. Gaps were stuffed with many of the years biggest indie games Sifu Citizen Sleeper Nobody Saves the World Return to Monkey Island OlliOlli World Shredders Revenge Tunic and Neon White. Square Enixs 2022 JRPG bonanza was well represented including Switch exclusives Live a Live and Triangle Strategy. Plus big ports like No Mans Sky Personal 5 Royal and Nier Automata brought over some of the best games of the last console generation. Its safe to say however that it might have still felt like one of the quieter years on Switch if not for Pokmon Arceus Legends Pokmon Scarlet and Violet. In addition to selling tons both games also perfectly represented the platforms growing pains this year they iterated on the series tried and true collectathon formula in creative and refreshing ways while also looking like ass and running badly. On the Arceus side the games open world often looked empty and flat. On the Scarlet and Violet side framerate drops constant popin of objects and rogue glitches held back an otherwise ambitious new blueprint for the future of the mainline Pokmon games. Its hard to know how much these shortcomings are due to the Switchs old chipsets a lack of development time a particular set of design tradeoffs or some combination of those and other factors. A modern spec sheet probably wouldnt hurt though. Even Xenoblade Chronicles 3 a sprawling RPG with big open environments that look much better than what youll find in Pokmon brushed up against the limits of the Switch. The frame rate was far from stable in the later half of the game and the sweeping vistas themselves lose all sorts of detail and definition the second you move away from them. This didnt stop Monoliths game from feeling and looking great when in motion but it does mean that almost every screenshot I have from my time with it is full of jagged edges and washed out textures. Bayonetta 3 was even worse. Switch Online is still a drag Another game that gets at the increasing duality of the Switch is Splatoon 3. A gorgeous and colorful sequel with even more content and features it nevertheless is held back by Nintendos online infrastructure. Its 2022. Splatoon 3 is one of the best competitive shooters out there. And you will almost certainly spend at least part of any gaming session mired in disconnects or other connectivity woes. Its especially notable considering some of the biggest shooters around like Fortnite and Apex Legends are also on Switch and those games also dont require players to download a separate app to use voice chat. These problems were easier to ignore when Nintendos online service was free but as the company continues to doubledown on its monthly subscription service subpar online performance continues to be a sore spot. Last year Nintendo launched the Switch Online Expansion Pack a 50 version of the service that raised the price in exchange for access to Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis games as well as various bits of Switch DLC. It felt like a terrible deal at the time and nothing over the past 12 months has done much to change that. Thats not to say that Nintendo hasnt been diligently filling out the Netflixstyle retro library. Notable additions included Earthbound Shining Force II and The Legend of Zelda Majoras Mask. In total Switch Online received five more NES games six more SNES games 17 more Genesis games and 11 more N64 games this year. Game Boy Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games remain MIA however as do notable thirdparty SNES titles like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI. As rival services like PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass expand and evolve to include some of the biggest new releases and cloud gaming its hard not to look at Switch Online and feel like it comes up short despite being significantly cheaper. Switch Online did experiment with weeklong free trials for games like Splatoon 2 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe this year as well as add a new Switch Online missions and rewards feature but four years into the services life it still feels like its struggling to justify itself. Netflix is never coming If Switch Online still seems like an underwhelming value proposition the base console user experience remains absolutely barebones. The Switch firmware received six updates in 2022 and the only notable feature added was Groups which allows players to organize their game libraries into folders. Its nice to have and was long overdue which mostly serves to underline just how little the rest of the console experience has changed since launch. Despite the popularity of the Switch Nintendo has never prioritized social featuresand that didnt change in 2022. Theres no way to search for friends send them messages or gift them games. Theres no social feed to speak of when it comes to wondering what they are playing buying or sharing. Again this has been the status quo but as each new year passes the fact that the Switch hasnt improved on any of it becomes more glaring. The apps never came this year either. For years the joke was that you could get Netflix on every modern Nintendo device but the Switch. The streaming wars are in full swing with services like Game Pass including complimentary subscriptions to Apple TV and Disney neither of which exist on Switch. Hulu remains the lone exception joined last year by Funimaiton and this year by Crunchyroll. The Switch has been outpaced by app integration in other areas as well. Spotify has been a mainstay on PlayStation and Xbox for years while social hub Discord was finally added to both this past year. Neither are on Nintendos platform which is especially surprising considering how many communication shortcomings would be solved by the arrival of Discord. The Switch didnt get achievements or home screen themes in 2022 either. SoSwitch Pro when When the Switch released in 2017 holding games like The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey in your hands and taking them on the go was a powerful revelation. In 2022 thanks to the bar already raised by Nintendo half a decade ago its somewhat less novel. At the lowend an explosion in cloud gaming peripherals and thirdparty handhelds means you can stream Assassins Creed Valhalla alongside Dead Cells to a bunch of competitors portables. The experience isnt great but its often good enough. At the highend Valves Steam Deck went from a trickle of preorders to ondemand availability and let people take Steam hits from The Witcher 3 to Vampire Survivors to the bathroom and beyond. Its clunky the battery life isnt great and its a much less streamlined user experience than the Switch. Valve is also selling the device at a big loss. And yet while its only sold less than 2 percent as many units as the Switch so far its shown the massive leap handheld gaming is capable of since the latter first shipped. While Kotaku has mentioned a mythical Switch Pro in every State of the Switch review since 2018 this is the year it went from when is it coming to where the hell is it Many fans expected Nintendo to reveal upgraded hardware at E3 2021. Instead it revealed the Switch OLED a fancy screen atop the same basic guts for 50 more. This led to a lot of questions about repeated Bloomberg reports that Nintendo was gearing up to release a 4K successor to the Switch but Nintendos past history alone says were due for a new Switch. The Nintendo DS launched in 2004. The DS Lite followed in 2006. The DSi in 2008. And the DSi XL in 2009. The first and last iterations of the device showed a long range in terms of improvement. The 3DS launched in 2011. A 3DS XL arrived the following year. A 2DS was added to the lineup the year after that. And a New Nintendo 3DS and 3DS XL launched the year after that both of which notably played a handful of games the earlier versions of the system couldnt run. The Switch is already two years older than the PS4 was when the PS4 Pro came out and older than the Wii U was when the Switch launched. The global pandemic which created shortages for semiconductors that affected everything from cars to smartphones no doubt threw any traditional timeline for a Switch Pro out the window. At the same time that hasnt stopped the Switch from continuing to age in the interim. From JoyCon drift to finicky WiFi reception the console has succeeded despite notable design flaws and shortcomings thanks to its brilliant form factor and exclusives. The form factor is becoming less and less of a differentiator though and despite the development wizardry at Nintendo old hardware is starting to catch up with it. Well see if 2023s Tears of the Kingdom can replicate the magic of Breath of the Wild on a six year old machine.

It has been an incredibly twisted ride from episode one that has managed to make the viewers feel a range of emotions in a span of 23 minutes from heartbreak to laughter to just complete horror this show has pulled no punches in its first season. It has been a strong and fantastic season that keeps viewers on their toes at every single point. The videos Studio MAPPA has released so far spotlight several characters we have met so far Aki Himeno Kobeni Power and my favorite Pochita. Each of their videos shows a little summary of who they are at their core their vulnerability and their strength. I think there is one big similarity within the characters we have been presented with so far they all seem to have a pretty troubled past two have met a pretty tragic ending and one has a tragic death in his future. I am not the biggest fan of Himeno because as she explained herself what she proposed to do with Denji well not quite legal so I struggle to like her as she used sexuality to control Denji the way Makima does. Regarding Kobeni meh but I guess after being forced to go into prostitution or devil hunting to pay for your brothers studies might do that to someone. I love Aki I always want to hug him. And Pochita Well it reminds me of my pup so of course I am biased toward the cute puppy. There have also been some games and collectibles announcements as well as character posters see above released over at Chainsaw Man EN Twitter Chainsaw Fiend Denji Pochita Power Aki Kobeni Makima Kishibe and Himeno. I wonder if there might be character videos of the remaining few. That said I also wonder if there is a connection or if this is in preparation for what is to come. With the finale approaching next week it has been impossible to not wonder about the future of the anime especially after some complaints and requests from different studios or voice actors. Personally I have been enjoying every second of this anime so far and it has made me like the story far more than the manga did. I cannot wait to see where things lead and how things will move along for future arcs.,The State Of The Nintendo Switch In 2022,Extremely Positive,640,"decline, poor, frustrating, struggled, limitations, wrong, drawbacks, pricier, overdue, conceit, delayed, Revenge, pains, badly, rogue, glitches, hard, shortcomings, lack, hurt, limits, lose, jagged, worse, problems, ignore, terrible, rival, hard, struggling, overdue, joke, lone, Discord, shortcomings, Discord, Dead, clunky, loss, doubt, finicky, shortcomings","Fire, ass, explosion, hell",lawsuit
15,Tokyo Revengers Season 2 Finds its New Streaming Home,"After streaming the first season of Tokyo Revengers on Crunchyroll, Kodansha finds a new streaming partner for the second season of its hit anime.",https://screenrant.com/tokyo-revengers-season-2-new-streaming-hulu/,While Kodanshas fanfavorite manga series officially concluded in November 2022 the epic timetravel gangster saga will not be disappearing from the publics view anytime soon especially with the anime gearing up for its second run. Tokyo Revengers Now in a trailer for season 2 released on Youtube its been officially announced that Tokyo Revengers is coming to Hulu in the United States and Disney in Japan. Fans in Japan will be able to view the new season on Disney Japan beginning on Sunday January 8 2023 while fans in the United States will be able to see the new season on Hulu beginning on Saturday January 7 2023. There is precedent for this as the streaming rights to Bleach ThousandYear Blood War are similarly split. The new streaming framework highlights how much the anime world has changed since Tokyo Revengers first season streamed on Crunchyroll. Over that time the popularity of anime has exploded. On the one hand anime content creators like Kodansha have been eager to find and expand the markets for their stories. On the other hand companies like Disney which lack robust anime content have been eager to get more anime into their networks as a way of attracting more customers. It was no surprise when Disney and Kodansha announced an expanded collaborative partnership that not only will lead to the coproduction of original anime content but also gives Disney exclusive rights to anime adaptations of Kodanshas manga titles. In consideration of the fact that Kodanshas Shonen Weekly Magazine is perhaps the second most popular manga content generator in Japan Disneys anime problem has been largely resolved. Moreover Kodansha gets to popularize its content with a global cartoon entertainment titan. The distribution of Tokyo Revengers on Disney and Hulu is the first major act of the new venture. What To Expect From Tokyo Revengers Season 2 As suggested in the announcement video the new season of Tokyo Revengers looks like it will focus on the mangas Christmas Showdown story arc. In the arc the series protagonist Takemichi Hanagaki once again tries to change the present timeline where his friends still end up being killed by the same Tokyo street gang he thought he neutralized in his last return to the past. Not surprisingly in his next timeleap Takemichi focuses on trying to undo those past events namely the merger of the Black Dragon and Tokyo Revengers Tokyo Manij gangs that he previously did not know was needed to change the future. Takemichis machinations lead to a Christmas Eve confrontation between the Black Dragons and the Tokyo Meiji gangs that has a significant impact on both the past and present timelines. While the Christmas Showdown arc is an important chapter in the Tokyo Revengers saga it is far from the end of the story. Judging from the popularity of the original manga and the animes first season it wouldnt be surprising to see a third season of get greenlit. Indeed Kodanshas move to make the anime it first collaboration with Disney suggests it has big plans for the anime going forward.

19,2022 Was a Ridiculously Good Year for TV. These Are the Best Shows - CNET,CNET rounds up our top TV picks.,https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/2022-was-a-ridiculously-good-year-for-tv-these-are-the-best-shows/,2022 was an amazing year for television. I probably said that last year and maybe even the year before but facts are facts. Television has never been better. This year however was especially compelling for its variety. Bigbudget shows like House of the Dragon delivered but we also got compelling scifi with The Peripheral genius comedies like Bad Sisters and subversive anime like Spy X Family. Even the downinthedoldrums Star Wars franchise got itself a genuine masterpiece in Andor. So without further ado and in no particular order here are the CNET crews favorite shows of 2022. Read more CNETs favorite movies of 2022 Andor Ive fantasized about living in the Star Wars universe for decades who hasnt and Andor reveals what itd actually be like. In this show youll forget that this is a galaxy run by a space wizard that shoots lightning from his fingers. Instead youll be focused on the grinding reality of life under an oppressive regimes boot the danger of trying to climb its corporate ladder and the power of collective action in facing overwhelming odds. Getting to follow Diego Luna on the path to becoming his morally gray Rogue One hero is a treat but Andors real joys are the unseen tales of rebels Imperials and one unnervingly obsessed space cop. Andor is the best Star Wars story since The Empire Strikes Back. Sean Keane House of the Dragon House of the Dragon was the most pleasant TV surprise of 2022. Yes the show has pacing issues and some episodes were way too dark. But think back to the beginning of the year when House of the Dragon was a mystery. Considering the foul taste Game of Thrones eighth season left in many mouths there was an undeniable inclination to think House of the Dragon would inherit the worst attributes from its predecessor and few of its strengths. House of the Dragon is different enough from Game of Thrones to stand on its own but similar enough to remind you of why you loved Game of Thrones in the first place. Thats a big win. Dan Van Boom Cyberpunk Edgerunners Some shows just have no right being good. Cyberpunk Edgerunners an anime based on an ambitious buggy video game the internet dunked on for months shouldnt be one of the best TV shows of 2022 but it is. Easily. The end result of a collab between game developer CD Projekt Red and Studio Trigger Cyberpunk Edgerunners is a neondrenched exercise in pure hyperstyle. Its as good as any anime Ive watched in the last decade. A compact welltold story about the consequences of poverty and the pursuit of pure capital at all costs. I suspect Ill be watching and rewatching this masterpiece for years to come. Mark Serrels Bad Sisters This superb Irish black comedy comes from the pen of prolific sitcom writer Sharon Horgan Pulling Catastrophe Motherland. Four sisters plot to kill their brotherinlaw JeanPaul after he mistreats each of them including his wife Grace. JeanPaul is possibly one of the greatest villains on TV his pet name for Grace Mammy will haunt your days long after you down this insane cocktail of murder mystery comedy thriller. An absolute gem. Jen Bisset The White Lotus season 2 HBO closed out the year with seven weeks of sweet sweet schadenfreude making me long for the proverbial water cooler so I could dissect each The White Lotus characters likelihood of dying. This seasons richpeople playground a resort in Sicily with requisite crashing waves on craggy shores crumbling palazzi and influential local families. Throw in a couple of enterprising sex workers some spouseswapping and drug induced foibles and you got yourself some appointment television. Not only did the sophomore season of The White Lotus bring the denizens of Twitter together in delicious shared suspense it was also just an extremely well made entry into the prestige TV canon with oniony layers of subtext and an embarrassment of Emmyworthy performances. Karisa Langlo The Bear Ive never worked in the food industry and The Bear showed I made the right decision. This frantic HuluDisney Plus sliceoflife drama played like an extended panic attack yet managed to also be funny and ultimately heartwarming. Anchored by winning performances from Ayo Edebiri an incendiary Ebon MossBachrach and Jeremy Allen Whites tight white Tshirt The Bear irresistibly cooked up a portrait of a work family you couldnt help rooting for. Yes chef Richard Trenholm Severance In the heart of an Omicron winter that removed me from family and friends yet again as I wrestled with feelings of living a remote work life and coming back to an office that felt alien to me Severance arrived like a psychological tuning fork to resonate with everything I needed. Apple TV Plus breakout critical hit show got me from the first trailers its bleak absurd retro style which reminded me of everything from Netflixs Maniac to Charlie Kaufman movies like Being John Malkovich. The idea of workers finding their home and work lives severed from each other didnt floor me I have a high ceiling for weirdness. But the tone the relentless commitment to the unfolding mystery is unforgettably hypnotic. I played the video game The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe shortly after and found it spoke to similar obsessions a sense of time vanishing life repeating mental anguish and fighting repression and depression. Also Severance is fun. The cast is stellar and I could watch them all forever. Its slyly funny far more than I thought it would be. The ending of season 1 let me down only because I was ready for this to go so much further. I guess thats what season 2 is for. Scott Stein The Peripheral Some science fiction shows disappoint me. As a lifelong William Gibson fan whos read all his work I expected The Peripheral an adaption of Gibsons 2015 book thats part of a threevolume trilogy to let me down. It didnt. The Prime Video series is everything I could want disorienting storylines strange near and fartherfuture settings and plenty of big ideas robotic telepresence technological time travel made this mustview TV for me. The idea of people jumping into other bodies using VRlike telepresence devices is something Ive obsessed over since Avatar and still feels ahead of its time. But The Peripheral gets a lot odder than that. My wife got hooked too which is no easy feat. We dont always agree on shows but The Peripheral works as a reflection on our cracked broken current world fears of disasters yet to come and also serves as a good tangled scifi actionthriller. I was truly sad to be left on a Season One cliffhanger but Season Two already promises to be very interesting. If you want more just go read Gibsons two books that are already available. Scott Stein Abbott Elementary All hail Quinta Brunson creator star and Emmywinning writer of this hit comedy. Set at a Philadelphia public school thats predominantly Black the mockumentary series follows a handful of teachers and their social media influencer of a principal Janelle James who are just trying to do the best for their kids with the very limited resources they have. Sheryl Lee Ralph who plays veteran teacher Barbara also won an Emmy this year. And if theres an award for best acceptance speech ever give her that one too. Abbott Elementary is that rare show thats hilarious and heartwarming. Just try to keep up with all the pop culture references. Plus Gritty guest stars. Enough said. Anne Dujmovic The Last Movie Stars In the 80s Paul Newman embarked on a memoir project. Friend and screenwriter Stewart Stern conducted interviews with the actor and those closest to him including wife Joanne Woodward directors famous friends and even his exwife. Newman later abandoned the project and burned the audiotapes but thousands of pages of transcripts survived. This sixpart documentary series about legendary actors Newman and Woodward uses those transcripts to take a loving yet unvarnished look at the couple their public and private lives and their 50year marriage. Actor Ethan Hawke who directed the series brilliantly weaves film clips together with voiceovers from the likes of George Clooney reciting Newmans words and Laura Linney reading as Woodward among other wellknown actors. Hawke also includes excerpts of his Zoom interviews with the actors he recruited as well as the children of the iconic Hollywood couple while he was putting the series together. The words compelling and Zoom meetings arent words youd expect to see in the same sentence. But these meetings are just that giving viewers a window into Hawkes creative process as he wrestles with how to tackle a project of this magnitude and during a pandemic too. Anne Dujmovic Barry When I first started watching Barry I thought the goal of executive producers Bill Hader and Alec Berg was to create a wacky comedy about a hitman trying to become an actor. Now Im convinced Barry is one of the best shows on television. During the shows run The Ringer had a weekly recap with Hader on The Prestige TV Podcast. You could listen Hader breaking down complex shots and deep subject matter almost nonchalantly. He broke down his inspiration for certain elements of the story discussing how writers on the show would solve plot puzzles while making sure the show was still funny throughout. Watching season 3 had me saying to myself time and time again that this show shouldnt be this good but it is. Oscar Gonzales SAS Rogue Heroes I was laid up sick a couple of weeks ago so a show about World War II commandos from the guy who wrote Peaky Blinders was a perfectly timed guilty pleasure. Rogue Heroes took the rousing heroics of Saturday afternoon classics like The Great Escape and The Guns of Navarone and mashed it up with the anarchic energy of Inglourious Basterds plus ACDC on the soundtrack. I smashed the whole series in a day. Yes I am a middleaged dad why do you ask Richard Trenholm Extraordinary Attorney Woo Magical. That may sound ridiculous but thats what comes to mind when I think about this South Korean legal dramacomedy series. When you enter the world of Woo Youngwoo you enter a world where a charming quirky young woman who has autism spectrum disorder is forced to challenge people and societys idea of normal every single day. The magic comes from watching Woo Youngwoo be herself she makes mistakes she misses social cues she answers questions literally she follows routines that comfort her but annoy others. She also wins case after case because shes a brilliant and original thinker with a strong sense of justice who cares deeply about people a counter to a persistent stereotype that individuals with ASD are emotionally disconnected. Theres also magic in watching her family friends and colleagues slowly overcome their prejudices and to the series creators credit become characters as fully fleshed out as our heroine. At a time when it seems the bad guys win more than they should watching Woo Youngwoo win legal battles and friends just makes you feel good. The 16episode season 1 with a soundtrack that reminds me of the music from Pixars WallE was one of the most popular international series on Netflix in 2022. Watch it with the subtitles on. You want to hear from these characters in their own voices. Connie Guglielmo Wednesday If after the Addams Family movies and 60s TV series you felt Wednesday deserved a show of her own youre not being kooky or mysterious or spooky. Directed by Tim Burton the eightpart Netflix teen melodrama series follows the nihilistic Wednesdays adventures as shes expelled from one school her eighth in five years and moves on to Nevermore Academy her parents alma mater. While the school is filled with outcasts and monsters of all varieties Wednesday a role Jenna Ortega kills still manages to stand out with her pale skin and black uniform. Shes allergic to color explains her mother Morticia played by Catherine ZetaJones. Wednesdays flat appearance and clear and witty disdain for her peers will keep you in stitches but theres a mystery to solve something is killing off students and townsfolk in the small town of nearby Jericho. The whole family plays supporting roles including Thing the disembodied hand that can now roam freely as Wednesdays sidekick sleuth. Christina Ricci who played Wednesday in the Addams Family movies of the 1990s returns to the story as Marylin Thornhill the schools only normie or nonmagical teacher who serves as Wednesdays dorm mother and sometime mentor. Steven Musil Better Call Saul This Breaking Bad spinoff took a onenote side character drug cartel lawyer Saul Goodman through six seasons of increasingly criminal mayhem to create one of the most multifaceted TV characters of the decade. In his last season Saul aka James McGill aka Slippin Jimmy aka Viktor St. Claire aka Gene Takavic finally met up with Walter White and Jesse said farewell to Kim Wexler Mike Ehrmentraut and Howard Hamlin and received his ultimate judgment in a series finale that hit all the perfect notes. Better Call Sauls final season delivered twists suspense and a well executed resolution that dipped expertly back and forth between multiple timelines before during and after Breaking Bad. An understated turn by comedy legend Carol Burnett as an elderly mark who brings about Sauls downfall was one of several deft guest performances this season. A love story disguised as a crime thriller Better Call Saul was all about Jimmy and Kim in the end and the shows inevitable heartbreaking conclusion put a fitting bow on their absolute disaster of a relationship. Peter Butler Magpie Murders If youre looking for a whodunit done right try this delightful timetraveling murder mystery based on Anthony Horowitzs 2016 bestselling book of the same name. Its storywithinastory format investigates the suspicious death of successful mystery writer Alan Conway while simultaneously unfolding events in Conways latest novel titled Magpie Murders. You get to play detective for more than a single case here with impressively interwoven storytelling seamlessly connecting the parallel and increasingly intersecting timelines. The sixepisode series is grippingly suspenseful and wonderfully witty. Plus part of the action takes place in a 1950s English village that may harbor dark secrets but has the kind of smalltown charm that makes you want to wander its quaint treelined streets. Leslie Katz Derry Girls Derry Girls premiered its third and final season in October so you can now binge watch the entire awardwinning series in a week like I did. On the surface this is a teen sitcom about a group of high school girls in the 1990s living in the small town of Derry North Ireland at the end of The Troubles. Most teen girls in TV shows the fabulous Wednesday Addams aside are portrayed as selfabsorbed silly and clueless only caring about being popular and dating boys. Series creator Lisa McGee drew on her own upbringing to deliver a simple message Yeah. So what The Derry Girls are loyal honest and occasionally wise beyond their years. Theyre also funny as hell with the short episodes less than 30 minutes except for the finale focusing on one ridiculous situation after another. The group attend a Catholic school run by the weary sarcastic and amazing Sister Michael who became one of my favorite characters. This is another one where youre going to need the subtitles on. They are speaking English but I was flummoxed by the accents. Connie Guglielmo The Old Man This has been a good year for shows about spies of a certain age. Over the summer we got season 1 of The Old Man starring the formidable Jeff Bridges with everexcellent John Lithgow as a foil. Bridges plays a 70ish retired CIA agent and man of action haunted by his past and forced back into the game and he proves that hes still got the chops for it. We also meet his younger self in extended flashbacks. Its a tangled tale of course with tendrils winding tighter and tighter through his personal and professional life. It tends toward the somber and gets talky at times like philosophy seminar talky about deception duty identity family but theres plenty of action across the seven episodes too. Jon Skillings Slow Horses Where The Old Man takes us to locations across the US and elsewhere especially Afghanistan Slow Horses largely confines itself to London. It gives us a shabbier set of spies as well in career purgatory because they messed up big time under the donothing leadership of the brilliantly boozy rumpled and acidtongued Gary Oldman. But they stumble their way into a mission start uncovering secrets and show theyre not to be dismissed so lightly after all to the chagrin of the higherups at shiny MI5 headquarters including a crisp Kristin Scott Thomas. Season 2 kicked off at the beginning of December and if you need to catch up on season 1 from earlier this year its a quick and very enjoyable six episodes. Jon Skillings Taskmaster Having just aired its 14th season Taskmaster has been one of my favorite shows for years now and I am still constantly rewatching all the episodes on a repetitive cycle because of how much it makes me laugh. The multiawardwinning show sees a panel of five comedians from the British comedy scene take part in a variety of bizarre tasks Eat the most watermelon and Impress this mayor to name but two that are then scored and hilariously critiqued by host Greg Davies assisted by series creator Alex Horne. Unlike most panel shows Taskmaster sees the same set of contestants take part in all 10 episodes throughout each series. It not only helps you feel truly invested in the journey toward the final but it really lets you get to know all of the cast along the way finding out you love some comics previously unknown to you for me Fern Brady Chris Ramsey or Sarah Kendall or getting a deeper appreciation of the bizarre minds of those you already loved Bob Mortimer Rhod Gilbert Sally Philips. While its certainly silly and sometimes puerile in its nature its also extremely goodnatured always encouraging you to laugh with the team at both their successes and frequent embarrassing failures. Its why Ive found the show to be such a good form of escapism that never fails to lift my mood and make me cry with laughter. Because how can you not laugh at a man trying so hard to fart on cue that he dislodges a hemorrhoid on TV For a bonus check out the companion podcast hosted by Series 9 winner and superb comedian Ed Gamble that analyzes each episode with a previous contestant or related special guest. Like the show its laughoutloud funny and an instant mood lifter. Andrew Lanxon Spy X Family An anime about a slick ruthless spy a violent assassin and a little girl with psychic powers make for the most surprising and heartwarming show Ive seen in a long time. The show which has the three main characters set up a fake family for infiltration purposes takes a playful look at the double lives they live and how despite it all theyre able to build a warm and supportive family unit out of the facade. Spy X Family blends and twists multiple genres family comedy action mystery in ways that shouldnt work but absolutely does. This is the perfect gateway show for anyone intimidated by anime there are no overthetop energy blasts giant robots or other tropes of the medium. The show is available to stream on Hulu and Crunchyroll. Roger Cheng Heartstoppper Heartstopper is the LGBT show I wish existed when I was a teenager and thats an opinion Im positive many other gay adults share. Its super sweet PGrated take on a gay love story leans into optimism while including plenty of thematic flourishes that harken back to the original web comic by Alice Oseman. I love that this isnt a comingout story for main protagonist Charlie Joe Locke but one about how he develops a friendship with his classroom crush Nick Kit Connor that evolves into something more over the course of the season. Their relationship and other relationships that develop in their wider circle of friends is treated as something they are discovering and navigating. Even more encouraging for young audiences nearly every adult character introduced in the first season whether parent or teacher displays compassion and support for the main cast. Major bonus points to the soundtrack whose playlist of bouncy punk rock and pop has completely taken over my Apple Music Replay list for 2022. While there are now many LGBT movies and TV shows getting a wide release on streaming services like Netflix and in cinema Im simply obsessed with all the happy beats Heartstopper hits. Mike Sorrentino Star Trek Lower Decks This one was a surprise for me. Im not a Star Trek fan by any means I saw the Chris Pine version when I was younger and liked it but it didnt spark anything. But let me tell you Lower Decks actually got me curious about the Star Trek universe. Its approachable has an incredible cast and delivers a hilarious take on Star Trek. The stories take very familiar Star Trekspace exploration situations and show them from the perspective of the cadets from the lower parts of Star Trek ships. The series shows the grunt work the bureaucracy and rivalries and Im laughing every episode not just because the writing is great but because the show makes fun of the Star Trek universe in such a way that even someone who knows next to nothing about that world can appreciate it. Alexandra Able Fleishman Is in Trouble These days theres no better television genre than the baitandswitch. Since every story has supposedly already been told shows like Hulus Fleishman Is In Trouble based on the popular novel of the same name have turned the tables and defied audience expectations in the most satisfying of ways. The titular Fleishman is either a divorced NYC liver doctor navigating his newfound dating success on the apps or his exwife who has gone missing. It all comes together under the judgmental eye and sardonic narration of Tobys friend Libby who ends up being much more integral than she seems. Karisa Langlo The Offer Fifty years after The Godfathers release the movie and the mystique surrounding it still captivate audiences. The Offer presents a dramatized behindthescenes look at the battle to get the movie made. Based on producer Albert S. Ruddys experience making the movie The Offer is a 10part limited series on Paramount Plus that often weaves much of the movies plot into the TV series. Not coincidentally Paramount is also the studio that made the 1972 hit movie. Its also the studio that almost didnt make the movie we all know. Ruddy a former computer programmer at the Rand Corporation is handed The Godfather by legendary film producer Robert Evans brought back to life spot on by Matthew Goode who sometimes puts the screws to Ruddy and director Francis Ford Coppola over casting choices. Marlon Brando was a financial wild card and Al Pacino was too short for Evans tastes. Then theres the Mob. They make it clear in no uncertain terms they dont want the movie made until Coppola agrees to make changes to the final script. Besides to Coppola the artist its not a mob movie but a metaphor for American capitalism. Its also worth tuning in to see what transpires with Frank Sinatra and the infamous horse head.

20,Last Year Was Ridiculously Good for TV. These Are the Best Shows - CNET,Our favourite shows of 2022.,https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/last-year-was-ridiculously-good-for-tv-these-are-the-best-shows/,2022 was an amazing year for television. I probably said that last year and maybe even the year before but facts are facts. Television has never been better. This year however was especially compelling for its variety. Bigbudget shows like House of the Dragon delivered but we also got compelling scifi with The Peripheral genius comedies like Bad Sisters and subversive anime like Spy X Family. Even the downinthedoldrums Star Wars franchise got itself a genuine masterpiece in Andor. So without further ado and in no particular order here are the CNET crews favorite shows of 2022. Read more CNETs favorite movies of 2022 Andor Ive fantasized about living in the Star Wars universe for decades who hasnt and Andor reveals what itd actually be like. In this show youll forget that this is a galaxy run by a space wizard that shoots lightning from his fingers. Instead youll be focused on the grinding reality of life under an oppressive regimes boot the danger of trying to climb its corporate ladder and the power of collective action in facing overwhelming odds. Getting to follow Diego Luna on the path to becoming his morally gray Rogue One hero is a treat but Andors real joys are the unseen tales of rebels Imperials and one unnervingly obsessed space cop. Andor is the best Star Wars story since The Empire Strikes Back. Sean Keane House of the Dragon House of the Dragon was the most pleasant TV surprise of 2022. Yes the show has pacing issues and some episodes were way too dark. But think back to the beginning of the year when House of the Dragon was a mystery. Considering the foul taste Game of Thrones eighth season left in many mouths there was an undeniable inclination to think House of the Dragon would inherit the worst attributes from its predecessor and few of its strengths. House of the Dragon is different enough from Game of Thrones to stand on its own but similar enough to remind you of why you loved Game of Thrones in the first place. Thats a big win. Dan Van Boom Cyberpunk Edgerunners Some shows just have no right being good. Cyberpunk Edgerunners an anime based on an ambitious buggy video game the internet dunked on for months shouldnt be one of the best TV shows of 2022 but it is. Easily. The end result of a collab between game developer CD Projekt Red and Studio Trigger Cyberpunk Edgerunners is a neondrenched exercise in pure hyperstyle. Its as good as any anime Ive watched in the last decade. A compact welltold story about the consequences of poverty and the pursuit of pure capital at all costs. I suspect Ill be watching and rewatching this masterpiece for years to come. Mark Serrels Bad Sisters This superb Irish black comedy comes from the pen of prolific sitcom writer Sharon Horgan Pulling Catastrophe Motherland. Four sisters plot to kill their brotherinlaw JeanPaul after he mistreats each of them including his wife Grace. JeanPaul is possibly one of the greatest villains on TV his pet name for Grace Mammy will haunt your days long after you down this insane cocktail of murder mystery comedy thriller. An absolute gem. Jen Bisset The White Lotus season 2 HBO closed out the year with seven weeks of sweet sweet schadenfreude making me long for the proverbial water cooler so I could dissect each The White Lotus characters likelihood of dying. This seasons richpeople playground a resort in Sicily with requisite crashing waves on craggy shores crumbling palazzi and influential local families. Throw in a couple of enterprising sex workers some spouseswapping and drug induced foibles and you got yourself some appointment television. Not only did the sophomore season of The White Lotus bring the denizens of Twitter together in delicious shared suspense it was also just an extremely well made entry into the prestige TV canon with oniony layers of subtext and an embarrassment of Emmyworthy performances. Karisa Langlo The Bear Ive never worked in the food industry and The Bear showed I made the right decision. This frantic HuluDisney Plus sliceoflife drama played like an extended panic attack yet managed to also be funny and ultimately heartwarming. Anchored by winning performances from Ayo Edebiri an incendiary Ebon MossBachrach and Jeremy Allen Whites tight white Tshirt The Bear irresistibly cooked up a portrait of a work family you couldnt help rooting for. Yes chef Richard Trenholm Severance In the heart of an Omicron winter that removed me from family and friends yet again as I wrestled with feelings of living a remote work life and coming back to an office that felt alien to me Severance arrived like a psychological tuning fork to resonate with everything I needed. Apple TV Plus breakout critical hit show got me from the first trailers its bleak absurd retro style which reminded me of everything from Netflixs Maniac to Charlie Kaufman movies like Being John Malkovich. The idea of workers finding their home and work lives severed from each other didnt floor me I have a high ceiling for weirdness. But the tone the relentless commitment to the unfolding mystery is unforgettably hypnotic. I played the video game The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe shortly after and found it spoke to similar obsessions a sense of time vanishing life repeating mental anguish and fighting repression and depression. Also Severance is fun. The cast is stellar and I could watch them all forever. Its slyly funny far more than I thought it would be. The ending of season 1 let me down only because I was ready for this to go so much further. I guess thats what season 2 is for. Scott Stein The Peripheral Some science fiction shows disappoint me. As a lifelong William Gibson fan whos read all his work I expected The Peripheral an adaption of Gibsons 2015 book thats part of a threevolume trilogy to let me down. It didnt. The Prime Video series is everything I could want disorienting storylines strange near and fartherfuture settings and plenty of big ideas robotic telepresence technological time travel made this mustview TV for me. The idea of people jumping into other bodies using VRlike telepresence devices is something Ive obsessed over since Avatar and still feels ahead of its time. But The Peripheral gets a lot odder than that. My wife got hooked too which is no easy feat. We dont always agree on shows but The Peripheral works as a reflection on our cracked broken current world fears of disasters yet to come and also serves as a good tangled scifi actionthriller. I was truly sad to be left on a Season One cliffhanger but Season Two already promises to be very interesting. If you want more just go read Gibsons two books that are already available. Scott Stein Abbott Elementary All hail Quinta Brunson creator star and Emmywinning writer of this hit comedy. Set at a Philadelphia public school thats predominantly Black the mockumentary series follows a handful of teachers and their social media influencer of a principal Janelle James who are just trying to do the best for their kids with the very limited resources they have. Sheryl Lee Ralph who plays veteran teacher Barbara also won an Emmy this year. And if theres an award for best acceptance speech ever give her that one too. Abbott Elementary is that rare show thats hilarious and heartwarming. Just try to keep up with all the pop culture references. Plus Gritty guest stars. Enough said. Anne Dujmovic The Last Movie Stars In the 80s Paul Newman embarked on a memoir project. Friend and screenwriter Stewart Stern conducted interviews with the actor and those closest to him including wife Joanne Woodward directors famous friends and even his exwife. Newman later abandoned the project and burned the audiotapes but thousands of pages of transcripts survived. This sixpart documentary series about legendary actors Newman and Woodward uses those transcripts to take a loving yet unvarnished look at the couple their public and private lives and their 50year marriage. Actor Ethan Hawke who directed the series brilliantly weaves film clips together with voiceovers from the likes of George Clooney reciting Newmans words and Laura Linney reading as Woodward among other wellknown actors. Hawke also includes excerpts of his Zoom interviews with the actors he recruited as well as the children of the iconic Hollywood couple while he was putting the series together. The words compelling and Zoom meetings arent words youd expect to see in the same sentence. But these meetings are just that giving viewers a window into Hawkes creative process as he wrestles with how to tackle a project of this magnitude and during a pandemic too. Anne Dujmovic Barry When I first started watching Barry I thought the goal of executive producers Bill Hader and Alec Berg was to create a wacky comedy about a hitman trying to become an actor. Now Im convinced Barry is one of the best shows on television. During the shows run The Ringer had a weekly recap with Hader on The Prestige TV Podcast. You could listen Hader breaking down complex shots and deep subject matter almost nonchalantly. He broke down his inspiration for certain elements of the story discussing how writers on the show would solve plot puzzles while making sure the show was still funny throughout. Watching season 3 had me saying to myself time and time again that this show shouldnt be this good but it is. Oscar Gonzales SAS Rogue Heroes I was laid up sick a couple of weeks ago so a show about World War II commandos from the guy who wrote Peaky Blinders was a perfectly timed guilty pleasure. Rogue Heroes took the rousing heroics of Saturday afternoon classics like The Great Escape and The Guns of Navarone and mashed it up with the anarchic energy of Inglourious Basterds plus ACDC on the soundtrack. I smashed the whole series in a day. Yes I am a middleaged dad why do you ask Richard Trenholm Extraordinary Attorney Woo Magical. That may sound ridiculous but thats what comes to mind when I think about this South Korean legal dramacomedy series. When you enter the world of Woo Youngwoo you enter a world where a charming quirky young woman who has autism spectrum disorder is forced to challenge people and societys idea of normal every single day. The magic comes from watching Woo Youngwoo be herself she makes mistakes she misses social cues she answers questions literally she follows routines that comfort her but annoy others. She also wins case after case because shes a brilliant and original thinker with a strong sense of justice who cares deeply about people a counter to a persistent stereotype that individuals with ASD are emotionally disconnected. Theres also magic in watching her family friends and colleagues slowly overcome their prejudices and to the series creators credit become characters as fully fleshed out as our heroine. At a time when it seems the bad guys win more than they should watching Woo Youngwoo win legal battles and friends just makes you feel good. The 16episode season 1 with a soundtrack that reminds me of the music from Pixars WallE was one of the most popular international series on Netflix in 2022. Watch it with the subtitles on. You want to hear from these characters in their own voices. Connie Guglielmo Wednesday If after the Addams Family movies and 60s TV series you felt Wednesday deserved a show of her own youre not being kooky or mysterious or spooky. Directed by Tim Burton the eightpart Netflix teen melodrama series follows the nihilistic Wednesdays adventures as shes expelled from one school her eighth in five years and moves on to Nevermore Academy her parents alma mater. While the school is filled with outcasts and monsters of all varieties Wednesday a role Jenna Ortega kills still manages to stand out with her pale skin and black uniform. Shes allergic to color explains her mother Morticia played by Catherine ZetaJones. Wednesdays flat appearance and clear and witty disdain for her peers will keep you in stitches but theres a mystery to solve something is killing off students and townsfolk in the small town of nearby Jericho. The whole family plays supporting roles including Thing the disembodied hand that can now roam freely as Wednesdays sidekick sleuth. Christina Ricci who played Wednesday in the Addams Family movies of the 1990s returns to the story as Marylin Thornhill the schools only normie or nonmagical teacher who serves as Wednesdays dorm mother and sometime mentor. Steven Musil Better Call Saul This Breaking Bad spinoff took a onenote side character drug cartel lawyer Saul Goodman through six seasons of increasingly criminal mayhem to create one of the most multifaceted TV characters of the decade. In his last season Saul aka James McGill aka Slippin Jimmy aka Viktor St. Claire aka Gene Takavic finally met up with Walter White and Jesse said farewell to Kim Wexler Mike Ehrmentraut and Howard Hamlin and received his ultimate judgment in a series finale that hit all the perfect notes. Better Call Sauls final season delivered twists suspense and a well executed resolution that dipped expertly back and forth between multiple timelines before during and after Breaking Bad. An understated turn by comedy legend Carol Burnett as an elderly mark who brings about Sauls downfall was one of several deft guest performances this season. A love story disguised as a crime thriller Better Call Saul was all about Jimmy and Kim in the end and the shows inevitable heartbreaking conclusion put a fitting bow on their absolute disaster of a relationship. Peter Butler Magpie Murders If youre looking for a whodunit done right try this delightful timetraveling murder mystery based on Anthony Horowitzs 2016 bestselling book of the same name. Its storywithinastory format investigates the suspicious death of successful mystery writer Alan Conway while simultaneously unfolding events in Conways latest novel titled Magpie Murders. You get to play detective for more than a single case here with impressively interwoven storytelling seamlessly connecting the parallel and increasingly intersecting timelines. The sixepisode series is grippingly suspenseful and wonderfully witty. Plus part of the action takes place in a 1950s English village that may harbor dark secrets but has the kind of smalltown charm that makes you want to wander its quaint treelined streets. Leslie Katz Derry Girls Derry Girls premiered its third and final season in October so you can now binge watch the entire awardwinning series in a week like I did. On the surface this is a teen sitcom about a group of high school girls in the 1990s living in the small town of Derry North Ireland at the end of The Troubles. Most teen girls in TV shows the fabulous Wednesday Addams aside are portrayed as selfabsorbed silly and clueless only caring about being popular and dating boys. Series creator Lisa McGee drew on her own upbringing to deliver a simple message Yeah. So what The Derry Girls are loyal honest and occasionally wise beyond their years. Theyre also funny as hell with the short episodes less than 30 minutes except for the finale focusing on one ridiculous situation after another. The group attend a Catholic school run by the weary sarcastic and amazing Sister Michael who became one of my favorite characters. This is another one where youre going to need the subtitles on. They are speaking English but I was flummoxed by the accents. Connie Guglielmo The Old Man This has been a good year for shows about spies of a certain age. Over the summer we got season 1 of The Old Man starring the formidable Jeff Bridges with everexcellent John Lithgow as a foil. Bridges plays a 70ish retired CIA agent and man of action haunted by his past and forced back into the game and he proves that hes still got the chops for it. We also meet his younger self in extended flashbacks. Its a tangled tale of course with tendrils winding tighter and tighter through his personal and professional life. It tends toward the somber and gets talky at times like philosophy seminar talky about deception duty identity family but theres plenty of action across the seven episodes too. Jon Skillings Slow Horses Where The Old Man takes us to locations across the US and elsewhere especially Afghanistan Slow Horses largely confines itself to London. It gives us a shabbier set of spies as well in career purgatory because they messed up big time under the donothing leadership of the brilliantly boozy rumpled and acidtongued Gary Oldman. But they stumble their way into a mission start uncovering secrets and show theyre not to be dismissed so lightly after all to the chagrin of the higherups at shiny MI5 headquarters including a crisp Kristin Scott Thomas. Season 2 kicked off at the beginning of December and if you need to catch up on season 1 from earlier this year its a quick and very enjoyable six episodes. Jon Skillings Taskmaster Having just aired its 14th season Taskmaster has been one of my favorite shows for years now and I am still constantly rewatching all the episodes on a repetitive cycle because of how much it makes me laugh. The multiawardwinning show sees a panel of five comedians from the British comedy scene take part in a variety of bizarre tasks Eat the most watermelon and Impress this mayor to name but two that are then scored and hilariously critiqued by host Greg Davies assisted by series creator Alex Horne. Unlike most panel shows Taskmaster sees the same set of contestants take part in all 10 episodes throughout each series. It not only helps you feel truly invested in the journey toward the final but it really lets you get to know all of the cast along the way finding out you love some comics previously unknown to you for me Fern Brady Chris Ramsey or Sarah Kendall or getting a deeper appreciation of the bizarre minds of those you already loved Bob Mortimer Rhod Gilbert Sally Philips. While its certainly silly and sometimes puerile in its nature its also extremely goodnatured always encouraging you to laugh with the team at both their successes and frequent embarrassing failures. Its why Ive found the show to be such a good form of escapism that never fails to lift my mood and make me cry with laughter. Because how can you not laugh at a man trying so hard to fart on cue that he dislodges a hemorrhoid on TV For a bonus check out the companion podcast hosted by Series 9 winner and superb comedian Ed Gamble that analyzes each episode with a previous contestant or related special guest. Like the show its laughoutloud funny and an instant mood lifter. Andrew Lanxon Spy X Family An anime about a slick ruthless spy a violent assassin and a little girl with psychic powers make for the most surprising and heartwarming show Ive seen in a long time. The show which has the three main characters set up a fake family for infiltration purposes takes a playful look at the double lives they live and how despite it all theyre able to build a warm and supportive family unit out of the facade. Spy X Family blends and twists multiple genres family comedy action mystery in ways that shouldnt work but absolutely does. This is the perfect gateway show for anyone intimidated by anime there are no overthetop energy blasts giant robots or other tropes of the medium. The show is available to stream on Hulu and Crunchyroll. Roger Cheng Heartstoppper Heartstopper is the LGBT show I wish existed when I was a teenager and thats an opinion Im positive many other gay adults share. Its super sweet PGrated take on a gay love story leans into optimism while including plenty of thematic flourishes that harken back to the original web comic by Alice Oseman. I love that this isnt a comingout story for main protagonist Charlie Joe Locke but one about how he develops a friendship with his classroom crush Nick Kit Connor that evolves into something more over the course of the season. Their relationship and other relationships that develop in their wider circle of friends is treated as something they are discovering and navigating. Even more encouraging for young audiences nearly every adult character introduced in the first season whether parent or teacher displays compassion and support for the main cast. Major bonus points to the soundtrack whose playlist of bouncy punk rock and pop has completely taken over my Apple Music Replay list for 2022. While there are now many LGBT movies and TV shows getting a wide release on streaming services like Netflix and in cinema Im simply obsessed with all the happy beats Heartstopper hits. Mike Sorrentino Star Trek Lower Decks This one was a surprise for me. Im not a Star Trek fan by any means I saw the Chris Pine version when I was younger and liked it but it didnt spark anything. But let me tell you Lower Decks actually got me curious about the Star Trek universe. Its approachable has an incredible cast and delivers a hilarious take on Star Trek. The stories take very familiar Star Trekspace exploration situations and show them from the perspective of the cadets from the lower parts of Star Trek ships. The series shows the grunt work the bureaucracy and rivalries and Im laughing every episode not just because the writing is great but because the show makes fun of the Star Trek universe in such a way that even someone who knows next to nothing about that world can appreciate it. Alexandra Able Fleishman Is in Trouble These days theres no better television genre than the baitandswitch. Since every story has supposedly already been told shows like Hulus Fleishman Is In Trouble based on the popular novel of the same name have turned the tables and defied audience expectations in the most satisfying of ways. The titular Fleishman is either a divorced NYC liver doctor navigating his newfound dating success on the apps or his exwife who has gone missing. It all comes together under the judgmental eye and sardonic narration of Tobys friend Libby who ends up being much more integral than she seems.

It looks like the gangs all here in NieRAutomata Ver1. 1a 2B the android with the Gothic Lolita fashion sense and a freaking big sword 9S her android wingman who looks like a post schoolboy in a gothic uniform likable robot Pascal Commander the android commanding officer in charge of the mission Adam and Eve the biblical androgynous androids and Lily the mysterious android fighter who didnt appear in the game but the stage play written by creator Yoko Taro.

Watching NieRAutomata Ver1. 1a will almost be less frustrating than playing the game since you wont have to die again and again in boss fights before you can move to the next chapter.

Vash the Stampede our hero is a sweetnatured pacifist gunslinger wandering a desert colony called No Mans Land with a massive bounty on his head for mass destruction and murder. Trigun Stampede starts at a different point In the story with rookie reporter Meryl Stryfe and her drunken cynical coworker Roberto de Niro chasing the story of Vash to find the truth about him. Instead of the evil mass murderer they find an amiable goofball beloved by local townspeople but relentlessly pursued by the fascistic cops of the conglomerate that rules over the colony. Theres something bigger at play of course. The first episode opens with the reveal of Vash in childhood surviving the destruction of the L5 space colony he grew up on brought about by his evil brother Knives who will be the Big Bad of the story plotting something big and apocalyptic for No Mans Land. Trigun Stampede is an anime updated for 2023 with slicker CGI artwork thats smoother than the handdrawn wackiness that showed the artists personalities. This updated reboot retains the goofy character comedy of the manga and 90s anime and compensates for the new slickness with elaborate camerawork and even more ambitious action set pieces than ever done in a single take with a roving camera that can only be achieved through CG. The first episode is a slow burn with Meryl and Roberto discovering Vashs gunslinger skills and misunderstood true good guy self. Vash the Stampede is a classic good guy who wanders into town and saves everyone before hightailing it out of there before anyone can thank him. He shoulders the burden of being the bad guy so nobody else has to. Once again the series starts out comedic and will gradually get serious as it goes along when Vashs origins are revealed. The revival of Trigun suggests the anime field is opening up its range of genres again after the flood of high school stories during most of the 2000s. Trigun Stampede is a reboot for a new generation of anime fans who didnt grow up with everyones favourite pacifist cyberpunk gunslinger who does the right thing out of duty. Trigun Stampede begins streaming on Crunchyroll on January 7th.

Theyve been best friends since childhood and hes always treated her as a boy. Shes always been a tomboy but now her feelings and his brobehaviour and lack of personal space and boundaries with her are starting to make everything awkward. Hilarity ensues. For many episodes to come. The first two episodes of TomoChan is a Girl waste no time establishing Tomo and Jun and introducing the supporting characters who will be their foils through the series. Theres Tomos best friend Mizuno. Theres Misaki the captain of the school who admires Tomos invincible fighting ability. Oh yeah Tomo is a godtier karate fighter trained by her father at his dojo since infancy. Thats why shes a massive tomboy. The Tomboy Trope Tomo is a male fantasy figure the tough tomboy who knows nothing about being feminine and the series is about her learning. Theres Mifune and Ogawa two gossipy girls who become terrified of her. Theres bubbly British transfer student Carol who is an airhead. The comedy hinges on Tomos emerging romantic feelings for Jun and his cluelessness but even by the end of the second episode it becomes clear that hes in denial about his own burgeoning feelings for his best friend. The Machiavellian Bet Friend Trope If anything Mizuno is the real star of the show a deadpan unsmiling manipulative observer with a Wednesday Addams vibe her lot in life is to torture people for kicks especially her best friend Tomo and his archenemy Jun as she reluctantly plays matchmaker giving advice to Tomo that almost always goes sideways. The Exotic Transfer Student Trope TomoChan is a Girl also has that bizarre anime high school trope the exotic transfer student. Carol is a rich blonde extreme girly girl from England that all the boys crush on and whose air of mystery just because shes foreign makes a foil for the main cast. Carol is a weird airhead who does not act like any British person in real life obviously dreamed up by Japanese creators who have never encountered a real white person in real life. She really acts more like a cross between a robot and a cartoonish Californian airhead stereotype with a hint of Mean Girl than anything resembling British. Anime Teen Romantic Comedies are Weird TomoChan is a Girl is a weird and surreal watch and there are parts of it that you might find problematic but its very revealing of what Japanese men think of romance. To watch teen anime romantic comedies with Western eyes can be a weird experience. For one boundaries and consent issues keep popping up that the Japanese dont seem bothered about. At least TomoChan is a Gir isnt another harem story where the hero is surrounded by a whole band of different girls to pick from and play coy but creepy flirtations with. Its also normal for the heroine in anime teen romances to punch the hero a lot which is still considered slapstick comedy and an explosion of frustrated feelings. The West stopped using the trope decades ago because well its at best assault and at worst abuse. We are assured that teenagers in love do not regularly punch each other in the head in Asia in real life. TomoChan is a Girl is now streaming in both Japanese and English language dubs on Crunchyroll.,"
