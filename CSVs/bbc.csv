The situation is just stuck Kyrylo Budanov told the BBC in an interview. It doesnt move. After Ukrainian troops recaptured the southern city of Kherson in November most of the fiercest battles have been around Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region. Elsewhere Russian forces appear to be on the defensive while winter has slowed down the pace of Ukraines ground operations across the 1000km 620mile front line. Mr Budanov said Russia was now completely at a dead end suffering very significant losses and he believed the Kremlin had decided to announce another mobilisation of conscripts. But he added Ukrainian forces still lacked resources to move forward in multiple areas. We cant defeat them in all directions comprehensively. Neither can they he said. Were very much looking forward to new weapons supplies and to the arrival of more advanced weapons. Earlier this month after a series of Russian military setbacks Ukrainian officials warned about the possibility of another ground offensive by Moscows forces from Belarus at the start of 2023. The push they said could include a second attempt to seize the capital Kyiv and involve tens of thousands of reservists being trained in Russia. Mr Budanov however dismissed Russias activities in Belarus including the movement of thousands of troops as attempts to make Ukraine divert troops from the battlefields in the south and east to the north. Recently he said a train loaded with Russian soldiers stopped in a location close to the BelarusUkraine border and returned several hours later with everyone on board. They did it openly during the day so that everyone would see it even if we didnt want to adding that he saw no real imminent threat from the troops in Belarus. As of now I dont see any signs of preparations for an invasion of Kyiv or northern areas from Belarus. The interview in Mr Budanovs dimly lit office in Kyiv took place days after Russian President Vladimir Putin travelled to the Belarusian capital Minsk for the first time in more than three years. His visit raised speculation that he might try to persuade President Alexander Lukashenko a longtime ally to send Belarusian troops to Ukraine. Belarus has been used by Russian forces as a launchpad for attacks but Mr Budanov believes Belarusian society will not support any further involvement in the war and analysts have questioned the level of preparedness of its 48000strong army. Thats why President Lukashenko is taking all steps to prevent a disaster for his country he said. Since retaking Kherson Ukrainian forces have been engaged in brutal fighting with Russian troops around Bakhmut in trench warfare that has been compared to World War One. For Russia capturing the city would disrupt Ukraines supply lines and open a route for an advance towards other Ukrainian strongholds in the east including Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. The offensive Mr Budanov said was being led by the Wagner Group a Russian mercenary army. Its founder Yevgeniy Prigozhin is believed to want to capture the town as a political prize amid rivalries between senior Russian officials. Away from the battlefields Russia has carried out a relentless air campaign since midOctober targeting Ukraines critical infrastructure with missiles and drones leaving millions without electricity heating and water. Mr Budanov said the strikes were likely to continue but suggested Russia would not be able to sustain the level of the attacks because of dwindling missile reserves and the inability of Russian industry to replenish them. Although Iran has provided most of the drones used in Russias attacks the spy chief says it has so far refused to deliver missiles to Russia aware that Western countries are likely to impose measures on Tehran already under crippling sanctions because of its nuclear programme. The war may be deadlocked for now but Mr Budanov is adamant that Ukraine will ultimately retake all the territory now under occupation including Crimea the peninsula that Russia seized in 2014. He envisages Ukraine returning to its 1991 borders when independence was declared with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Additional reporting by Hanna Tsyba and Robbie Wright.,2022-12-29T00:03:51Z
1,FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried agrees to be extradited,"The cryptocurrency exchange boss is expected to travel to the US to face fraud charges, the BBC understands.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64036615,FTX boss Sam BankmanFried arrives in US to face charges Published Sam BankmanFried former boss of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX has arrived by plane in New York from the Bahamas to face fraud charges. The 30yearold was extradited on suspicion of committing one of the biggest financial frauds in US history US authorities have said. Mr BankmanFried who denies the allegations may appear in court later on Thursday morning. Two of his former associates have pleaded guilty to related charges. FTX cofounder Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison former head of cryptocurrency trading firm Alameda Research were both charged with roles in the frauds that contributed to FTXs collapse Damian Williams attorney for the Southern District of New York announced. They are both now cooperating with the Southern District of New York he said in a video as court documents were released. A lawyer for Mr Wang said his client had accepted responsibility for his actions and took seriously his obligations as a cooperating witness. Samuel BankmanFried is now in FBI custody and is on his way back to the United States Mr Williams said. He will be transported directly to the Southern District of New York and he will appear in court before a judge in this district as soon as possible. If you participated in misconduct at FTX or Alameda now is the time to get ahead of it he added. We are moving quickly and our patience is not eternal. Statement of U. S. Attorney Damian Williams on U. S. v. Samuel BankmanFried Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang pic. twitter. comu1y4cs3Koz US Attorney SDNY SDNYnews December 22 2022 Ms Ellison and Mr Wang face separate charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. Last week Mr BankmanFried was also charged with orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors in FTX. The SEC said the man who was formerly nicknamed the King Of Crypto had built a house of cards on a foundation of deception. As alleged Mr. BankmanFried Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang were active participants in a scheme to conceal material information from FTX investors including through the efforts of Mr. BankmanFried and Ms. Ellison to artificially prop up the value of FTT FTXs inhouse token which served as collateral for undisclosed loans that Alameda took out from FTX pursuant to its undisclosed and virtually unlimited line of credit according to Sanjay Wadhwa deputy director of the SECs Division of Enforcement. By surreptitiously siphoning FTXs customer funds onto the books of Alameda defendants hid the very real risks that FTXs investors and customers faced. FTX has filed for bankruptcy leaving many people unable to withdraw funds. According to a court filing FTX owed its 50 largest creditors almost 3. 1bn 2. 5bn. Among the most serious allegations against Mr BankmanFried is that he used billions of dollars of customer funds to prop up Alameda. Last week Mr Williams said Mr BankmanFried was accused one of the largest frauds in US history. The FTX founder was also accused of using tens of millions in illgotten gains for illegal campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans alike Mr Williams said. However Mr BankmanFried has sought to distance himself from accusations of illegal activity and in a BBC News interview before his arrest said I didnt knowingly commit fraud. I dont think I committed fraud. I didnt want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was. Mr BankmanFried has also denied allegations he must have been aware that Alameda was using FTX customer funds. The FTX exchange allowed customers to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are not traditional currencies but are stored online and act more like investment vehicles or securities often with a high degree of volatility. FTX had an estimated 1. 2 million registered users who were using the exchange but many have been left wondering if they will ever get back their cash trapped in FTXs digital wallets. Mr BankmanFried was once viewed as a young version of legendary US investor Warren Buffett and as recently as late October had a net worth estimated at more than 15bn.,2022-12-20T09:00:57Z

3,Lionel Messi & Paris Saint-Germain reach 'agreement in principle' to renew contract - Guillem Balague,"Argentina captain Lionel Messi reaches an ""agreement in principle"" to renew his contract at Paris St-Germain says BBC Sport's Guillem Balague.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64031342,Lionel Messi Paris SaintGermain reach agreement in principle to renew contract Guillem Balague Last updated on. From the section European Football Argentina captain Lionel Messi has reached an agreement in principle to renew his contract at Paris StGermain says BBC Sports Guillem Balague. Messi 35 who led Argentina to World Cup glory in Qatar is out of contract at the French club in June 2023. Earlier this week Barcelona president Joan Laporta said he would love Messi to return to the Spanish club where he spent 21 years. But Balague says Barca have not approached Messi about a return. He will sign a oneyear deal with the option of another year and the agreement has come after four months of talks between PSG director of football Luis Campos and Messis father Jorge. That was followed by a key meeting in Doha with PSG chairman Nasser AlKhelaifi. It is practically all agreed with PSG says European football expert Balague. Barcelona have not approached him or his dad to offer anything. So it is not that Messi does not want to return to Barcelona. He has not been asked the question. Messi is happy with it all and when back from his holidays the agreement will speed up. His life in Paris is balanced happy everybody is enjoying it and he has a real possibility of winning the Champions League again. Plus it will help him be a candidate again for the Ballon dOr. The seventime Ballon dOr winner was named player of the tournament at the World Cup as Argentina won the title for the third time with a penalty shootout victory over France. After leaving Barcelona Messi signed a twoyear contract as a free agent with the option of a third year in 2021. He has made 53 appearances for the Ligue 1 side so far scoring 23 goals in all competitions. The Argentine has now won one World Cup four Champions League titles one Copa America 10 La Liga trophies with Barcelona and a Ligue 1 crown in France with PSG. Considered one of the greatest players of all time he scored a record 672 goals in 778 games for Barcelona the club he joined as a 13yearold. He ended his association with the Catalan club in 2021 when they could no longer afford to honour the new contract they agreed with him because of La Ligas salary limit.,2022-12-24T12:56:07Z

5,The week in audio: Desert Island Discs; Today guest editors; The Dark Is Rising; Terry Hall,"The fleeting return of Kirsty Young, a mixed bag of guest editors, some midwinter magic and fond memories of Terry Hall Desert Island Discs (BBC Radio 4) | BBC SoundsToday’s guest editors (BBC Radio 4) | BBC SoundsThe Dark Is Rising (BBC World Service/BBC Rad…",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/31/desert-island-discs-kirsty-young-review-today-guest-editors-the-dark-is-rising-remembering-terry-hall,Desert Island Discs BBC Radio 4 BBC Sounds Todays guest editors BBC Radio 4 BBC Sounds The Dark Is Rising BBC World ServiceBBC Radio 4 BBC Sounds Mary Ann Hobbs interviews Terry Hall BBC 6 Music BBC Sounds Richard Herrings Leicester Square Theatre Podcast Terry HallTerry Hall on Piccadilly Radio 8 April 1985 Say goodbye to the twixt time between Christmas and New Year it was lovely wasnt it Ideal for moochy listening and there was some nice audio to accompany lowrumbling family rows idly picking at leftovers sitting in a threehour queue to charge your electric car because trains dont exist any more. Desert Island Discs offered us ex Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young interviewed by current Desert Island Discs host Lauren Laverne. Young retired from the best job in radio in 2019 due to chronic pain caused by fibromyalgia and rheumatism. Laverne who suffered from unfavourable comparisons with Young when she first started unfairly in my opinion gave Young a lovely introduction reminding us that her guest did far more in her career than that one excellent gig. She steered Young through other parts of her life I enjoyed her story of reporting on 911 and it was nice to be reminded that underneath that delicious voice and headgirl grace Young is a journalist. As is Laverne who pressed her naturally private guest on what her illness did to her identity and got a revealing response. Both women wear their presenting expertise so lightly we forget its there at all. Another Radio 4 stalwart Todays twixtweek guest editors a tradition that started 19 years ago. This years week started tamely enough with Lord Ian Beefy Botham in charge on Boxing Day. He got his old cricket compadre David Gower to investigate how test match cricket and the oneday versions can best work together. Overall Bothams Today was OK a ragbag covering cricket small charities grouse shooting advances in leukaemia cures. Like passing the time with a golfclub bore. On Thursday the show presented by the head of GCHQ Sir Jeremy Fleming with its emphasis on data was as dry as a cracker without cheese. However Jamie Oliver gave us a great show on Tuesday. A born communicator with a onetrack mind how food and eating can improve lives especially childrens he used his programme to bang his point across taking on several interviews himself. He pulled in big names too including George Osborne and Tony Blair grilling the latter about how Oliver could best work with politicians to achieve his aim of free school meals for every child whose parents are on universal credit. Good stuff. And Wednesdays programme edited by Nazarin ZaghariRatcliffe was a triumph. Like Oliver ZaghariRatcliffe concentrated on one subject freedom and like him shes a natural communicator. As an exprisoner of Irans appalling authorities hostage for six years until her release in March she brought the regimes treatment of its citizens to the fore. Little moments hit hard. A conversation about humour between BritishIranian comedians Omid Djalili and Shaparak Khorsandi led to Khorsandi becoming upset when she talked about how her cousin cant sleep on her back at the moment because of the air pellet injuries shes sustained while protesting. In another section ZaghariRatcliffe cooked a Yotam Ottolenghi recipe she used while imprisoned alongside Ottolenghi himself. He asked her about cooking in prison and her answer was complicated she loved to make meals for her daughter Gabriella when Gabriella visited her in prison but as time passed Gabriella refused to eat her food. ZaghariRatcliffe also talked about going on hunger strike her pragmatism You are risking all you have which is your life more moving than any hysterics. In the last halfhour ZagariRatcliffe talked to Andy Murray a hero of hers. When she was first taken hostage in 2016 she was put in solitary confinement after a few months she was allowed to watch TV. She had two channels on one was a rubbish soap opera and on the other sport. She watched Murray win Wimbledon and it kept her going. Murray an emotional man was overcome and later moved to tears when considering what ZaghariRatcliffe went through. Me too. The whole three hours of her show are worth a listen. More Radio 4 last week gave us a jammedtogether afternoon drama version of the World Services The Dark Is Rising listen to the WS podcast instead. A 1973 folkfantasy book The Dark Is Rising is set around the winter solstice and this was an ambitious adaptation by Robert Macfarlane and Complicits Simon McBurney dripping with highranking drama types from McBurney to Toby Jones. Weirdly the episodic magical story gave a feeling of a video game our young hero 11yearold Will moves between setups in an arbitrary manner. He meets people called the Walker or the Lady who give him significant gifts. One minute hes contemplating an enormous white horse the next hes on it without quite knowing how. The innovation was mostly in the sound design allencompassingly scary at times including a chilling and tinnitustriggering highpitched whine at the very start. A little pompous but fun and anything that includes the myth of the Wild Hunt is OK by me. Just room for a couple of recommendations for Terry Hall fans knocked sideways by his sudden death. Mary Anne Hobbs did a lovely long interview with Hall on 6 Music in 2019 and the channel has put it up again. Theres also an episode of Richard Herrings podcast where Hall talks about some of the darker times in his life and a 1985 show where he took over from Timmy Mallett as a DJ at Manchesters Piccadilly Radio for one night. That last one is a proper time machine both musically and in the way Hall speaks. Enjoy yourself its later than you think etc.,2022-12-31T17:00:23Z

The original graphic published online via the BBCs Ukrainian website showed how the war has impacted the wealth of Ukrainian billionaire businessmen. The BBC logo is visible at the bottom right of the screenshot with the image titled Fortunes of Ukrainian politicians. The graphic then lists a series of Ukrainian political figures including Zelenskiy with claims that their respective wealth dramatically increased between February 2022 when Russia invaded the country to December 2022. Examples of the altered graphic can be viewed here and here. A spokesperson for the BBC told Reuters that the graphic was altered and this version was not published by the outlet.

Mead gives a heartfelt acceptance speech wiping away tears. Im speechless for once she grins. Obviously Im incredibly honoured to win this award. Ill keep saying it its cliche but I wouldnt have done it without them girls over there and the team that have backed me. Yes Ive got this accolade I did my job and I scored a few goals but I wouldnt have done it without them and I certainly wouldnt have done it without my dad my mum and all my family. And Spoty for 2022 is... Beth Mead She was overwhelming favourite for a reason as it turns out. Stokes is runnerup and Muirhead finishes third. The voting for the main award is now over by the way. The winner will be announced imminently. Its been a good night for the Lionesses all told. Can Mead cap it off Sarina Wiegman wins Coach of the Year She coached the Team of the Year so its only right. I feel very humbled and grateful I am a happy person to receive this very prestigious award says Wiegman. But without this incredible team of players and human beings we could never have performed as we did. Also the staff we have an incredible staff. It has been fantastic to work with this team. Lionesses win Team of the Year A good omen for Mead Quite possibly. Just to be here tonight its such an iconic awards ceremony says Jill Scott. I just want to say a massive thank you for everybodys support we really had the support of the nation behind us and without you all we would never have won this award. Lionel Messi handed World Sport Star of the Year Like Bolts Lifetime Achievement Award this one was already decided. Hard to argue with it really. Hes not bad is he that Messi Rob Burrow wins Helen Rollason Award Given for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity the award goes to the rugby league and Leeds Rhinos legend Rob Burrow. Diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2019 he like Weir has done a huge amount to raise awareness of the condition. His friend Kevin Sinfield is also honoured for his outstanding fundraising efforts. Englands wheelchair rugby league team who won the World Cup last month tell Balding about their success and hopes for the growth of the sport. Theres then a commemoration of Doddie Weir the former Scotland rugby union international who died aged 52 in November after suffering from motor neurone disease. Mike Alden wins the Unsung Hero Award Denise Lewis and Jonnie Peacock do the honours this time. The award goes to Mike Alden a stalwart of community football in Bristol.

As a club we pride ourselves on our disability side of sport. I think everybody should be included in everything. Right its time to get voting. Gentlemen this is democracy manifest Finally Mead joins Scott on stage. Its not something that I would have thought possible but the incredible team thats just walked off the stage are the ones that got me through she says when asked how it felt to win the Euros. I wouldnt have played the football that I did during the tournament if it wasnt for them. A highlights reel from Englands triumphant Euro 2022 campaign spins by. The players then join Logan to discuss their win. They just shout Tooney Tooney Tooney about 10 times until I reply says Ella Toone when asked what young Lionesses fans say to her on the street. I think for us thats all we ever wanted. Growing up we didnt have women footballers to look up to as much as we do now. For us we just want to be role models and inspire the next generation of girls. Long may that continue. Some tennis now. There are affectionate tributes to Sue Barker Serena Williams and Roger Federer. The montages are starting to bleed into one another. Focus OK Focus Despite his stomach bug Stokes manages to appear via video link. Pakistan was another progression for our Test team he says. To be able to say that were the only team to whitewash Pakistan as the home nation is seriously incredible. Lineker makes a reference to Bazball which raises a slight grimace. Were trying to get Bazball cancelled Brendon doesnt like that word being used says Stokes. Anyone getting montage fatigue Ah come on a few more wont hurt. Footage of Englands T20 World Cup final win skims past to a soundtrack of uplifting piano music. The team then take to the stage. Ive got huge pride in the whole group purrs Jos Buttler before Sam Curran talks up the importance of his captaincy. The Buttler did it jokes Lineker. The BBC have presumably muted the groans. Theres a brief interlude for a performance by Tom Grennan. Scott then tees up a montage of Englands dramatic defeat to New Zealand in the Womens Rugby World Cup final. Oosh. Usain Bolt gets Lifetime Achievement Award This one was already decided but Bolt is a worthy winner regardless. Hes an inspiration to everybody but that transcends just being a sprinter says Dina AsherSmith the British runner. Simply peerless says Lineker. Bolt isnt in attendance but hes prerecorded a message. I want to thank my family my friends and my fans for everything through the years. Ive worked hard and to get this award means a whole lot. Its time to hear from Wightman. You get to the top and then you have to work even harder than before to stay there he says when asked about his 1500m gold medal at the athletics world championships. Its a big big milestone ticked off in my career. Jessica Gadirova wins Young Spoty Ellie Simmonds the former Paralympic swimmer announces the first winner of the night and its Gadirova Thank you to my support team my coaches British Gymnastics and my friends and family she says. This goes out to you I would not have been able to achieve this without you and you mean the world to me. Gadirova is next out. I gave it my all blocked everything out focused on myself and tried to put the best performance out there for Great Britain one that everyone could remember she tells Logan when asked about her floor gold. Theres a commemoration of Eddie Butler the former Wales rugby union international and legendary broadcaster whose melodic baritone became inherently associated with the Six Nations in particular. He died in September aged 65. Its time for a montage from the beautiful game. The proof is in the pudding and the pudding in this case... is a football. OSullivan is up next. He speaks to Lineker via video link from Dubai where hes on holiday. I love the game I love competing and if you love what you do you cant wait to get out of bed in the morning and do it he says. Theres a pause. By the way how you doing Gary all right Muirhead is first out to speak with the presenters after a montage featuring family members talking up her lifetime dedication to curling. On the back of qualifying for Beijing we did it the hard way but I think as an individual and as a team we learned a ton there before we knew it we were standing on top of that podium with our medals. Along with the main award the Young Sports Personality of the Year Team and Coach of the Year Unsung Hero and Helen Rollason Award are among the other accolades to be handed out this evening. The Young Spoty contenders are Gadirova again Andrea SpendoliniSirieix the diver and Sky Brown the skateboarder. Spoty is officially under way. Sit back relax and enjoy the montages. We have our first bit of correspondence from Adrian Fowell via email. 64 of a YouGov poll dont know who should win. Doesnt that say everything Shrug. Put Adrian down as a b. Stokes to miss ceremony with stomach bug Clare Stokes Ben Stokess wife has posted a photo of him on Instagram wrapped up in a blanket and looking a little under the weather. All ready for spoty here Except stokesy has come home with a stomach bug reads the caption. Any fans of the democratic process reading this blog Well youre in luck because you can vote for the winner during tonights show either online or by phone. Thats how Spoty works in case anyone was in need of a reminder. Theyll announce the details once the programme kicks off at 6. 45pm GMT. In case its of interest tonights presenters are Gary Lineker Clare Balding Gabby Logan and Alex Scott. This is the 69th edition of Spoty which began in 1954. A word for OSullivan the oldest contender at 47. He won his seventh world snooker championship in May beating Judd Trump 1813 to equal Stephen Hendrys modernera record. His first world title came back in 2001 21 years before his latest triumph. It was his 39th ranking title a record and brought up 74 wins at the Crucible also a record. To give her full credit while Mead scored the jointhighest number of goals at Euro 2022 alongside Popp she ended as top scorer at the tournament on account of her five assists. She has also been on fire with Arsenal in the Womens Super League this year though her season has been badly disrupted owing to a serious knee injury. Who answered b then Heres a poll from YouGov which should add some fuel to the fire. Putting aside the 64 of people who dont know who should win Spoty Mead has a narrow lead over Stokes with the British public. Wightman is the most leftfield choice. Preamble Its that time of year again isnt it Where we all argue over the Sports Personality of the Year Award and whether its a a national institution b totally pointless or c somewhere in between. Umm err have you heard of nuance Its obviously c is what a smartypants might say. This blog is for those who think its either a or b a binary choice with no room for nuance whatsoever. Because what is sport all about if not having a massive argument just for the sake of it Among this years Spoty contenders Beth Mead is the overwhelming favourite. Having won Euro 2022 with England scoring a jointhighest six goals at the tournament alongside Germanys Alexandra Popp few would begrudge her the award. Ben Stokes is also in the mix having revitalised the England cricket team alongside Brendon McCullum the Test coach while also helping the whiteball side to win the T20 World Cup under the guidance of Matthew Mott. Jessica Gadirova the gymnast who won floor gold at the world championships Eve Muirhead who led Team GB to curling gold at the Winter Olympics Jake Wightman who won 1500m gold in the world athletics championships and Ronnie OSullivan the snooker legend complete the shortlist. But who will win Lets find out.,2022-12-21T18:21:25Z
8,Girl group Flo win BBC Sound of 2023,"The London trio, who released their debut single Cardboard Box in 2022, beat Fred Again, Nia Archives and Gabriels to the top of the annual poll, which has a good record of predicting breakout successLondon girl group Flo have taken the top spot in the BBC’s …",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/05/girl-group-flo-win-bbc-sound-of-2023,London girl group Flo have taken the top spot in the BBCs annual Sound of poll which seeks to predict the years breakout acts. Flo formed in 2019 after Rene Downer and Stella Quaresma friends from theatre school saw videos of Jorja Douglas singing on Instagram. Their debut single Cardboard Box produced by MNEK was released in 2022 and quickly became a viral sensation. The band followed it up shortly after with debut EP The Lead which was met with critical acclaim. Last month the Guardian named Cardboard Box one of the best songs of the year with Laura Snapes describing the track as No Scrubs for the TikTok era one of the freshest pop launches in recent memory palpably floating on a sigh of relief as Flo kick some bugaboo back to Y2K where he belongs. In a statement Flo described the Sound of win as wild. We feel so connected to our British music roots winning the BBC Sound of and admire the artists who have come before us especially our gal PinkPantheress winning last year the band wrote. Thank you to everyone who voted for us and put girl groups back on the map. To be recognised for our music and people to believe in our vision inspires us to go further this year. Flo also confirmed that they would be appearing on a remix of Hide and Seek a recent single by grime kingpin Stormzy who delivered the news to the band that they had won the poll. Its just been amazing for all of us to watch you guys break out this year and just be the stars that you are he said. The runnerup in the Sound of 2023 poll was London dance producer Fred Again who broke out during the pandemic with his series of Actual Life albums and collaborations with artists such as Headie One FKA Twigs and The xxs Romy.

After all, they are a major broadcasting force, and with the British Empire …",https://hackaday.com/2022/12/22/bbc-world-service-turns-90/,If youve ever owned a shortwave radio youve probably listened at least a little to the BBC World Service. After all they are a major broadcasting force and with the British Empire or the Commonwealth spanning the globe they probably had a transmitter close to your backyard. Recently the BBC had a documentary about their early years of shortwave broadcasting. It is amazing both because it started so simply and when you think how far communications have progressed in just a scant 100 years. Today the BBC World Service broadcasts in over 40 languages distributing content via radio TV satellite and the Internet. Hard to imagine it started with four people who were authorized to spend 10 pounds a week. Early Days The BBC started with radio 2LO broadcasting to London for a few hours each day in 1922. The service spread across the nation and the publication of The Radio Times started in September 1923. Up until 1927 the BBC was the British Broadcasting Company but in 1927 it became a corporation with a royal charter. As you can see broadcasting has changed a little over the years. By 1932 the service built the famous Broadcasting House to become its new center of operations. Shortwave In 1932 it was pretty unusual to have an interest in worldwide broadcasting. But the Russians and the Vatican were using Shortwave to spread their ideology around the globe. The British who at the time ruled 20 of the people on Earth had a vested interest in bringing Britain to the four corners of the Empire. What better way than radio As the director general said dont expect too much in the early days. The programmes with neither be very interesting nor very good. Thats truth in advertising but what did you expect on 10 pounds a week However not long after that King George V addressed the world via radio to deliver a Christmas message. Many of the kings subjects had never heard his voice before and you can imagine this could help create a bond between people and monarch. The video below shows King Edward VIIIs first broadcast in 1936 about four years after King Georges Soon London calling the British Empire became a common thing to hear on the shortwave bands. The documentary explains the difficulty in building huge shortwave broadcasting sites around the world and then feeding programming to them via an underwater cable. Look at how a 700foot radio tower went up in 1934. Arab Service and War It wasnt long after the BBC World Service formed that Hitler and Mussolini began using shortwave to push their ideas too. In response to antiBritish propaganda in Arabic the Home Office asked the BBC to begin transmitting straight news to counter it also in Arabic. It wasnt long before Prime Minister Nevel Chamberlain addressed the Empire about the threat of war via the BBC and the remarks were translated into multiple languages. The World War brought the BBCs international broadcasting to the forefront to keep the Empire informed and court favorable world opinion. It also became the home for broadcasts from occupied countries such as Greece and France. The number of languages the BBC had to handle was staggering. Linguists translators and polyglots were in high demand for the service. Listening to the BBC was a crime in Nazioccupied countries but people did it anyway to get unbiased news and for a sense of hope. Of course you can imagine that secret messages to spies and resistance cells were part of the broadcasts. For example Pierre Holmes hosted a 15minute BBC program called The French Speak to the French. It often passed coded messages to the resistance regarding arms drops missions and even DDay. For example the DDay invasion was signaled with a line from a poem Long violin sobs rock my heart in monotonous languish. Not all the spies were good guys though. The Germans planted a Dutch spy posing as a refugee was picked up at sea. He repeatedly attempted to be allowed to read a message to his family over shortwave but the message was really to his Nazi handlers. The British were too smart for this however. Speaking of spies the BBC also monitored foreign radio broadcasts sort of a precursor to GCHQ. You can see a portion of a newsreel about how the BBC recorded about 500000 words a day during the war. Cold War It wasnt long after the World War that the Empire was transforming into the Commonwealth. But the world was also entering the socalled Cold War. Propaganda was tremendously important to the Cold War and the BBC was one of the major voices of the West. In addition to news the BBC tried to highlight the differences between political ideals and everyday life behind the iron curtain using satire and intellectual programs. The Two Comrades program for example was a comedy about a party official in ridiculous situations. In one episode there is a complaint that the party only received 99 of the vote while in North Korea they had managed 100 support for the party. Another program The Baffled Newspaper Reader would have one actor read text from an East German newspaper and another actor would provide the true and humorous meaning parenthetically. There was also a program entitled Letters without Signature which encouraged listeners to write about their life experiences. Since this often involved negative information the listeners had to use spylike methods to deliver their messages and not refer to things that might allow them to be identified by the secret police. The programs introduction was something like this BBC three dangerous letters. Dangerous for all those who fear the truth and especially dangerous for all those who want to hear the truth and actually hear it at great personal risk. Letters written to the BBC from target countries could be passed to MI6 facilitating messages from agents. Of course inserting certain music or phrases into a broadcast also helped to communicate with spies in the field. Scandal One thing the BBC documentary doesnt cover is the repeated scandals the BBC has faced over its life. Granted most of those didnt directly involve the World Service but some peripherally did. For example the BBC broadcast documentaries about Malaysia created by what amounted to a PR firm for Malaysia and eventually would apologize to its listeners around the world. From the late 1930s until the end of the cold war the BBC had an MI5 agent assigned who could bar subversives and suspected communists from being on the air or creating content. Once this was revealed it generated a great deal of controversy. Jazz music too was banned for a while as a filthy product of modernity. Even Winston Churchill had been refused air time before World War II something he remained angry about for years. One scandal that directly hit the World Service was during the Falklands War. The BBC World Service was accused of broadcasting plans and positions of British military units. On the other hand you cant make it to 90 without attracting some scandal. The BBC as a whole has had some doozies but the World Service has usually avoided the focus of the big ones. Digital Future Like anything 90 years old the BBC has transformed and changed. Today you are as likely to listen to the BBC World Service using the Internet or satellite radio and the BBCs schedule reflects this. Radio broadcasts directed to developed nations are increasingly rare. A few years ago the BBCs director general said that the BBC must prepare for a time when most of its audience never uses traditional broadcast channels. We are certain the BBC World Service will rise to the challenge. Weve looked at how the studios link to the transmitter sites. The BBC has had its share of odd stories over the years.,2022-12-22T15:00:49Z

Read more...,https://gizmodo.com/uranium-found-at-london-heathrow-airport-in-december-1849976147,Police reassured Heathrow Airport passengers on Tuesday that there is no threat at the airport after border patrol discovered small amounts of uranium in metal bars shipped to the UK from Pakistan in late December. The shipment was reportedly sent on a passenger plane and was reportedly intended to reach a UKbased Iranian business. While uranium is a dangerous and harmful chemical in large quantities Scotland Yard said on Tuesday that the amount found in the shipment was extremely small and posed no threat to the public according to The Guardian. The discovery prompted a terrorist investigation which has not resulted in any arrests and is still underway. Border Force staff found the uranium in a package of scrap metal on December 29 which is believed to have originated from Pakistan. Hamish de BrettonGordon the former head of the British armys chemical weapons unit told The Guardian it isnt clear what the uranium was intended for calling it a milliondollar question. He added that the public doesnt need to be concerned saying The system worked. However given that the Uranium was found in kilo bars authorities are questioning if the sender had deliberately tried to conceal the radioactive element. De BrettonGordon told BBC Radio 4 that he could understand why the public is worried given the substance could be used to create nuclear weapons the BBC reported. Uranium can be used for nuclear fuel in power stations and when highly enriched could be used for nuclear weapons but police say they do not believe the uranium is linked to an active terrorist plot. Iran reportedly has two sites in the UK for enriching uranium to 60 according to the International Atomic Energy Agency but the uranium would need to be 90 enriched to be created. Iran has denied it has any plans to develop a bomb The Guardian reported. I want to reassure the public that the amount of contaminated material was extremely small and has been assessed by experts as posing no threat to the public Commander Richard Smith of the Metropolitan Police told the BBC. Although our investigation remains ongoing from our inquiries so far it does not appear to be linked to any direct threat. As the public would expect however we will continue to follow up on all available lines of inquiry to ensure this is definitely the case. He added However it does highlight the excellent capability we and our partners have in place to monitor our ports and borders in order to keep the public safe from any potential threats to their safety and security that might be coming into the UK.,2023-01-11T19:37:00Z

The 48yearold found fame as a member of the boyband Take That before going on to forge a successful solo career after the release of his debut album Life Thru a Lens. Speaking to friend and presenter Scott Mills in celebration of the album which features hit single Angels and was released 25 years ago Williams was told by Mills 49 that he sees similarities between the two performers. Williams replied Absolutely. I see a lot. This is inconsequential but the algorithm on my YouTube threw up a video of Harry Styles talking in between songs and what he was talking about was a bit of nonsense like I talk about just a bit of banter. It was like I see what hes doing. Hes trying to fill a space That stage is massive and its a lonely place. Youd better throw some shapes or youre just going to feel awkward. During the conversation which took place on Robbie Williams My Life Thru a Lens on BBC Radio 2 Williams also discussed his initial departure from Take That and the impact on his relationship with former bandmate Gary Barlow. I think that I was in the middle of a nervous breakdown my first of many Williams said of leaving the band. All the information going into the computer had made the computer overload So it felt like I was in some sort of burning building and I needed to get out. Thats how it felt at the time. Then I was like OK Ill do this tour and then Ill leave. And they actually went Actually if youre going to leave can you go now Williams left the band which at the time consisted of Williams Barlow Howard Donald Mark Owen and Jason Orange in 1995 before temporarily rejoining in 2010. Williams revealed he later made sure there was chart rivalry between himself and Barlow telling Mills Because thats what the 90s was about. This is what was happening in my camp I say my camp I mean my head its like wrestling or boxing. Its your tribe against their tribe and my tribe was me and their tribe was Gary Barlow and I was all up for that kind of conflict because I got some sort of kick from it. Unfortunately Gary didnt feel the same way and he didnt get a kick from it because he was a wellrounded grownup that didnt need that sort of inflammation in his life. I so badly wanted him to respond but like I say hes a wellrounded grownup. Williams said he and Barlow 51 have since repaired their relationship adding Look we are family. Its like blood family for all the good and all the bad and we are intrinsically locked together on this journey on the planet. All of us me Jay Howard Mark and Gaz. I will always be the younger brother and he will always be the older brother. And I did things that Im not proud of and said things Im not proud of as a reaction to things that I hope hes not that proud of either. That being said taking the mickey out of Gary he didnt deserve that.,2022-12-30T00:01:34Z

BBC News in London is no exception and embraced the future in 2013 to the extent of replacing its fleshandblood camera operators with robotic cameras. On the face of it this made sense it was cheaper and newsroom cameras are most likely to record as set range of very similar shots. A decade later theyre to be retired in a victory for humans as the corporation tires of the stream of viral fails leaving presenters scrambling to catch up. A media story might seem slim pickings for Hackaday readers however theres food for thought in there for the technically minded. It seems the cameras had a set of preprogrammed maneuvers which the production teams could select for their different shots and it was too easy for the wrong one to be enabled. Theres also a suggestion that the age of the system might have something to do with it but this is somewhat undermined by their example which weve placed below being from when the cameras were only a year old. Given that a modern TV studio is a tightly controlled space and that detecting the location of the presenter plus whether they are in shot or not should not have been out of reach in 2013 so were left curious as to why they havent taken this route. Perhaps OpenCV to detect a human or simply detecting the audio levels on the microphones before committing to a move could do the job. Either way we welcome the camera operators back even if we never see them though well miss the viral funnies.,2022-12-30T09:00:59Z

The move comes four years after Mr Guaid declared himself president following the reelection of Nicols Maduro in disputed polls. He was recognised by many Western countries including the US but failed to oust the leftwing president. The vote shows how most opposition politicians in Venezuela have lost faith in Mr Guaid. The National Assembly voted 72 to 29 to abolish his interim government. Lawmakers also voted to appoint a commission to govern the countrys foreign assets as they seek a united front ahead of elections scheduled for 2024. Venezuelas longrunning political and humanitarian crisis has seen some seven million people flee the country since 2015. In November Venezuelas government and the opposition signed a preliminary agreement to find a way out of the countrys political crisis. During talks in Mexico the two issued a joint statement requesting that billions of dollars frozen abroad be released to help fund social projects. It followed years of failed attempts to solve a political deadlock. In response the US said that it would allow the American oil company Chevron to resume some activity in Venezuela.,2022-12-31T12:45:01Z

Mr Santos who was elected in New York told the New York Post My sins here are embellishing my resume. Im sorry. He insisted he was not a criminal and said that the controversy would not deter him from serving his twoyear term in Congress. The allegation was first made in a New York Times report last week. At the time a lawyer for Mr Santos hit back at the claims that he misrepresented where he went to college and his alleged employment history describing them as defamatory and a shotgun blast of attacks. He said during his campaign that he had worked at highprofile Wall Street firms Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. But Mr Santos told the New York Post he had never worked directly for either firm admitting it was a poor choice of words. The 34yearold said he actually worked at a company called Link Bridge as a vicepresident where he did business with both of the financial giants. He also admitted that he did not go to college despite previously claiming to have received a degree from New York Citys Baruch College in 2010. I didnt graduate from any institution of higher learning. Im embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my resume he said. I own up to that We do stupid things in life. Mr Santos who was elected to Congress on 8 November to represent part of Long Island and Queens took a seat from the Democrats as the Republicans triumphed overall with a slim majority in the House of Representatives Congresss lower chamber. His Democratic opponent Robert Zimmerman tweeted that Mr Santos had admitted to being a liar and said he must be held accountable by the Department of Justice for his actions. In a separate tweet he also suggested that Mr Santos should resign and run against me in a special election and face the voters with your real past. Mr Santos told the New York Post I campaigned talking about the peoples concerns not my resume... I intend to deliver on the promises I made during the campaign. As things stand he is set to be sworn in on 3 January along with the rest of the incoming class of Congress.,2022-12-27T14:37:25Z

The 69yearold told investigators he had planned to kill nonEuropean foreigners as he embarked on his shooting spree on Friday they say. The suspect was placed in psychiatric care after being questioned by police. He is accused of opening fire at a Kurdish cultural centre killing three people and wounding another three. The man retired train driver named as William M. told police he had become depressed and suicidal after his home was burgled in 2016 the office of the Paris prosecutor said on Sunday. He admitted that since then his hatred of foreigners had become totally pathological the statement added. It said that on Friday he first went to SaintDenis a highimmigration suburb in northern Paris in order to kill nonEuropeans but found few people there. He then travelled to the AhmetKaya Kurdish centre in Pariss 10th district where he carried out the attack. The man resented that community because Kurdish militiamen involved in the Syrian conflict had taken prisoners during their fight against Islamic State instead of killing them the prosecutors say. A nearby restaurant and a hairdresser also came under fire before the man was arrested without a fight. He was detained on suspicion of murder attempted murder and acting with a racist motive. He has a history of weapons offences and it has emerged that he was released on bail days before the assault.

</li><li>Hear Biden's response when asked about classified documents found in …",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64244007,Second batch of classified Biden documents found Published US President Joe Bidens aides have found a fresh batch of classified government records at a second location in a growing political embarrassment for the White House. The first cache was found at a private office in Washington DC that Mr Biden used after his vicepresidency. The matter is under review by the US Department of Justice. Former President Donald Trump is facing a criminal investigation for allegedly mishandling classified files. It was not yet clear on Wednesday when or where the additional tranche of files was found by Biden aides. The original batch of about 10 documents was discovered in November at the Penn Biden Center a think tank near the White House but only came to light this week. Those papers reportedly include US intelligence memos and briefing materials related to Ukraine Iran and the United Kingdom. They relate to his time as vicepresident under President Barack Obama but it is unclear why they turned up in a private office he started using after that. Access to classified documents is limited by law to people with special authorisation and there are rules about how they are kept and stored. All White House records including classified ones are required to be turned over to the US National Archives after an administrations time in office. The White House has not yet commented on the newly discovered batch. However the find has been confirmed by the BBCs US partner CBS and other US media. During her daily press briefing on Wednesday Biden press secretary Karine JeanPierre declined to answer questions about the first cache of files. This is under review by the Department of Justice she said. Im not going to go beyond what the president shared yesterday. She was pressed on why it took two months for the news to be made public and refused to say when Mr Biden had been briefed on it. The discovery happened just days before the midterm congressional elections. Mr Biden said on Tuesday he was surprised when he found out and he was cooperating with the justice departments review. But the discovery of another batch of classified documents in a second location increases the possibility that this story is not one of isolated carelessness on the part of Joe Biden and his team but rather something more systemic. It also increases the chances that this is not the last new revelation of document mishandling. It is an iron rule of presidential scandals that bad news dripping out over an extended period of time is much more politically damaging than onetime revelations however bad they may be. There have now been multiple days of dripping revelations on the documents story and its already distracting from the issues Mr Biden wants to focus such as dropping inflation levels and the Republican efforts to enact abortion restrictions in the House of Representatives. The controversy also comes as the Democratic president faces scrutiny from a new Republican majority in the US House of Representatives. Now that Democrats no longer have oneparty rule in Washington oversight and accountability are coming James Comer the new chairman of the House Oversight Committee said on Wednesday. The committee is launching inquiries into the president and his family including a request for the White House to turn over documents and communications related to the classified files. At the moment the story is an embarrassment for Mr Biden. If it drags on it could have a more corrosive effect on his presidency. The White House has said Mr Bidens lawyers alerted the archives as soon as they recovered the classified materials at the think tank and the agency retrieved them the next morning. Last August FBI agents searched the Florida home of Mr Bidens predecessor and seized more than 10000 files that Mr Trump had not turned over to the National Archives. The justice department had issued a subpoena for the return of the sensitive files before the FBI showed up at MaraLago. More than 300 documents with classified markings including 18 marked top secret were recovered by federal agents from the golf club in Palm Beach. Mr Trump has not given any reason to explain their presence there but has said he had the power as president to declassify them a claim challenged by legal experts.

The ban aims to help ease one of the most unaffordable housing markets in the world. As of this summer the average home price in Canada is C777200 568000 473700 more than 11 times the median household income after taxes. Some have been critical of the ban saying it is unclear what impact it will have on Canadas housing market. NonCanadian residents make up less than 6 of homeowners in Ontario and British Columbia where national statistics indicate home prices are the highest. As of 1 January the ban prohibits people who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents from buying residential properties and imposes a C10000 fine on those who breach it. In late December 11 days before the ban came into effect the Canadian government announced some exemptions to the regulation including for international students who have been in the country for at least five years refugee claimants and people with temporary work permits. In a statement federal housing minister Ahmed Hussen said the ban is meant to discourage buyers from looking at homes as commodities instead of a place to live and grow a family. Through this legislation were taking action to ensure that housing is owned by Canadians for the benefit of everyone who lives in this country Mr Hussen said. While housing prices in Canada dipped slightly in 2022 they remain much higher than a decade ago. Housing prices were up 48 last year compared to 2013 when the average price of a home was C522951. Meanwhile the average household income for Canadians has struggled to keep pace to rising home prices. The latest data indicates the median aftertax household income grew 9. 8 from 2015 to 2020. These numbers set Canadas housing market up as one of the most unaffordable in the world ranking the country higher than New Zealand the US and the UK according to a Statista analysis of housepricetoincome ratios. The average home price in two of Canadas largest cities Toronto and Vancouver has topped the C1m mark often putting them at the list of top 10 most unaffordable cities in the world. New Zealand passed a similar legislation banning foreign homebuyers in 2018 as the country grappled with its own housing affordability crisis. However inflationadjusted home prices have continued to rise since the ban came into effect. Other countries have enacted different measures to curb foreign homeownership including by implementing designated restricted zones where nonresidents are barred from purchasing homes or bringing in specific fees on foreign buyers.,2023-01-03T16:52:53Z

His mission to spend weeks showing his support for a man he affectionately refers to as the Captain former President Jair Bolsonaro. For Odair the trip ended badly. While he claims he did not participate in the riot at Brazils Congress on 8 January he was among the more than 1500 taken into custody by police at nearby Bolsonaro supporters encampments where many had been for weeks in the immediate aftermath. There were old ladies in there crying. They had lost contact with everyone he told the BBC after his release clad in the blue and yellow Brazilian football gear that has become synonymous with Bolsonaro supporters. This is really sad business. Those detained hail from at least 10 Brazilian states and like Odair they made a long journey to Brasilia. Four days before the riot a video inviting people to the Brazilian capital for a party went viral. It promised free buses would take people from different parts of the country with coffee and food laid on. Who or what group was behind this idea and financed it remains something of a mystery one that has gripped the attention of people across the country. Its obvious to everyone they didnt do it themselves Alice Teixeira a Brasilia resident told the BBC at a local filling station. They were from many places. What have authorities said Earlier this week Brazils current President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva said the rioters are possibly victims of manipulation at the hands of stillunknown financiers. So far much of the investigation has focused on a fleet of approximately 40 buses seized by authorities after the riot. Many of these brightlycoloured buses are currently parked in a police lot on the outskirts of the city where they are clearly visible from the highway. At a news conference on Tuesday Justice Minister Flavio Dino said that unnamed business executives rented the buses to transport Bolsonaro supporters to Brasilia from across the nation who had been offered free trips on social media. While Mr Dino offered no names amid the ongoing investigation he described the alleged organisers as being involved in the agriculture industry and the gun lobby in Brazils conservative midwestern and southern states. Others including President Lula have suggested that mining and logging firms may also be involved. Politically these regions are considered bastions of support for Mr Bolsonaro. Paulo Abro a Brazilian law professor and human rights expert said that backers are likely from groups that benefited from a lack of government control under the Bolsonaro government. The financiers of this incident could be groups that harm the environment or who violate human rights in their work he said. These groups would benefit from attacking the institutions of the state. Denials from Bolsonaristas Many hardline supporters of the former President continue to cling to the narrative that the events of 8 January were the work of leftist provocateurs who they say wanted to derail peaceful protests against the Lula government. Among them is Telma Viera a Sao Paolo resident who spent weeks at a camp in the city alongside other Bolsonaro supporters. On Tuesday she was in Brasilia where she was visiting two friends taken into custody following the riot. This was not something done by our patriots she said outside the police facility where the alleged rioters are being held. There were people from the left there before ours. Another Bolsonaro supporter Edson Varela echoed Vieras statement saying that infiltrators started the violence at the riot to give the government another reason for coming after Bolsonaro. As evidence Ms Varela and Ms Viera both pointed to Instagram and social media videos which purport to show known Lula supporters among the crowd. While none of these videos have been substantiated these opinions are being widely shared and gaining traction among large swathes of Brazilians both at home and abroad. Juscelino Colares a USbased Brazilian law professor told the BBC that his numerous Brazilian friends have sent him videos that document Bolsonaristas telling rioters not to burn or destroy public property. Like me they all believe many agent provocateurs from the left took advantage of frustration among some naive rightwing protesters he said. Whats next While Brazilian officials have vowed to identify and punish those responsible they have so far offered little detail on the investigation although Brazilian telecom carriers have been ordered to preserve data that may be related to the riot. Any potential penalties for those who organised the riot remain unclear. Some Brazilians like Mr Abro a former executive secretary of the InterAmerican Commission for Human Rights are now calling for a congressional commission to probe the riot and what led up to it as was the case in the US with the committee that looked into the 6 January 2021 riot. This country really needs to establish an instrument like that that involves the judiciary and other government powers he said. We need to create the conditions to make that possible. Its vital. In the meantime many Brazilians will be anxiously waiting for answers. I believe some will eventually be identified said Geomar Andre Bender a lawyer and author. But some will never leave their mark.,2023-01-11T16:34:59Z

22,US winter storm: Stranded Native Americans burn clothes for warmth,"""We're fighting a losing battle,"" says Oglala Sioux Tribe's president as the reservation is cut off by impassable roads.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64083848,US winter storm Stranded Native Americans burn clothes for warmth Published Native American tribal leaders in South Dakota are appealing for urgent help as snowedin communities run out of vital supplies amid a winter storm. The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation has been buried in more than 30in 76cm of snow but powerful winds have stacked snow drifts 12ft 3. 6m high. Were fighting a losing battle Oglala Sioux Tribe President Frank Star Comes Out told BBC News. South Dakotas governor said she was deploying the National Guard. Anna Halverson who represents the Pass Creek District on the reservation told the Darsha Dodge Rapid City Journal Were in a really extreme emergency down here. We have drifts as high as some houses that stretch 60 70 yards at a time. Ive seen across the reservation some members were burning clothes in their wood stove because they couldnt get access to wood she added. She said one family had run out of infant formula and other supplies and spent four days trapped inside their home before walking eight miles to get help because their baby was starving. Ms Halverson told the BBC the reservation is desperate and would welcome aid from any volunteers in the area. If anyone can come we need anything and everything she said. The Oglala Sioux Tribe president told the BBC his community was cut off by impassable roads and was running out of food fuel and medicine. The supply trucks cant get out to a lot of residents because of snow drifts said Frank Star Comes Out. Sometimes when they do they get stuck. And they have to be pulled out When we clear a road the next day it just fills back in with blizzard conditions and blowing snow. He said machinery is failing as diesel fuel turns to gel in the freezing cold. Some rescuers have been using horses and sleds or just walking. He said it was unclear how many of the tribes 46000 members were stranded across the reservations three million acres an area roughly the size of the state of Connecticut. South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem has mobilised the states National Guard to haul firewood from a nearby national forest to the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. The troops will also help dig out tribal members trapped in the snow which began dumping on the region a fortnight ago. Wayne Boyd chief of staff to the Rosebud Sioux president told the Associated Press news agency We have families that are way out there that we havent heard from in two weeks.,2022-12-24T03:13:53Z
23,Iran protests: 'No going back' as unrest hits 100 days,Anger swells despite a fierce crackdown as the regime faces its biggest challenge in decades.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64062900,Iran protests No going back as unrest hits 100 days Published A hundred days after they began the longest running antigovernment protests in Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution have shaken the regime but at a heavy cost to the people. More than 500 protesters including 69 children have been killed according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency HRANA. Two protesters have been executed and at least 26 others face the same fate after what Amnesty International calls sham trials. Although nationwide demonstrations have swept Iran before once in 2017 lasting until early 2018 and another in November 2019 the current protests are unique as they involve people from across society and women are taking a lead role under the slogan Woman Life Freedom. Some Iranian celebrities have taken irrevocable steps to support protests leading to their arrest or exile. Taraneh Alidoosti a wellknown Iranian actress is being held in the notorious Evin prison after she condemned the execution of a young protester. Previously she published a photo of herself without a mandatory headscarf holding a sign with the protesters slogan. I have worked with Taraneh on four films and now she is in prison for her rightful support of her fellow countrymen and her opposition to the unjust sentences being issued Asghar Farhadi who directed Alidoosti in his Oscarwinning film The Salesman wrote on Instagram. If showing such support is a crime then tens of millions of people of this land are criminals Mr Farhadi added. Death threats Another prominent Iranian actress who has left the country Pegah Ahangarani told BBC Persian Both sides have been radicalised the regime in its crackdown and people in film industry in their response. Iran cannot go back to preMahsa Amini era referring to the Kurdish Iranian woman whose death in the custody of Irans morality police on 16 September sparked the protests. Hamid Farrokhnezhad another wellknown Iranian actor moved to the US earlier this month and immediately called Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei a dictator comparing him to Franco Stalin and Mussolini. Ali Karimi one of Irans most celebrated former footballers who was living in Dubai also supported the protests. He said Iranian intelligence agents threatened to kill him eventually leading him to move to the US. Karimi is now one of the most outspoken critics of the Iranian regime on his Instagram account with more than 14 million followers. Another Iranian football icon Ali Daei had his jewellery shop and restaurant shut down by the Iranian judiciary after coming out in support of a nationwide strike. What also marks the current protests out from previous ones is the emerging use by demonstrators of petrol bombs. These have been used against bases of the Basij militia and Hawza or religious schools for Shia Muslim clerics. Turban tossing Irans Generation Z has been at the forefront of these protests defying strict religious rule and setting new trends such as burning headscarves. Another new trend among young protesters is socalled turban tossing sneaking up behind Shia Muslim clerics knocking their turban off and running away. A schoolgirl without a headscarf in Tehran knocks off a clerics turban runs away. TurbanTossing is a campaign to protest against the symbol of access to the ruling system privilege corruption and oppression. MahsaAmini pic. twitter. comrdwrTXQ2Nr Omid Memarian OmidM November 13 2022 A 16yearold boy Arshia Emamgholizadeh was arrested in the northwestern city of Tabriz last month accused of turban tossing. He was held for 10 days before being released. Two days later he committed suicide something his family blames on his treatment in prison. During his detention Arshia had been beaten with batons and given unknown pills a source close to the family told BBC Persian. Iranian authorities have not only cracked down on protesters but have also used the bodies of those who have died in custody or been killed as bargaining chips to silence the families of victims. Fearing such pressure the brother of a killed protester stole his body from a morgue driving around town for hours a source told BBC Persian. Mehran Samak 27 was shot in the head in the northern city of Bandar Anzali for honking his cars horn in celebration of Irans elimination from the World Cup on 29 November. Another family say they found shocking signs of torture on the body of their 23yearold son Hamed Salahshoor who died in custody when they exhumed his body after he was forcibly buried 18 miles 30km away from their home town. Executions and torture So far two men have been executed after being convicted of vaguely defined national security charges linked to the protests in what human rights groups have condemned as gross miscarriages of justice. Many of those on death row have said they were tortured. The Kurdistan Human Rights Network a nongovernmental organisation said a KurdishIranian rapper Saman Yasin who was sentenced to death attempted to kill himself on Tuesday. The rights group has previously said Yasin was tortured while in detention. Irans Supreme Court upheld an appeal against his death sentence on Saturday and ordered him to be retried. In an audio file obtained by BBC Persian a 26yearold amateur bodybuilder Sahand Noormohammadzadeh alleges that he was subjected to several mock executions in prison. Mr Noormohammadzadeh was sentenced to death in November after he was found guilty of enmity against God defined under Iranian law as creating public insecurity with a weapon. He was accused of blocking traffic on a highway by tearing down railings during a protest in Tehran on 23 September which he denied. BBC Persian has also obtained Xray images that show three ribs of an imprisoned radiologist were broken piercing his lung. Dr Hamid GhareHasanlou was found guilty of corruption on Earth a crime which carries death penalty. An informed source told Amnesty International that Dr GhareHasanlou was subjected to torture and illtreatment in order to extract a forced confession.,2022-12-26T00:20:06Z

Let’s keep pushing girls’</li></ul>Beth Mead has been crowned the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2022 after firing England to a history-making …,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/21/england-star-beth-mead-crowned-bbc-sports-personality-of-the-year-2022,Beth Mead has been crowned the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2022 after firing England to a historymaking European Championship that propelled womens football into the mainstream. The 27yearold saw off competition from Ben Stokes and Ronnie OSullivan to win the prize hobbling on to the stage at MediaCity in Salford to collect the award after seriously injuring her knee last month. Mead said she was speechless for once and held back tears as she thanked her mother who is receiving treatment for cancer and received a standing ovation from the sporting stars in the crowd. Mead said I certainly wouldnt have done this without my dad my mum and all my family. Most of all this is for womens sport and for womens sport heading in the right direction. Lets keep pushing girls and doing the right things. Mead had been the overwhelming favourite after her six goals and five assists the best in the tournament helped the Lionesses to a Wembley final where they defeated the eighttimes champions Germany to secure their first major trophy and Englands first since 1966. The prize completed a clean sweep for England women at the 69th Sports Personality of the Year awards. They also won team of the year and coach of the year for Sarina Wiegman the first woman to take the accolade in its 23year history. It is the first time in half a century that the top prize has been won by women in consecutive years following Emma Raducanus triumph in 2021. The last time it happened a 21yearold Princess Anne took the prize for winning eventing gold in 1971 followed a year later by pentathlete Mary Peters. But it is also a bittersweet victory for Mead who ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament playing for Arsenal last month an injury that almost certainly rules her out of next years World Cup and has had to deal with her mothers struggle with cancer. Mead hinted at her personal difficulties in an interview with Alex Scott earlier in the night when asked how her Lioness teammates had helped her overcome the problems watched from the audience by her father and brother. The girls are like a family away from home and when things at home havent been great they supported me so well she said appearing briefly emotional. The striker whose mother briefly tried to encourage her to take up ballet before realising her daughter was a much better footballer later told reporters she would die happy having won Spoty. Asked whether she had any advice for any potential future Lionesses inspired to take up the game this year Mead said she played her best football when I was playing for the love of the sixyearold that started. She added So I would say enjoy every moment and dont forget the reason why you are playing football. The award caps a helterskelter year for the footballer who has spoken candidly about hating being left out of Team GBs 2020 Olympics squad and much more painfully about her mothers ongoing treatment for cancer. Mead told the Guardian last month that she had spent all year trying to put a smile on my mums face. There is perhaps no more fitting way to end 2022 than with the coveted BBC trophy. Seven of Meads Lioness teammates collected the award for team of the year presented by Gary Lineker Gabby Logan Alex Scott and Clare Balding. Jill Scott fresh from being crowned queen of the jungle in Im a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here said she hoped the teams triumph had inspired plenty of girls to ask for football boots this Christmas and it will be classed as normal as she accepted their award. Stokes who came runnerup could have laid strong claim to the coveted ward had it not been for Meads golden year. Stokes struck England to T20 World Cup glory and took over as Test captain in April a first year capped with Englands first away test series win in Pakistan in 22 years. Eve Muirhead who won Olympic Gold as womens curling skip at the Beijing winter games came third in the competition which is decided by a live public vote from a shortlist selected by a panel of experts. One of the most emotional moments of the night came when Rob Burrow the former England and Leeds Rhinos rugby league player received a standing ovation while being presented with the Helen Rollason award for his work raising awareness of his condition Motor Neurone Disease. On stage alongside his wife Lindsey Burrow the former scrumhalf said he was totally overcome and had been inspired to keep going by his close friend and exteammate Kevin Sinfield who held back tears as he was given a Special Award for his superhuman fundraising efforts. Sinfield who has raised more than 7m by running seven marathons in seven days in 2020 and 300 miles from Edinburgh to Manchester in a week last month described Burrow as the most inspirational bloke in the UK at this moment in time adding Hes inspired us all to be better friends. There had been some controversy even before the first trophy was handed out when Lineker joined a chorus of criticism about the omission of Matt Fitzpatrick 28 who won golfs prestigious US Open in June. Lineker tweeted two embarrassed emojis at the decision not to include Fitzpatrick on the shortlist while twotime World Golf Club Championship winner Ian Poulter described the awards as a continued farce and joke.,2022-12-21T21:40:59Z
25,Song of a GP: folk musicians tell stories of modern British lives for BBC,21st Century Folk paired songwriters such as Angeline Morrison with five people in north-east EnglandA series of contemporary folk songs and short films were released on Sunday as part of the 21st Century Folk initiative to celebrate the lives and experiences…,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/09/song-of-a-gp-folk-musicians-tell-stories-of-modern-british-lives-for-bbc,A series of contemporary folk songs and short films were released on Sunday as part of the 21st Century Folk initiative to celebrate the lives and experiences of five people across the northeast of England. The programmes launched by BBC Radio 2 in partnership with BBC Local Radio follow the songwriters as they meet the people selected to take part in the project. The songwriters were then tasked with creating folk music from the contributors stories that told relatable tales of life in the northeast which were then performed by local musicians. The people selected to take part ranged from a doctor who administered thousands of Covid vaccines during the pandemic to a foyboatman who helps ships from around the world moor on the Wearside docks. This project is a modern take on the historic BBC Radio Ballads a series of documentaries made in the 1950s and 1960s for the BBC Home Service that weaved the real voices of working communities with traditional folk songs. Andrea Bell who runs a soup kitchen and food bank called the Sunderland Community Soup Kitchen was chosen to share her story. Bell was partnered with singersongwriter Martyn Joseph who composed and performed Alberts Place inspired by Bells life. Singersongwriter Thea Gilmore from Oxfordshire wrote She Speaks in Colours capturing the story of Delyth Raffell from Blyth who tragically lost her teenage daughter Ellen aged just 16 to anaphylaxis. The One Show on BBC One will feature Raffell showing the moment Gilmore performed her song to her for the very first time tonight at 7pm. Katie Toner 28 from Northumberland was also picked to tell her story which was taken up by singer multiinstrumentalist and songwriter Angeline Morrison. Toner runs an inclusive events business where she organises accessible parties and sleepovers for neurodiverse children. She has autism and ADHD and said typical childrens parties were often overwhelming as a child. Toner said she was shocked when she found out she had been selected for the project but felt grateful to be given the opportunity to open up conversations about neurodiversity. When its your life its just your life. Its not until you sit back and talk to people that you realise perhaps its more unique than I realised it was Toner said. Im a really proud ADHD and autism advocate so if I can tell my story and other peoples stories too thats even better. Morrison whose album was named the Guardians best folk album of 2022 said it was a real honour to be approached for the project. Ive done lots of collaborations Ive done commissions lots of toplining but Ive never been asked to write a song about a particular living person before. Its a great honour but theres a lot of weight that comes with that too. I really loved listening to Katie talk about her life. She seems like a proud liver of life and somebody who is taking all the uniqueness of who they are and pouring it into beautiful things for other people. She really is an incredibly generous person. Toners song A Dream for You was performed by the Unthanks. The heart of this project was bringing the community together so for Radio 2 to bring me and Angeline from opposite ends of the country but then me and the Unthanks from literally a 12minute drive away its just brilliant. Other contributors included Michael Dodds a fifthgeneration foyboatman in the port of Sunderland. Dodds met the Squeeze lyricist Chris Difford who was inspired by Dodds stories of his life and work to write Foyboatmen. Difford performs the song with the singer Kathryn Williams Dr Ifti Lone a dedicated GP working in Middlesbrough had his story told by songwriter Sean Cooney. Cooney performed the song Doctor Boro with his bandmates the Younguns. 21st Century Folk is available on BBC Radio 2 across this week and all the songs can be heard now on BBC Sounds.,2023-01-09T06:00:10Z

27,Afghanistan: Tears and protests as Taliban shut universities to women,"As the Taliban shut universities and other education, Afghan women see their future crumble.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64048082,Afghanistan Tears and protests as Taliban shut universities to women Published Its an order that girls and women across Afghanistan had been dreading ever since the Taliban returned. On Wednesday girls in their hijabs turned up to their university campuses to be blocked and turned away by Taliban guards. Footage shows groups weeping as theyre led away. After excluding girls from most secondary schools these past 16 months the Taliban this week also banned university education for women. They have destroyed the only bridge that could connect me with my future one Kabul University student told the BBC. How can I react I believed that I could study and change my future or bring the light to my life but they destroyed it. Authorities issued the order on Tuesday and by the following day other places of learning including Islamic religious schools and private tuition colleges in several provinces were also carrying out the ruling. Sources from three provinces Takhar in the north Ghazni in the southeast and the capital Kabul confirmed to the BBC that the Taliban had stopped girls from attending private education centres there. All avenues of formal education for women are being shut down it appears. It led some women to dare to protest on Wednesday on the streets in Kabul a dangerous act given the Talibans record for detaining protesters. The small demonstrations were quickly shut down by Taliban officials. This generation had thought they were the lucky ones getting the education denied to their mothers older sisters and cousins. Instead theyre seeing their future crumble. The Taliban which began as a hardline Islamist militant group had promised to respect womens rights when they swept back to power in August last year after the horrors of their previous rule from 19962001 when women couldnt work or study. But their latest decree again strips away whatever scant freedoms and rights had been afforded to women after USled forces withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban returned. Yet only three months ago the Taliban had conceded to allowing university entrance exams to go ahead. Thousands of girls and women sat the tests in provinces across the country. Many had studied in secret at home or risking venturing to hidden tutoring colleges set up for girls. The danger was always present. During some of the exams bombers targeted schools killing pupils. But still the young women persisted. Even when the Taliban in November brought in lastminute restrictions on subjects barring girls from courses like economics engineering and journalism they kept trying many applying for teaching and medicine. As another female student put it to the BBC Why should we always be the victim Afghanistan is a poor country. But women in this country have accepted poverty alongside every other problem and they still they have to suffer. Girls schooling has long been a point of contention between conservative and more moderate factions in the Taliban. The university ban now indicates a win by the more fundamentalist in the Taliban whose supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada believes modern education particularly for women and girls is wrong in Islamic teachings. Yet not everyone in the ruling movement thinks like him and there were reports more moderate officials in cities like Kabul had wanted girls over the age of 12 to get an education. As rights advocates have warned the decision has an impact on the whole countrys future. No country can thrive when half of its population is held back US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken warned. Western countries had insisted on womens education as a condition the Taliban would need to meet if they wanted global recognition. However the Taliban have ignored the criticism so far. For Afghan families both in the country and around the world seeing the future for their daughters slide back into the dark ages has ignited fear and anger. News of the university ban prompted some Afghan women activists to post stories of their own university graduation days in cap and gown. The pushback against the Taliban since they seized power again has not been enough they say. And its part of a rising tide of restrictions on womens daily lives in recent weeks. In November women in Kabul were also stopped from entering public places such as parks and gyms. Women are increasingly being confined to their homes in policies tantamount to imprisonment says the UN. Action is not Islamic For one law student her higher education path seems over now. Her university term had ended for the winter break and wasnt due to recommence until March. But now shes not allowed to step foot back onto campus she has lost everything. As a Sharia law scholar she told the BBC she was struggling to make sense of it according to Islamic teachings. The Taliban have taken the rights that Islam and Allah have given to us she told the BBC. They have to go to other Islamic countries and see that their actions are not Islamic. According to what they say this is Sharia. But why do they want to practise it only on women Why dont they apply it to men Other religious scholars back up her point. Nawida Khurasani one of the few female Afghan religious scholars says the decree defies Islamic values. It has no place in Islam because Islam commands both men and women to get an education said Ms Nawida who now lives in Canada. Another religious scholar who the BBC spoke to a male imam living inside Afghanistan agreed that both men and women should be able to be educated under Islam. For many Afghanistan watchers however theres no point in trying to explain the Talibans actions under supposed Islamic teachings. They say the university ban is just a continuation of the movements aims to completely suppress women and erase the freedoms theyd had in the years between periods of Taliban rule. Closing the door on university education is the Taliban completing their control over women. Afghanistan is not a country for women but a cage for women said Afghan academic and activist Humaira Qaderi who lives in the United States. Theres no social life left for Afghan women. The streets are now dominated by men. This was the last thing that the Taliban could do. But they did it.,2022-12-21T11:44:52Z
28,The week in TV: Mayflies; Without Sin; Prince Andrew: The Musical; Marie Antoinette,The BBC’s drama of lost youth and male friendship is a bittersweet triumph; Vicky McClure and Johnny Harris are back with a twist; and contrasting tales of two royalsMayflies (BBC One) | iPlayerWithout Sin (ITVX) | itv.comPrince Andrew: The Musical (Channel 4…,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/01/mayflies-bbc-review-martin-compston-without-sin-vicky-mcclure-prince-andrew-the-musical-marie-antoinette,Mayflies BBC One iPlayer Without Sin ITVX itv. com Prince Andrew The Musical Channel 4 All 4 Marie Antoinette BBC Two iPlayer Watching BBC Ones Mayflies you first wonder if its a male weepie a kind of Beaches for blokes. Adapted by Andrea Gibb Elizabeth Is Missing from the Andrew OHagan novel it wastes no time in reaching for the emotional jugular. From the moment vivid teacher Tully Tony Curran tells his thoughtful writer friend Jimmy Martin Compston that he has terminal cancer everything floods out sadness fear humour anger memory over two beautifully paced profoundly demanding episodes. This is a drama thats not only in touch with its feelings it needs you to be in touch with them too. Packed with disparate themes love class assisted dying Mayflies is also about the knotty bonds forged in youth. We see the pair as teenagers in 1980s Scotland sensitive Jimmy Rian Gordon and charismatic Tully Tom GlynnCarney both troubled but full of grit and hope living for music going with friends to see a postpunk festival in Manchester and spotting their heroes Johnny Marr ya legend. Their mutual devotion is irrefutable but is it the answer now Is it fair spoiler alert that Tully asks Jimmy to help him with the darkest most intense level of assistance Dont let me die like a prick. We all die like pricks. Its left to the women Tullys Anna Ashley Jensen and Jimmys Iona Tracy Ifeachor to pour cold reality over the idea that brotherhood trumps all. If that sounds wretched and soggy the televisual equivalent of a bed bath with a wet wipe its not at all. The rough throwaway humour Are you sure you should be smoking That nag has bolted stops things from collapsing into trite fridgemagnet affirmations or gloopy mawkishness. All the performances are extraordinary particularly from Curran and Jensen as Tully and Anna plummet through hell without a parachute. Mayflies emerges as a fearlessly expressive poem about life death and love at once heartbreaking and uplifting. What a powerful drama to see out the old year. As father and daughter in 2010s This Is England 86 the chemistry between Johnny Harris and Vicky McClure was palpable albeit toxic. Now theyre reunited in ITVs fourpart Nottinghamset thriller Without Sin created and written by Frances Poletti. McClure plays Stella a grieving mother who uses a restorative justice scheme to visit convicted murderer Charles Harris in prison to get answers about how her daughter Maisy died. Cab driver Stella vacant gaze long safety blanket hair is living a halflife hating herself for being awol when her daughter was killed. Even a tryst with her ex Maisys father Paul Perry Fitzgerald seems mechanical less about sex than numbing shared pain. When Stella visits Charles theres an expectation of standard screenmurderer fare coldness evil a taunt or two. However softspoken urgent Charles isnt quite what you expect. Without divulging spoilers he isnt what Stella expects either. Without Sin evolves into her circuitous quest for the truth taking in drugs family dysfunction gangsters human fallibility and imperilled teenagers. Stuck in prison Charles is a shapeshifting study in ambiguity is he a force for good telling the truth or bad toying with Stella The plot becomes too tangled and busy like a dangerously overloaded plug extension but it works hard to avoid being formulaic with a twist creeping up on you like a slowly spreading shadow. I feel guilty for not liking the hourlong Prince Andrew The Musical more. Part of Channel 4s Truth and Dare 40 Years of Punching Boundaries season it deserves credit for cocking a subversive snook at the ultimate Prince Charmless who fraternised with Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein even after Epstein was convicted as a sex offender and allegedly then some.

29,Afghanistan: Taliban bans women from working for NGOs,The latest restriction from Afghanistan's Islamist rulers says women are breaking strict dress codes.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64086682,Afghanistan Taliban ban women from working for NGOs Published An order by the Taliban banning women from working for nongovernmental organisations NGOs has been condemned by the United Nations which said the move violated fundamental rights. The Islamist rulers justified the move by saying female NGO staff had broken dress codes by not wearing hijabs. The decree comes just days after female students were banned from universities. The US Secretary of State also criticised the move saying it would be devastating for the Afghan people. Female Afghan NGO workers acting as the main earners in their household told the BBC of their fear and helplessness. One asked If I cannot go to my job who can support my family Another breadwinner called the news shocking and insisted she had complied with the Talibans strict dress code. A third woman questioned the Talibans Islamic morals saying she would now struggle to pay her bills and feed her children. The world is watching us and doing nothing said another female interviewee. The BBC is not publishing the womens names in order to protect them. Saturdays order came in a letter from the Ministry of Economy to both national and international NGOs. It threatened to cancel the licence of any organisation that did not swiftly comply. By way of explanation it said women were breaking Sharia law by failing to wear the hijab. The move has sparked international outrage with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying he was deeply concerned adding that it will disrupt vital and lifesaving assistance to millions. Women are central to humanitarian operations around the world. This decision could be devastating for the Afghan people Mr Blinken said. It was also described as a clear breach of humanitarian principles by a senior United Nations official. UN agencies have a significant presence in the country carrying out relief and development work. An urgent meeting of the Humanitarian Country Team was planned for Sunday to respond to the news. An employee of Save the Children told BBC News the organisation was planning to meet Taliban authorities saying that if women were not allowed to work then some NGOs would have to close. It is also feared that Afghan women could be left unable to receive aid directly if organisations are only allowed to employ men. Taliban rules prevent men from working with women. Female employees were essential for reaching other women and girls explained Melissa Cornet from Care International. She added Without them the humanitarian situation might deteriorate rapidly in a situation where most of the country is already facing lifethreatening levels of hunger. The South Asian branch of Amnesty International described the ban as yet another deplorable attempt to erase women from the political social and economic spaces of Afghanistan. One doctor working in the northern city of MazariSharif and nearby remote villages said she was sad and devastated at the development. She predicted great difficulty for women trying to access medical treatment as they cant fully tell their problems to men. Meanwhile one imam whose identity is again being protected by the BBC said the Taliban were not committed to any Islamic value. He explained Islam has not said that men can educate and women cannot. Or men can work and women cannot. We are confused about this decision. A ban on women attending Afghan universities earlier this week met similar criticism. It triggered protests including in Herat on Saturday which were rapidly suppressed by the Taliban. Since seizing back control of the country last year the group has steadily restricted womens rights despite promising its rule would be softer than the regime seen in the 1990s. As well as the ban on female university students now being enforced by armed guards secondary schools for girls remain closed in most provinces. Women have also been prevented from entering parks and gyms among other public places. Additional reporting by Haniya Ali,2022-12-24T16:19:54Z

Ukrainian forces fired six rockets from a HIMARS launch system and two of them were shot down a defense ministry statement said. It did not say when the strike happened. The strike using a U. S. supplied precision weapon that has proven critical in enabling Ukrainian forces to hit key targets delivered a new setback for Russia which in recent months has reeled from a Ukrainian counteroffensive. According to the governor of Russias Samara region Dmitry Azarov an unspecified number of residents of the region were among those killed and wounded by the strike on the town of Makiivka. Russian military bloggers whose information has largely been reliable during the war said ammunition stored close to the facility had exploded in the attack and contributed to the high number of casualties. Expressing anger at the losses Daniil Bezsonov an official with the Russianappointed administration in Russianoccupied Donetsk called for the punishment of military officers who ordered a large number of troops to be stationed at the facility. The Ukrainian military appeared to acknowledge the attack Monday with the General Staff confirming that Makiivka was hit on Dec. 31 and saying 10 Russian military vehicles were destroyed or damaged. It added that Russian personnel losses were still being clarified. In a claim that could not be independently verified the Strategic Communications Directorate of Ukraines Armed Forces had maintained Sunday that some 400 mobilized Russian soldiers were killed in a vocational school building in Makiivka and about 300 more were wounded. The Russian statement said the strike occurred in the area of Makiivka and didnt mention the vocational school. Meanwhile Russia deployed multiple exploding drones in another nighttime attack on Ukraine officials said Monday as the Kremlin signaled no letup in its strategy of using bombardments to target the countrys energy infrastructure and wear down Ukrainian resistance to its invasion. The barrage was the latest in a series of relentless yearend attacks including one that killed three civilians on New Years Eve. On Monday Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that 40 drones headed for Kyiv overnight. All of them were destroyed according to air defense forces. Klitschko said 22 drones were destroyed over Kyiv three in the outlying Kyiv region and 15 over neighboring provinces. Energy infrastructure facilities were damaged as the result of the attack and an explosion occurred in one city district the mayor said. It wasnt immediately clear whether that was caused by drones or other munitions. A wounded 19yearold man was hospitalized Klitschko added and emergency power outages were underway in the capital. In the outlying Kyiv region a critical infrastructure object and residential buildings were hit Gov. Oleksiy Kuleba said. Russia has carried out airstrikes on Ukrainian power and water supplies almost weekly since October. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of energy terrorism as the aerial bombardments have left many people without heat amid freezing temperatures. Ukrainian officials say Moscow is weaponizing winter in its effort to demoralize the Ukrainian resistance. Ukraine is using sophisticated Westernsupplied weapons to help shoot down Russias missiles and drones as well as send artillery fire into Russianheld areas of the country. Moscows fullscale invasion on Feb. 24 has gone awry putting pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin as his ground forces struggle to hold ground and advance. He said in his New Years address to the nation that 2022 was a year of difficult necessary decisions. Putin insists he had no choice but to send troops into Ukraine because it threatened Russias security an assertion condemned by the West which says Moscow bears full responsibility for the war. Russia is currently observing public holidays through Jan. 8. Drones missiles and artillery shells launched by Russian forces also struck areas across Ukraine. Five people were wounded in the Monday morning shelling of a Ukrainecontrolled area of the southern Kherson region its Ukrainian Gov. Yaroslav Yanushevich said on Telegram. The Russian forces attacked the city of Beryslav the official said firing at a local market likely from a tank. Three of the wounded are in serious condition and are being evacuated to Kherson Yanushevich said. Seven drones were shot down over the southern Mykolaiv region according to Gov. Vitali Kim and three more were shot down in the southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region Gov. Valentyn Reznichenko said. In the Dnipropetrovsk region a missile was also destroyed according to Reznichenko. He said that energy infrastructure in the region was being targeted. Ukraines Air Force Command reported Monday that 39 Iranianmade exploding Shahed drones were shot down overnight as well as two Russianmade Orlan drones and a X59 missile. We are staying strong the Ukrainian defense ministry tweeted. A blistering New Years Eve assault killed at least four civilians across the country Ukrainian authorities reported and wounded dozens. The fourth victim a 46yearold resident of Kyiv died in a hospital on Monday morning Klitschko said. Multiple blasts rocked the capital and other areas of Ukraine on Saturday and through the night. The strikes came 36 hours after widespread missile attacks Russia launched Thursday to damage energy infrastructure facilities and the unusually quick followup alarmed Ukrainian officials. In Russia a Ukrainian drone hit an energy facility in the Bryansk region that borders with Ukraine Bryansk regional governor Alexander Bogomaz reported on Monday morning. A village was left without power as a result he said.,2023-01-02T20:55:51Z
31,"After an epic journey ends, what happens next?",Migrants allowed into the US don't stay at the border long - this is how they decide where to go now.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64069243,For El Paso migrants an epic journey is followed by a long wait Published To reach the US border Wilmary Camacho had to cross thousands of miles of mountains and jungles battling diseases and facing violent robberies all while travelling with her fourmonthold baby and threeyearold daughter. The jungle was the hardest part because of all the things you see there. There were dead people and wild animals. It was so dangerous the Venezuelan told the BBC. And we had the kids. Every day was more complicated with the kids. This week Ms Camacho was in El Paso Texas cradling her eldest daughter Mia atop a pile of donated blankets on a pavement in the citys downtown her husband a few metres away smoking a cigarette as they plotted their next move. Their journey is far from over. This is just a midpoint she said. Were headed to Denver. Weve got our tickets now Ms Camacho 23 is one of more than two million migrants who have arrived at the USMexico border in the last year a number that many fear will spike even further as the US heads into 2023. Nowhere is this more true than El Paso where swelling numbers of migrants in recent weeks have left local officials scrambling for resources. Like the Camacho family life in the US for most of the migrants claiming asylum begins when they present themselves to Customs and Border Patrol CBP officers at the US border. Once processed the migrants recently nearly 1500 each day in El Paso alone are released to local officials and organisations who feed them give them water and donations of clothes and provide temporary shelter. These groups also help the migrants coordinate their travel plans. Most hope to travel further into the US to be reunited with family or to find work while they await court dates that will ultimately determine their status in the country. On the streets of El Paso this week the BBC spoke to migrants on their way to places across the US. Some are classified as sponsored migrants who have relatives or friends offering financial support while others are travelling with no connections at all and with little more than the clothes on their back. Im going to New York. Ive got a niece there said Elois Acelvedo a Nicaraguan woman who said she was left penniless after being robbed while travelling alone on the journey north. A guy from the city came yesterday and told us theyd help. But nobodys come back. For Ms Acelvedo getting to New York is urgent. Choking back tears she explained that her three sons the youngest under a year old remain in Nicaragua and are depending on her. Its a sacrificelife in Nicaragua was impossible. I could have worked like a slave and made just 30 25 a week. Even food was so expensive she said. Now thank God Ill be able to send money. Thats all I want. Elianny Rodriguez a Dominican told the BBC that the hardest part was waiting for whats next. She plans to head to New Jersey where she has friends and relatives among the states already large Dominican diaspora. Ive been here for nine days in this craziness just waiting to get started on a better future for my family she said. Then the plan will be to wait for that court date and not cause any mischief. Just have a normal life. Ms Rodriguez may not have long to wait. On Wednesday afternoon she explained that city officials had got her a ticket on the next guagua a Dominican term for a bus to New York. All they told me is that the government was helping people get to New York she said. Were very thankful. Life for the migrants waiting in El Paso is one spent waiting for answers about their transport or simply for their next meal. Rodrigo Antonio Hernandez a 52yearold former army officer who said he fled Venezuela after being tortured by government agents said that most of the migrants are simply hoping to stay out of trouble and not anger the local community before they move on. On a recent morning Mr Hernandez was directing other migrants to clean up their sleeping area and throw away rubbish while they waited for a delivery from a local food bank. We have to be disciplined he told the BBC pointing to a tightly rolled up blanket and packed bag in a city park. We dont want people to think we shouldnt be here or for the community to not want us. If we get this area dirty people will have a bad idea about migrants. A few have no plan at all other than to start life afresh in the US. Among them are Chilean citizen Kenia Contreras and her Venezuelan husband Anthony Ybarra who along with their fouryearold son arrived in the US after a trip that took them across nine countries from Chile to the US border. Ive got family here in Atlanta and Houston Mr Ybarra said a wide grin across his face. But we dont want to interrupt anyones life. If other people can do it with no help so can we. Were here to work not to ask for things. Where theyll go and what theyll do there they say remains a mystery. I want to give this kid a better lifewell go where God lets us go Ms Contreras said pointing to her son as he sat on the pavement playing with the shoelaces of a nearby adult. Whatever it takes even if I have to sell caramels or candy. And when we find work well give it our all. Additional reporting by Alexandra Ostasiewicz,2022-12-23T00:00:21Z
32,The week in audio: Bone Valley; There Are No Greater Heroes; The Crowning of Everest and more – review,"A true-crime documentary puts others in the shade, a trip down psych-rock’s memory lane is full of charm – and Everest the immersive wayBone Valley (Lava for Good)There Are No Greater Heroes (Sam Tyler and Thomas Freeman) | Apple podcastsThe Crowning of Evere…",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/07/bone-valley-podcast-review-there-are-no-greater-heroes-tony-caro-and-john-the-crowning-of-everest-song-for-belper-pet-classics-classic-fm,Bone Valley Lava for Good There Are No Greater Heroes Sam Tyler and Thomas Freeman Apple podcasts The Crowning of Everest BBC Radio 4 BBC Sounds Song For Belper BBC Radio 4 BBC Sounds Pet Classics Classic FM globalplayer Whew but I have a treat for all you fans of truecrimecoldcasecluebycluetothetruth podcasts. Bone Valley about a 1987 murder in Florida and the farreaching consequences of its seemingly botched police investigation is an absolute doozy. Dogged and meticulous with a spine of moral certainty it makes other true crime podcasts look lazy simply through its completeness. Not only do journalist Gilbert King and his assistant reporter Kelsey Decker take you through every single step from background to current situation they do so without artifice or ego. I enjoy a spot of cleverme script flummery but Bone Valley aims to be thorough and direct and is all the more hard hitting because of it. King is known for his Pulitzer prizewinning 2012 book Devil in the Grove about the Groveland boys four young black men falsely accused of raping a white woman in 1949. After giving a lecture to some Florida lawmakers about this work King is approached by Scott Cupp a judge who tells him about another miscarriage of justice. In the late 1980s Leo Schofield was convicted of the murder of his wife Michelle and has been in prison ever since. Hes innocent says Cupp. Just read the court transcripts. So King does and finds himself compelled to investigate. It takes him and Decker four years. I dont want to give too much away but be assured that Bone Valley is not one of those true crime shows that starts brilliantly and then falls away because the investigator cant track down the real perpetrator or finds them but doesnt get to speak to them. Here King and Decker not only solve the murder of Michelle they also solve another seemingly unconnected cold case. Which all sounds exciting I suppose. Gripping definitely. Not only did 19yearold Michelle die violently we get a strong sense of who she was throughout the series but Schofield has been in prison for this crime for almost 35 years. Every one of his appeals has failed he has not even been bailed for good behaviour. The podcast is also a grinding indictment of the local police forces and the US criminal justice system each time you think Leo must surely be absolved the system fails him. This is a long series nine episodes each more than an hour long. Its occasionally gruesome but never gratuitous. The journalism is excellent. Decker who initially seems naive and nervous has every fact straight and Kings ethical rage occasionally expressed through swearing is the driving force that keeps everything on track. Bone Valley came out at the end of last year but has somehow slipped under the radar in the UK. I thoroughly recommend it and if you get to the end and agree that Schofield is the wrong man theres a petition that you can sign to try to get his conviction independently reviewed. Once youve got through all that you might need something lighter. Or at least sweeter. So why not try There Are No Greater Heroes which came out last week. A firsttime podcast from music promoter Sam Tyler this is a lovely tale about a British psychfolk trio Tony Caro and John who released one record All on the First Day in the early 1970s and then disappeared from view. Tyler decides to track them down and tell their story. The result is a short slight heartwarming threeparter combining the ordinary and exceptional. Tony and Caro the remaining members are still very good friends and their retelling of the bands story is engaging. John who died of cancer in 2005 was a careful archivist so the trios songs threaded throughout are beautifully recorded. Nothing combines memory feeling youth and age like music and this documentary series understands that. Heroes indeed. A more conventional heroism is examined by Radio 4s The Crowning of Everest about the 1953 expedition that finally got two men Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay to the top of the highest mountain on Earth. Ably presented by explorer Wade Davis this series is best heard on headphones. Sound designer Richard Hannaford goes to town snow crunching underfoot flags flapping in the wind and its beautifully atmospheric with some lovely details Norgay left a small bag of sweets at the top to honour the Buddhist gods Hillary refused a photo of himself but took shots of the view to prove they made it. This is far from a manconquersnature series instead making a case for allying the Everest climb with Elizabeth IIs coronation and an examination of what it was to be British. Hillary was a Kiwi Norgay NepaleseIndian. Both were treated as Brits claimed by the Commonwealth. More Britishness and more music in the chatty and funny Radio 4 documentary Song for Belper about that little known genre of pop songs commissioned by town councils and presented by Jason Hazeley and Peter Curran. I was crylaughing from the opening song Frankie Vaughans Im Going Back to Stockport. And if you want something just as sweetly daft and British why not flip back to New Years Eve on Classic FM which offered an antifireworks soothing soundtrack for pets Makes you proud.,2023-01-07T17:00:24Z
33,Flight PS752: Families of victims met with harassment from Iran,"Canadian intelligence is probing ""hostile state actors"" who are intimidating Iranian dissidents.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64176568,Flight PS752 Families of victims met with harassment from Iran Published Three years after the downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 in Tehran families and friends of those who died are still pushing for accountability. But they have been greeted with multiple hurdles along the way including threats to their safety. Reza Akbari is one of many IranianCanadians who lost a loved one on 8 January 2020 when Flight 752 destined for Kyiv Ukraine was shot down by two antiaircraft missiles after it took off in Tehran. All 176 were killed. As the former president of the Iranian Heritage Society in the city of Edmonton where 13 of the victims lived Mr Akbari has pushed for Iran to be held accountable for the deaths. But ahead of one planned demonstration in October Mr Akbari felt fearful for his safety. He had been receiving frightening and suspicious phone calls from strangers. In one instance he believed he was being followed by two men when he was out walking in a deserted part of town. While the men only asked him for directions he took it as a sign that he was being watched by people close to the Iranian government. Was it a coincidence I dont think so he added. I thought that was a sign that they could come whenever. That they have eyes on me and have people all over. Mr Akbari has reported this incident and others to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and he is not the only one. Several Iranian dissidents have spoken out in recent months about being harassed and intimidated on Canadian soil saying they have been monitored and followed at protests or have had their social media or email addresses hacked. Others like Kaveh Shahrooz a Torontobased human right lawyer who sits on a legal advisory committee for families of Flight 752 victims say their loved ones in Iran have been visited by agents in the country as a result of them speaking out abroad. Canadas spy agency the Canadian Security Intelligence Service confirmed to the BBC in a statement that they are aware that Canadians especially those in diaspora communities are being monitored and intimidated by hostile state actors including the Islamic Republic of Iran. The tactics and tools used for such purposes include cyber espionage and threats designed to silence those who speak out publicly against them CSIS spokesperson Eric Balsam said adding that the agency is investigating these incidents. Iran has been accused of harassing dissidents in other countries abroad including the US and the UK. Last November Met Police guarded the offices of Iran International an independent Farsilanguage news channel in the the UK after British intelligence intercepted discussions of planning actual attacks against dissident journalists. The regime has also harassed BBC Persia journalists in the UK prompting BBC lawyers to file a complaint to the UN. In 2021 the FBI said it was looking for a man alleged to have hired private investigators to spy on people speaking out against the Iranian regime in all three countries. Iran has no formal relations with Canada and has not commented publicly on the CSIS probe. The BBC has reached out to Irans foreign ministry for comment. Hamed Esmaeilion who lost his wife Parisa Eghbalian and their nineyearold daughter Reera on Flight 752 said he has been the subject of harassment and attacks on social media since he began advocating for his family and other victims three years ago. He said he believes the intimidation tactics from the Iranian government are part of a propaganda machine against anyone who is standing in front of them. Despite these threats Mr Esmaeilion and others have continued to push for a coordinated international effort to have Iran answer for what happened. They have also lent their support to Iranians who have taken to the streets by the thousands calling for freedom and justice following the death of 22yearold Mahsa Amini last September after she was detained by Irans morality police. People are recognising more and more that all these crimes are connected Mr Shahrooz said. It didnt start with Mahsa Amini or even the plane. These crimes go back 43 years with the birth of the Islamic Republic. Of those who perished on the flight 138 had ties to Canada including 55 citizens and 30 permanent residents. The dead included 29 children 53 university students four newlywed couples and eight entire families. Irans Civil Aviation Organisation has blamed the downing of the plane which occurred amid heightened tensions in the region following the US killing of top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad on human error. But in a 2021 report Canada said Irans government was fully responsible for the incident though there was no evidence to suggest it was premeditated. In the three years since the tragedy the victims families have explored multiple avenues to get answers from Iran including taking the unusual step last year of filing a case in the International Criminal Court which does not typically hear from civilians. In its filing the families argued that the downing of the plane was a war crime and part of systematic attacks on civilians amounting to a crime against humanity Mr Shahrooz said. Their case however has yet to be heard. A separate effort to have the International Civil Aviation Organisation probe the incident reached a significant milestone in late December after the governments of the UK Canada Ukraine and Sweden announced they had jointly requested that Iran submit to binding arbitration arguing the missiles that downed the flight were launched unlawfully and intentionally. The Iranian government now has six months to respond a spokesperson for Canadas foreign affairs ministry told the BBC. If it fails to do so Canada and the coalition countries will move to litigate the issue before the International Court of Justice. The move is a big step forward for the victims families who say the fight for accountability has consumed their daily lives in the last three years. I used to like to travel I used to go golfing but I dont enjoy it any more said Kourosh Doustshenas a Winnipeg man who lost his fiance Forough Khadem on Flight 752. What I do now is I want to make sure could I write another letter to somebody Did I forget something On a personal level I need closure and the only way I can have closure in my life is if I know the truth.,2023-01-08T01:44:23Z

Guitarist Neal Schon said keyboardist Jonathan Cain has no right to use Journey for politics. Cain whose wife Paula White is an advisor to the former president played the groups anthem at an event at Mr Trumps estate in Florida last month. Cain argued that Schon was the one who had been damaging Journeys reputation. The pair are already in a legal battle over spending on the band credit card. Dont Stop Believin was first released in 1981 but enjoyed a resurgence after being used in TV shows The Sopranos and Glee. It was written by Cain and Schon in collaboration with singer Steve Perry who left the band in 1998. Last month it was revealed to be the moststreamed song from 1981 in the UK. In his letter reported by Variety Schon said his bandmates performance at the America First Policy Institutes Experience and Gala at MarALago was a harmful use of the brand. The America First Policy Institute is run by former senior Trump White House officials and has been described as an administration in waiting should he be reelected. Paula WhiteCain was Mr Trumps spiritual advisor during his presidency and chairs the AFPIs Center for American Values. Schons letter said Although Mr Cain is free to express his personal beliefs and associations when he does that on behalf of Journey or for the band such conduct is extremely deleterious to the Journey brand as it polarizes the bands fans and outreach. Journey is not and should not be political. The letter continued His politics should be his own personal business. He should not be capitalizing on Journeys brand to promote his personal political or religious agenda to the detriment of the band. In a statement Cain said Schon should look in the mirror when he accuses me of causing harm to the Journey brand. He accused his bandmate of taking or threatening legal action against numerous people connected with the band of sending bullying toxic emails and of recklessly spending Journeys money. If anyone is destroying the Journey brand it is Neal and Neal alone Cain concluded. In November it was reported that Schon claimed he had been denied access to the groups American Express card and its records while Cain accused his bandmate of putting more than 1m 827000 in improper personal expenses on the card. Their current acrimony may make for frosty relations when they go back on tour in January with singer Arnel Pineda who joined the group in 2007.,2022-12-22T10:42:41Z
35,19-year sentence for second ringleader in Michigan governor kidnap plot - BBC,19-year sentence for second ringleader in Michigan governor kidnap plot  BBCView Full Coverage on Google News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64112234,19year sentence for second ringleader in Michigan governor kidnap plot Published A man who prosecutors say was one of the ringleaders in a plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has been sentenced to more than 19 years in prison. Barry Croft Jr 47 was convicted in August of plotting to kidnap the Democratic governor two years ago. His prison sentence comes a day after another coconspirator Adam Fox 39 was sentenced to 16 years. Prosecutors had asked for life in prison for Croft. The defendants targeted Ms Whitmer because of stringent Covid19 restrictions she imposed early in the pandemic according to prosecutors. Croft was more culpable than Fox US District Judge Robert Jonker said when handing down the 235 month sentence on Wednesday according to US media reports. I think he was the person who gave Mr Fox something to grab on to he said. In August a jury determined that the two men were guilty of kidnapping conspiracy. They were also convicted of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction as they allegedly planned to obtain a bomb to blow up a bridge to thwart a police response to the planned kidnapping. Croft a native of Bear Delaware was convicted on a separate explosives charge. It was the second federal trial for both after a mistrial early this year. Both men were members of rightwing militia group Three Percenters. Fox and others had planned to kidnap Ms Whitmer from her vacation home at gunpoint and take her to stand trial on bogus treason charges according to prosecutors. The militia groups kidnap plot was largely motivated by their opposition to public health measures during the early days of the Covid19 pandemic. However prosecutors said Fox of Wyoming Michigan had hoped to spark a second American revolution and push the US into armed conflict ahead of what proved to be a contentious presidential race in November 2020. Back in August lawyers representing Fox and Croft suggested the pair had been incapable of mounting such a plot. They argued the men had been entrapped or improperly induced into the crime by an undercover FBI operation. Two men involved in the plot who pleaded guilty to kidnapping conspiracy charges testified for the prosecution at the first federal trial as well as during Fox and Crofts retrial.

He told Good Morning America their mother would have been saddened at the arguments which he said were fuelled by briefings to a divisive press. Prince Harry said there had to be accountability before reconciliation. He also ruled out a return to the UK as a working royal. Prince Harry told ABC News TV interviewer Michael Strahan a return to such a life within the Royal Family in the UK would be unsurvivable. Thats really sad because thats essentially breaking the relationship between us said Prince Harry in an interview about his memoir Spare. In the book Prince Harry speaks about the traumatic legacy of his mothers death in a car accident in 1997 but says Diana would now be sad to see the dispute between her sons with Prince Harry seeing William as his arch nemesis as well as beloved brother and describing a physical altercation between them. I think she would be looking at it long term to know that there are certain things that we need to go through to be able to heal the relationship he said in the interview. He also spoke about his relationship with Camilla the Queen Consort saying they hadnt spoken for a long time but he didnt think of her as an evil stepmother. Prince Harry said he had compassion for her as the third person within my parents marriage. She had a reputation and an image to rehabilitate. And whatever conversations happened whatever deals or trading was made right at the beginning she was led to believe that would be the best way of doing it he told the US news show. These claims presenting Prince Harrys view of events have so far not drawn a response from Buckingham Palace or Kensington Palace. In an ITV interview on Sunday Prince Harry had accused the Royal Family of failing to defend his wife Meghan with overnight viewing figures showing it had been seen by an audience of 4. 1 million viewers behind Call the Midwife and Happy Valley which drew over 5 million that evening. Prince Harry highlighted the controversy over a Jeremy Clarkson newspaper column saying the silence is deafening from the Royal Family about what he called the horrific Sun article. He contrasted this with the quick action taken after a race row at a Buckingham Palace reception. The Clarkson article about Meghan had described how the columnist was dreaming of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant Shame and throw lumps of excrement at her. Later taken down by the Sun and prompting an apology from the paper and Mr Clarkson the article was described by Prince Harry as horrific and hurtful and cruel towards my wife. The world is asking for some form of comment from the monarchy. But the silence is deafening. To put it mildly he said. Everything to do with my wife after six years they havent said a single thing. He also said he believed that stereotyping about Meghan as an American actress divorced biracial had been a barrier to Prince William and Catherine welcoming her in to the family. Very quickly it became Meghan versus Kate he said of how the relationship was presented in the media also saying it was fair to say almost from the getgo that the sistersinlaw did not get on. Prince Harry accused the Royal Family of getting into bed with the devil to improve its image which he linked to relationships between certain members of the family and the tabloid press. The prince contrasted the lack of a royal response to the Clarkson article with the events that followed an encounter at Buckingham Palace between Lady Susan Hussey and Ngozi Fulani just three weeks earlier. While attending an event Ms Fulani a black British charity founder was challenged repeatedly by Lady Hussey about where she was really from. The controversy that followed produced a rapid apology. Prince Harry defended Lady Hussey saying she had never meant any harm at all. But he contrasted the reconciliatory meeting held between her and Ms Fulani at Buckingham Palace with the response to Prince Harry and Meghans complaints. Prince Harry also gave an interview to Anderson Cooper for 60 Minutes on CBS News which aired a few hours after ITVs show and saw him speaking about Camilla the Queen Consort and her relationship with the media. Cooper asked the duke about comments he made in his memoir suggesting that Camilla would be less dangerous if she was happy. Prince Harry said Camillas need to rehabilitate her image and her willingness to forge relationships with the British press made her dangerous. And with a family built on hierarchy and her on the way to being Queen Consort there was going to be people or bodies left in the street because of that. The ITV interview had also returned to Prince Harry and Meghans previous claim made in a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey that a member of the Royal Family had raised questions about the skin colour of their future child. Prince Harry again did not name the individual and suggested this might have been a case of unconscious bias rather than racism. Asked if he would see the questioning as racist he said I wouldnt not having lived within that family. He rejected that he had accused members of the Royal Family of racism in the Oprah interview saying the British press had said that. Prince Harry made repeated criticisms of the tabloid press saying that it was his lifes work to change the media landscape.,2023-01-09T13:18:53Z

Authorities have five days to charge suspects who have been formally arrested. In total more than 1500 people were detained after the riot. Concerns about potential further protests have prompted a large security forces deployment in Brazils capital. Brazilian Federal Police sources say those being formally charged are being held at the forces academy in Brasilia where most of the arrested were taken after the riot and some have been moved to other facilities. The authorities have warned that some of the detainees who have been released may ultimately be arrested amid the ongoing investigation. And they have expressed concern that more rallies could be organised by hardline supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. According to a memo from federal prosecutors seen by the BBC proBolsonaro groups have been calling for mega demonstrations to take place across Brazilian state capitals. The document also outlines a number of additional security measures being taken including the immediate arrest of suspects blocking roads and invading public buildings as well as stiff fines of 20000 Brazilian Reais 3830 3168 an hour for participants. Companies that provide logistical and financial support to people carrying out these activities are liable for fines of up to 100000 Brazilian Reais 19181 15828. The government is also asking that social media platforms take steps to suspend accounts that have been involved in planning criminal behaviour. On Tuesday Brazilian lawmakers approved a federal intervention that has seen military forces deployed to carry out police and security duties in Brasilia. On Wednesday morning there were dozens of troops from Brazils Force National on duty near Brazils presidential palace and Congress. Their deployment has met the approval of many local residents who say they are wary of another riot like the one that happened on 8 January. This is all necessary so that we get back to work said Braslia resident Anderson Rodrigues. When they attacked the Congress and presidential palace I felt as if I couldnt do anything about it. They should charge everyone involved in the riot with a crime he added. Not just the people who were here but the people who financed it as well.,2023-01-11T15:12:36Z

</li><li>Jan. 6 committee's final report finds Trump was '…",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64071723,Donald Trump accused of multipart conspiracy over 6 January attack Published The congressional panel investigating last years attack on the US Capitol has accused former President Donald Trump of a multipart conspiracy to overturn his election defeat three months earlier. The panel has released its final 845page report on the attack. It places the blame for the 6 January 2021 storming of Congress squarely on the former president. It also recommends barring Mr Trump from public office in the future. He did not cooperate with the panel and declared the final report a witch hunt after its release. Over 18 months the committee held 10 public hearings and interviewed more than 1000 witnesses including Trump administration officials and staff Trump family members Capitol police officers rioters militia members and more. On Monday the panel of seven Democrats and two Republicans recommended the justice department investigate Mr Trump who is mounting another White House campaign for aiding an insurrection and three other federal crimes. The Democratic chairman of the select committee Bennie Thompson of Mississippi wrote in a foreword to the eightchapter report that it was once unimaginable that the president of the United States would incite a mob to march on the Capitol. Here are the six key findings which were released on Thursday night 1 Trump made false claims which aides told him were untrue The committee said that Mr Trumps decision to falsely declare victory on election night 2020 was premeditated and that only his lawyer Rudy Giuliani supported this action. The former president soon began making unfounded claims of widescale voter fraud and continued to do so with more frequency after the election was called for Joe Biden. The committee points to their interviews with several advisers and lawyers close to Mr Trump who say they did not believe these claims of fraud or could find no evidence of the phenomenon. Most notable among those voices was former Attorney General William Barr who told the committee during a deposition I made it clear that I did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen and putting out this stuff which I told the president was expletive. The president continued to sow election conspiracies over the coming weeks though top Trump administration officials testified they informed him the claims were not true. 2 Trumps rhetoric brought rioters to Washington The committee makes the argument that the attack on the Capitol was sparked by Mr Trump himself. In addition to Mr Trumps repeated fraud claims the committee points to a 19 December 2020 tweet in which the former president wrote Big protest in DC on January 6th. Be there will be wild In depositions and court documents rioters and militia members who were present at the Capitol that day cited Mr Trumps tweet as their rationale for coming to Washington. The committee cited men like Robert Morss who was found guilty of assaulting officers during the Capitol breach. Mr Morss believed January 6th stood for the moment when 1776 Will Commence Again because President Trump asked them to Be there Will be Wild the report states. The committee also cites Secret Service warnings that people were planning to come to Washington on January 6 and threatening to be wild. 3 Trump failed to act during the riot The committee argues that Mr Trump did not take action as the January 6 attack commenced and that he ignored warnings coming from Congress that a serious attack was unfolding. Some of their conclusion rests on the testimony of former White House staffer Cassidy Hutchinson who appeared in a dramatic hearing earlier this year and also gave depositions about the chaos she says she witnessed in the White House that day. According to a transcript of her testimony released on Thursday a former White House ethics lawyer had attempted to coach Ms Hutchinson before she gave evidence to the committee The less you remember the better. The committee also cites communications between lawmakers trapped in the Capitol and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows who was receiving an increasingly desperate barrage of pleas from members of Congress who were forced into hiding. Texts from Hope Hicks one of Mr Trumps most loyal aides summed up the dismay among staff at the White House. Ms Hicks texted Ivanka Trumps chief of staff Julie Radford after the riot saying we all look like domestic terrorists now. She also texted a White House lawyer Im so upset. Everything we worked for wiped away. 4 Farright groups planned then acted Tips about armed groups targeting Washington and even the Capitol specifically started coming in December 2020. The report notes that the FBI was sent messages circulating on groups run by the farright Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. There is only one way. It is not signs. Its not rallies. Its expletive bullets said one. Capitol Police and Secret Service agents who are responsible for protecting the president received similar messages from insiders and others. Some specifically named the Capitol as a focus for potentially violent activity. Some of the chatter came from private encrypted chat apps but other messages were publicly visible on proTrump websites and Twitter. Members of the farright groups ended up among the crowds inside the Capitol on 6 January. Alongside the report the committee released dozens of raw transcripts of testimony provided by witnesses in closeddoor sessions. Several of Mr Trumps biggest supporters on the farright fringes such as Alex Jones and white nationalist Nick Fuentes refused to answer questions citing their constitutional right to avoid selfincrimination. But testimony from others including Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio indicated mutual suspicion infighting and conspiratorial thinking among the farright factions involved in the riot. Rhodes was convicted of seditious conspiracy and other charges last month and potentially faces decades in prison while Mr Tarrio is currently on trial. 5 Trump tried to pressure his vicepresident to overturn the results Part of Mr Trumps plan to remain in office revolved around a controversial reading of the US Constitution which he believed allowed VicePresident Mike Pence who would preside over the election certification to declare him the victor. On 6 January Mr Trump attempted to call Mr Pence shouting at aides to get him on the phone the report states. The former president then falsely told Mr Pence he had the power to intervene in the certification. Witnesses told the committee that at one point Mr Trump called the vicepresident a wimp and said he was not tough enough. Addressing a crowd on 6 January Mr Trump said he hoped Mr Pence would do the right thing. Later in the midst of the attack rioters would chant Hang Mike Pence as they stormed the Capitol. 6 Trump should be barred from holding public office The panel has made 11 recommendations as a result of its investigation. One cites the constitution which states an individual who has taken an oath to support the US Constitution but has engaged in an insurrection or given aid or comfort to the enemies of the Constitution can be disqualified from office. Mr Trump was referred to the Department of Justice for assisting or aiding an insurrection.,2022-12-23T04:15:46Z

Criminology student Bryan Kohberger 28 was flown out of Monroe county after earlier appearing in court where he had agreed to be extradited. His arrest brought some relief to Moscow a college town traumatised by the killings six weeks earlier. But the public has yet to learn what evidence led police to him. University of Idaho students Xana Kernodle Ethan Chapin Kaylee Goncalves and Madison Mogen were found dead in their beds on 13 November. Amid criticism from the community and victims parents police released one lead last month asking the public for help finding a white Hyundai Elantra. The car was seen near the home where the pupils were found stabbed in their beds. After the arrest on Thursday police said the Elantra had been located. But a murder weapon described as a fixed blade knife has not been found. Officials have still said nothing about Mr Kohbergers alleged motive or how if at all he knew the four victims. On Tuesday he arrived at a courthouse in Monroe County Pennsylvania wearing a red prison jumpsuit and handcuffs. He did not respond to shouted questions from journalists. During the hearing he told the judge that he was not on any medications that would impair his judgement and mouthed the words I love you to his family members that were present according to ABC News. The probablecause affidavit which would include the reasons for his arrest will remain sealed until he appears in court in Idaho to formally face charges according to Bill Thompson the prosecutor for Latah County Idaho. After being put on a state police plane to Idaho he was escorted by officers from Pennsylvania state police to a waiting vehicle which was part of a convoy of five vehicles that made its way across the Idaho border NBC news reported. He will meet a new lawyer in Idaho and a trial date will eventually be set. Officials have already said they will charge him with four homicides and burglary. Suspect studied criminology With many details of the case still unknown attention has been focused on Mr Kohbergers criminology studies. Officials on Friday confirmed the suspect was a PhD student in criminal justice and criminology at Washington State University just a few miles from Moscow. He had only recently moved to Idaho after graduating with an undergraduate psychology degree earlier this year from DeSales University a Catholic school in Pennsylvania. In a post to Reddit that was removed after his arrest a person identifying themselves as Bryan Kohberger and associated with DeSales sought participants for a research project to understand how emotions and psychological traits influence decisionmaking when committing a crime. In particular this study seeks to understand the story behind your most recent criminal offence with an emphasis on your thoughts and feelings throughout your experience the post said. Neither police nor the university have confirmed that the post was made by the suspect. Mr Kohberger graduated in 2012 from the Pleasant Valley High School in Brodheadsville Pennsylvania and later returned to work as a security guard there. A local news report from 2018 mentioned how he helped to save a faculty members life there after she suffered an asthma attack. A lawyer for the suspect Jason LaBar told US media that Mr Kohbergers father had flown to Idaho to drive back to Pennsylvania with him after his semester at Washington State University ended in December. He told NBC that he had spoken to the father about the crosscountry drive. Everything was ordinary and he saw nothing unusual about it he said. Former classmates told The New York Times that Mr Kohberger was the black sheep of his graduate programme and that he made some fellow students uncomfortable. In a statement on Sunday Mr Kohbergers family said they felt for the Idaho victims families adding that they will love and support our son and brother... and promote his presumption of innocence.,2023-01-03T22:11:57Z

</li><li>U.S. Supreme…",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64103825,Title 42 US Supreme Court keeps Trumpera border policy in place Published The US Supreme Court has voted to keep in place a controversial Trumpera policy that blocked thousands of people from crossing the USMexico border. Title 42 gives the government power to automatically expel undocumented migrants seeking entry. The potential lifting of the policy had prompted concerns that the number of migrants at the border would rise. The Biden administration said it would comply with the ruling but called for reform of immigration policy. Bill Cassidy a Republican senator for Louisiana said removing Title 42 would have made our border crisis worse and the White House seemed willing to let that happen. Glad to see the Supreme Court step in to preserve it but we need a permanent solution he said on Twitter. Miguel Colmenares a Venezuelan migrant in the Mexican border city of Tijuana said It breaks my heart that we have to keep waiting. I dont know what Im going to do I havent got any money and my familys waiting for me the 27yearold told Reuters news agency. The Title 42 policy applied about 2. 5 million times since March 2020 was originally due to expire on 21 December but two days before the deadline Chief Supreme Court Justice John Roberts blocked its termination. The courts decision was in response to an emergency appeal from some Republicanled states who had asked for the policy to remain in place. On Tuesday the Supreme Court voted 54 to extend the temporary stay ordered by Justice Roberts while the case moved forward. Additionally the nine Supreme Court justices will hear oral arguments on whether the states can intervene in defence of the policy. Arguments are likely to take place in February or March 2023. A decision is due by the end of June. The decision will be a blow to immigration activists who had sued to end Title 42 arguing it was contrary to international obligations to give people asylum. Proponents of Title 42 and officials in many border communities however argued that lifting the policy would lead to an increase in arrivals at the border putting a strain on resources. In court documents filed last week Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the government recognised that the end of Title 42 orders would probably lead to disruption and a temporary increase in unlawful border crossings. The government in no way seeks to minimize the seriousness of that problem she added. But the solution to that immigration problem cannot be to extend indefinitely a publichealth measure that all now acknowledge has outlived its publichealth justification. On the border local governments and humanitarian organisations have warned that they are already overburdened and illprepared for an additional influx of asylum seekers. In the Texan city of El Paso for example authorities last week declared a state of emergency and set up a makeshift 1000bed shelter in the citys convention centre as part of a wider plan to cope with the growing number of asylum seekers on the citys streets. Speaking to the BBC last week officials in the city had expressed concern that they would be unable to handle a significant increase in the number of people that need food shelter and help arranging transport further into the US. Susan Goodell chief executive of El Pasoans Fighting Hunger Foodbank said local nongovernmental organisations had been told to expect additional spikes if Title 42 was lifted.,2022-12-27T22:43:35Z

Robert K Hur was appointed in 2018 by Mr Trump as the chief federal law enforcement officer in Maryland. He left that position when President Trump left office in 2021. The US Department of Justice appoints special counsels when an investigation poses potential conflicts of interest. On Thursday US Attorney General Merrick Garland said it was in the public interest to appoint a special counsel to oversee the inquiry into Mr Biden. This appointment underscores for the public the Departments commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters and to making decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law Mr Garland said. Veteran war crimes prosecutor Jack Smith serves as special counsel in the departments inquiry into Mr Trumps alleged mishandling of classified information. Mr Hur a graduate of Harvard College and Stanford Law School has most recently been in private practice as a partner at the Washington DC office of Gibson Dunn Crutcher. Prior to his appointment as the US Attorney in Maryland he also served as the top aide to thenDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Over more than a decade as a federal prosecutor he has worked on cases involving national security public corruption and other issues. He was an aide to Christopher Wray at the justice department before Mr Wrays 2017 appointment to head the FBI. Mr Hur has also clerked for the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist a conservative jurist who was appointed to the Supreme Court by Ronald Reagan. Thomas Dupree a former Deputy Assistant Attorney General who works alongside Mr Hur at Gibson Dunn Cratcher described him as a very talented lawyer a man of excellent judgment and a man of the highest integrity. I think it was an excellent choice by the Attorney General to put someone of Robs calibre in this role he said. As special counsel Mr Hur will have the authority to prosecute any crimes identified during the probe or to refer any matters for prosecution by federal attorneys. Mr Garland will retain the power to overrule his decisions but must notify Congress if that happens. Mr Hur vowed to conduct the assigned investigation with fair impartial and dispassionate judgment. I intend to follow the facts swiftly and thoroughly without fear or favour and will honour the trust placed in me to perform this service he said.,2023-01-12T23:23:21Z

The public service broadcasting system is undoubtedly facing an existential threat warns the former chair of ITV and much else Peter Bazalgette. ITV he reveals has not yet decided to reapply for a new public service broadcasting PSB licence because it does not know what the terms will be. He and many others await the new broadcasting bill which they hope will ensure that when their services are placed on a digital platform they do not own such as Amazon Apple Samsung LG Sky and Virgin they will be given prominence and not charged ridiculous amounts. If not says Bazalgette ITV has plenty of nonpublic service broadcasting options. Elsewhere in PSBland there is heartening news for it now seems unlikely that the broadcasting bill will propose privatising Channel 4. But what next Who knows. Could someone please offer an inspiring vision of what its contribution to public service broadcasting should be in the next 40 years I understand why independent producers opposed privatisation with such vehemence it threatened their businesses but what about inspiring content Does anyone have a vision of the future to compare with that which Jeremy Isaacs its founding chief executive displayed all those years ago And then there is the BBC the public service mothership just turned 100 years old. But what is its vision for the next decade let alone the next century Two noble baronesses hit the nail on the head very forcibly in a recent House of Lords debate. It remains unclear what the BBC wants to be beyond being a significant player in this global media world said the Conservative peer Lady Stowell chair of the communications committee who once worked for the BBC. She wanted to know what it will do more of continue to do stop doing. Lady Dido Harding also a Conservative peer fired a warning shot across the bows of Broadcasting House saying No investment proposal should be approved without a compelling longterm vision and plan. The implication was clear she hadnt seen one. But then neither have the rest of us. Its a creative vision thing is there such a thing at and for the BBC There is certainly a business vision as there should be. The BBC board is now top heavy with bankers and business people. The chairman Richard Sharp tutored Rishi Sunak at Goldman Sachs. The corporations future as a big international business is pretty secure. A commercial version of it could survive without the licence fee but is that what we want Contrary to what the Daily Mail constantly argues the BBC is now a very efficient business not least because of the herculean efforts of its director general Tim Davie who while cleverly blunting government allegations of bias has been faced with a 30 cut in real spending power. With inflation rampant further cuts are in the offing which will follow already announced cuts in essential elements of its public service offering including news local radio and the World Service. But no one voted for that. All this is happening without the people who pay for the corporation the licencefee payers being consulted. The oftused slogan Its your BBC is in danger of ringing hollow. The BBC has never been very good on consultation or accountability as I know from my many years presenting Radio 4s Feedback where all too often there was little feedback. When it came to inviting executives on to the programme the press office would often intervene saying We dont think this is the right time to say something on this subject. I would reply that the right time was whenever the listener wanted an answer. There were some wonderful exceptions such as the departing controller of Radio 3 Alan Davey who would always come on and answer anything. He got it. Well he had been inside and outside the BBC a very public servant. When it came to inviting presenters and producers on to Feedback requests also had to go through the press office and if an interview took place a press officer would usually be present at their insistence. The good producers and there are a lot of them would roll their eyes at being chaperoned. And I got the impression that some press officers were a bit embarrassed by their role as minders. Davie has said he is determined to improve accountability and I am sure he is sincere but he then presses on with his business plan and those cuts as though he were running a commercial business not this muchloved publicly owned publicly financed institution. Of course someone has to take decisions we cant all vote on what has to go but surely we would have a right to expect the ability to discuss priorities For example Radio 4 Extra may go online only thus depriving some older listeners of a service they greatly value while leaving them with many other much more expensive services they could well do without. They had no say. The BBC director of speech radio Mohit Bakaya says rather mystifyingly that the online move of 4 Extra is not a done deal. Maybe protests could tip the balance. BBC Four which originally commissioned the wonderful series Detectorists is also to go online and become an archive channel only. Again no consultation. BBC local radio is being decimated despite its role in serving so many communities. Truly to use Bazalgettes phrase an existential threat and with a new year we need new thinking pause the BBC cuts now postpone the debate on the privatisation of Channel 4 and ensure ITV remains a public service broadcaster while conducting a proper crossparty inquiry into the future of the public service media and how to pay for it. We have by accident and design created a landscape and a tradition of public service broadcasting in this country that is very special. We must be vigilant of it. It would be careless not to say criminal to let it slip away. Roger Bolton is a former BBC executive and journalist.

45,BBC Subtitle Guidelines,This document is intended to serve as the basis for all subtitle work across the BBC and to guide subtitle creators and developers.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/guides/subtitles/,The BBC Academy has produced an online guide to subtitling. If you are new to subtitling please start there. Subtitles are primarily intended to serve viewers with loss of hearing but they are used by a wide range of people around 10 of broadcast viewers use subtitles regularly increasing to 35 for some online content. The majority of these viewers are not hard of hearing. This document describes closed subtitles only also known as closed captions. Typically delivered as a separate file closed subtitles can be switched off by the user and are not burnt in to the image. There are many formats in circulation for subtitle files. In general the BBC accepts EBUTT part 1 with STL embedded for broadcast and EBUTTD for online only content. For a full description of the delivery requirements see the File format section. The Subtitle Guidelines describe best practice for authoring subtitles and provide instructions for making subtitle files for the BBC. This document brings together documents previously published by Ofcom and the BBC and is intended to serve as the basis for all subtitle work across the BBC prepared and live online and broadcast internal and supplied. Who should read this Anyone providing or handling subtitles for the BBC authors of subtitle respeakers stenographers editors producers and distributors of content developers of software tools for authoring validating converting and presenting subtitles anyone involved in controlling subtitle quality and compliance. In addition if you have an interest in accessibility you will find a lot of useful information here. What prior knowledge is expected The editorial guidelines in the Presentation section are written in plain English requiring only general familiarity with subtitles. In contrast to follow the technical instructions in the File format section you will need good working knowledge of XML and CSS. It is recommended that you also familiarise yourself with Timed Text Markup Language and SMPTE timecodes. What should I read for... An overview of subtitlesread this introduction and the first few sections of Presentation Timing Identifying speakers and EBUTT and EBUTTD Documents in detail. Scanning through the exampleswill also give you a good understanding of how subtitles are made. Editing and styling subtitlesread the Presentation section for text format and timing guidelines. Making subtitle files for onlineonly contentif your software does not support EBUTTD you will need to create an XML file yourself. Assuming you are familiar with XML and CSS start with Introduction to the TTML document structure and Example EBUTTD document. Then follow the quick EBUTTD howto.

For help with requirements for specific subtitle documents contact the commissioning editor. The following symbols are used throughout this document. Examples indicate the appearance of a subtitle. When illustrating bad or unrecommended practice the example has a strikethough like this. Note that the subtitle style used here is only an approximation. It should not be used as a reference for realworld files or processors. counterexample Most of this document applies to both online and broadcast subtitles. When there are differences between subtitles intended for either platform this is indicated with one of these flags online applies only to subtitles for online use not for broadcast. broadcast applies to broadcastonly subtitles not online. When no broadcast or online flag is indicated the text applies to all subtitles. Subtitles must conform to one of two specifications EBUTTD subtitles intended for online distribution only or EBUTT version 1. 0 for broadcast and online. Sections that only apply to one of the specifications are indicated by one of these flags EBUTTD or EBUTT 1. 0. Specific actual values are indicated with double quotes like this 2. These values must be used without the quotes. Descriptions of values are given in brackets a number between 1 and 3. When several values are possible they are separated by a pipe 1 2 3. Example sections are inset and styled with a side border. tttt... Code examples use explicit namespace prefixes for the avoidance of doubt Since this is a longish sort of a document weve added in some features to help navigation When the window is wide enough the table of contents appears on the lefthand side instead of the top. The table of contents by default just shows the top level headings headings with a chevron to the right of them can be expanded by clicking the chevron. If you want a direct link to a given section you can click on the link icon to the righthand side of the heading. Clicking on a heading in the main part of the document will make sure the heading is visible in the table of contents. This version covers editorial and technical contribution and presentation guidelines including resources to assist developers in meeting these guidelines. Future versions will build on these guidelines or describe changes or address issues raised. We intend to release small updates often. Amongst many smaller tweaks the following changes accumulated so far since version 1 released in September 2016 are notable Minor clarifications to presentation guidelines in response to comments received for example the wording about use of reaction shots to gain time. the word rate for live subtitles has been adjusted to 160180wpm from 130150wpm. the use of numbers. capitalisation in speech.

Good subtitling is an art that requires negotiating conflicting requirements. On the whole you should aim for subtitles that are faithful to the audio. However you will need to balance this against considerations such as the action on the screen speed of speech or editing and visual content. For example if you subtitle a scene where a character is speaking rapidly these are some of the decisions you may have to make Can viewers read the subtitles at the rate of speech Should you edit out some words to allow more time Can subtitles carry over to the next scene so they catch up with the speaker Should you use cumulative subtitles to convey the rhythm of speech for example if rapping If there are shot changes within the sequence should the subtitles be synchronised with those Should you use one two or three lines of subtitles Should you change the position of the subtitle to avoid obscuring important visual information or to indicate the speaker Clearly it is not possible or advisable to provide a set of hard rules that cover all situations. Instead this document provides some guidelines and practical advice. Their implementation will depend on the content the genre and on the subtitlers expertise. If there is time for verbatim speech do not edit unnecessarily. Your aim should be to give the viewer as much access to the soundtrack as you possibly can within the constraints of time space shot changes and onscreen visuals etc. You should never deprive the viewer of wordssounds when there is time to include them and where there is no conflict with the visual information. However if you have a very busy scene full of action and disconnected conversations it might be confusing if you subtitle fragments of speech here and there rather than allowing the viewer to watch what is going on. Dont automatically edit out words like but so or too. They may be short but they are often essential for expressing meaning. Similarly conversational phrases like you know well actually often add flavour to the text. It is not necessary to simplify or translate for deaf or hardofhearing viewers. This is not only condescending it is also frustrating for lipreaders. If the speaker is in shot try to retain the start and end of their speech as these are most obvious to lipreaders who will feel cheated if these words are removed. Do not take the easy way out by simply removing an entire sentence. Sometimes this will be appropriate but normally you should aim to edit out a bit of every sentence. Avoid editing out names when they are used to address people. They are often easy targets but can be essential for following the plot. Your editing should be faithful to the speakers style of speech taking into account register nationality era etc. This will affect your choice of vocabulary. For instance register mother vs mum deceased vs dead intercourse vs sex nationality mom vs mum trousers vs pants era wireless vs radio hackney cab vs taxi. Similarly make sure if you edit by using contractions that they are appropriate to the context and register. In a formal context where a speaker would not use contractions you should not use them either. Regional styles must also be considered e. g. it will not always be appropriate to edit Ive got a cat to Ive a cat and I used to go there cannot necessarily be edited to Id go there. Having edited one subtitle bear your edit in mind when creating the next subtitle. The edit can affect the content as well as the structure of anything that follows. Avoid editing by changing the form of a verb. This sometimes works but more often than not the change of tense produces a nonsense sentence. Also if you do edit the tense you have to make it consistent throughout the rest of the text. Sometimes speakers can be clearly lipread particularly in closeups. Do not edit out words that can be clearly lipread. This makes the viewer feel cheated. If editing is unavoidable then try to edit by using words that have similar lipmovements. Also keep as close as possible to the original word order. If the onscreen graphics are not easily legible because of the streamed image size or quality the subtitles must include any text contained within those graphics which provide contextual information. This must include the speakers identity what they do and any organisations they represent. Other displayed information affected by legibility problems that must be included in the subtitle includes phone numbers email addresses postal addresses website URLs or other contact information. If the information contained within the graphics is offtopic from what is being spoken then the information should not be replicated in the subtitle. Do not edit out strong language unless it is absolutely impossible to edit elsewhere in the sentence deaf or hardofhearing viewers find this extremely irritating and condescending. If the BBC has decided to edit any strong language then your subtitles must reflect this in the following ways. If the offending word is bleeped put the word BLEEP in the appropriate place in the subtitle in caps in a contrasting colour and without an exclamation mark. BLEEP If only the middle section of a word is bleeped do not change colour midword fBLEEPing If the word is dubbed with a euphemistic replacement e. g. frigging put this in. If the word is nonstandard but spellable put this in too frerlking If the word is dubbed with an unrecognisable sequence of noises leave them out. If the sound is dipped for a portion of the word put up the sounds that you can hear and three dots for the dipped bit Keep your f... ing nose out of it. Never use more than three dots. If the word is mouthed use a label So MOUTHS f... ing what In Teletext which is used to display subtitles on some broadcast platforms line length is limited to 37 fixedwidth monospaced characters since at least 3 of the 40 available bytes are used for control codes. Other platforms use proportional fonts making it impossible to determine the width of the line based on the number of characters alone. In this case lines are constrained by the width of the region in which they are displayed. Guidelines for both platforms are summarised in the table below. If targeting both online and broadcast platforms you must apply both constraints i. e. ensure that the number of characters within a region does not exceed 37. Each subtitle should comprise a single complete sentence. Depending on the speed of speech there are exceptions to this general recommendation see live subtitling short and long sentences below A maximum subtitle length of two lines is recommended. Three lines may be used if you are confident that no important picture information will be obscured. When deciding between one long line or two short ones consider line breaks number of words pace of speech and the image. Subtitles and lines should be broken at logical points. The ideal linebreak will be at a piece of punctuation like a full stop comma or dash. If the break has to be elsewhere in the sentence avoid splitting the following parts of speech article and noun e. g. the table a book preposition and following phrase e. g. on the table in a way about his life conjunction and following phraseclause e. g. and those books but I went there pronoun and verb e. g. he is they will come it comes parts of a complex verb e. g. have eaten will have been doing However since the dictates of space within a subtitle are more severe than between subtitles line breaks may also take place after a verb. For example We are aiming to get a better television service. Line endings that break up a closely integrated phrase should be avoided where possible. We are aiming to get a better television service. Line breaks within a word are especially disruptive to the reading process and should be avoided. Ideal formatting should therefore compromise between linguistic and geometric considerations but with priority given to linguistic considerations. broadcast Left right and centre justification can be useful to identify speaker position especially in cases where there are more than three speakers on screen. In such cases line breaks should be inserted at linguistically coherent points taking eyemovement into careful consideration. For example We all hope you are feeling much better. This is left justified. The eye has least distance to travel from hope to you. We all hope you are feeling much better. This is centre justified. The eye now has least distance to travel from are to feeling. Problems occur with justification when a short sentence or phrase is followed by a longer one. Oh. He didnt tell me you would be here. In this case there is a risk that the bottom line of the subtitle is read first. Oh. He didnt tell me you would be here. This could result in only half of the subtitle being read. Allowances would therefore have to be made by breaking the line at a linguistically noncoherent point Oh. He didnt tell me you would be here. Oh. He didnt tell me you would be here. When making a choice between one long line or two short lines you should consider the background picture. In general long and thin subtitles are less disruptive of picture content than are short and fat subtitles but this is not always the case. Also take into account the number of words line breaks etc. broadcast In dialogue sequences it is often helpful to use horizontal displacement in order to distinguish between different speakers. Short and fat subtitles permit greater latitude for this technique. Short sentences may be combined into a single subtitle if the available reading time is limited. However you should also consider the image and the action on screen. For example consecutive subtitles may reflect better the pace of speech. In most cases verbatim subtitles are preferred to edited subtitles see this research by BBC RD so avoid breaking long sentences into two shorter sentences. Instead allow a single long sentence to extend over more than one subtitle. Sentences should be segmented at natural linguistic breaks such that each subtitle forms an integrated linguistic unit. Thus segmentation at clause boundaries is to be preferred. For example When I jumped on the bus I saw the man who had taken the basket from the old lady. Segmentation at major phrase boundaries can also be accepted as follows On two minor occasions immediately following the war small numbers of people were seen crossing the border. There is considerable evidence from the psycholinguistic literature that normal reading is organised into word groups corresponding to syntactic clauses and phrases and that linguistically coherent segmentation of text can significantly improve readability. Random segmentation must certainly be avoided On two minor occasions immediately following the war small numbers of people etc. In the examples given above no markers are used to indicate that segmentation is taking place. It is also acceptable to use sequences of dots three at the end of a tobecontinued subtitle and two at the beginning of a continuation to mark the fact that a segmentation is taking place especially in legacy subtitle files. Good linebreaks are extremely important because they make the process of reading and understanding far easier. However it is not always possible to produce good linebreaks as well as welledited text and good timing. Where these constraints are mutually exclusive then welledited text and timing are more important than linebreaks. The recommended subtitle speed is 160180 wordsperminute WPM or 0. 33 to 0. 375 second per word. However viewers tend to prefer verbatim subtitles so the rate may be adjusted to match the pace of the programme. Most subtitle authoring tools calculate the WPM and can be configured to give a warning when the word rate exceeds a certain WPM threshhold. You can also calculate the WPM manually see box. Based on the recommended rate of 160180 words per minute you should aim to leave a subtitle on screen for a minimum period of around 0. 3 seconds per word e. g. 1. 2 seconds for a 4word subtitle. However timings are ultimately an editorial decision that depends on other considerations such as the speed of speech text editing and shot synchronisation. When assessing the amount of time that a subtitle needs to remain on the screen think about much more than the number of words on the screen this would be an unacceptably crude approach. Do not dip below the target timing unless there is no other way of getting round a problem. Circumstances which could mean giving less reading time are Give less time if the target timing would involve clipping a shot or crossing into an unrelated empty containing no speech shot. However always consider the alternative of merging with another subtitle. Give less time to avoid editing out words that can be lipread but only in very specific circumstances i. e. when a word or phrase can be read very clearly even by nonlipreaders and if it would look ridiculous to take out or change the word. Avoid editing out catchwords if a phrase would become unrecognisable if edited. Give less time if a joke would be destroyed by adhering to the standard timing but only if there is no other way around the problem such as merging or crossing a shot. In a news item or factual content the main aim is to convey the what when who how why. If an item is already particularly concise it may be impossible to edit it into subtitles at standard timings without losing a crucial element of the original. These may be similarly hard to edit. For instance a detailed explanation of an economic or scientific story may prove almost impossible to edit without depriving the viewer of vital information. In these situations a subtitler should be prepared to vary the timing to convey the full meaning of the original. Try to allow extra reading time for your subtitles in the following circumstances Try to give more generous timings whenever you consider that viewers might find a word or phrase extremely hard to read without more time. Aim to give more time when there are several speakers in one subtitle. Allow an extra second for labels where possible but only if appropriate. When there is a lot happening in the picture e. g. a football match or a map allow viewers enough time both to read the subtitle and to take in the visuals. If for example two speakers are placed in the same subtitle and the person on the right speaks first the eye has more work to do so try to allow more time. Give viewers more time to read long figures e. g. 12353. Aim for longer timing if your subtitle crosses one shot or more as viewers will need longer to read it. Slower timings should be used to keep in sync with slow speech. It is also very important to keep your timings consistent. For instance if you have given 312 for one subtitle you must not then give 412 to subsequent subtitles of similar length unless there is a very good reason e. g. slow speakeronscreen action. If there is a pause between two pieces of speech you may leave a gap between the subtitles but this must be a minimum of one second preferably a second and a half. Anything shorter than this produces a very jerky effect. Try to not squeeze gaps in if the time can be used for text. Impaired viewers make use of visual cues from the faces of television speakers. Therefore subtitle appearance should coincide with speech onset. Subtitle disappearance should coincide roughly with the end of the corresponding speech segment since subtitles remaining too long on the screen are likely to be reread by the viewer. When two or more people are speaking it is particularly important to keep in sync. Subtitles for new speakers must as far as possible come up as the new speaker starts to speak. Whether this is possible will depend on the action on screen and rate of speech. The same rules of synchronisation should apply with offcamera speakers and even with offscreen narrators since viewers with a certain amount of residual hearing make use of auditory cues to direct their attention to the subtitle area. The subtitles should match the pace of speaking as closely as possible. Ideally when the speaker is in shot your subtitles should not anticipate speech by more than 1. 5 seconds or hang up on the screen for more than 1. 5 seconds after speech has stopped. However if the speaker is very easy to lipread slipping out of sync even by a second may spoil any dramatic effect and make the subtitles harder to follow. The subtitle should not be on the screen after the speaker has disappeared. Note that some decoders might override the end timing of a subtitle so that it stays on screen until the next one appears. This is a noncompliant behaviour that the subtitle author and broadcaster have no control over. A subtitle or an explanatory label should always be on the screen if someones lips are moving. If a speaker speaks very slowly then the subtitles will have to be slow too even if this means breaking the timing conventions. If a speaker speaks very fast you have to edit as much as is necessary in order to meet the timing requirements see timing. Your aim is to minimise lag between speech and the appearance of the subtitle. But sometimes in order to meet other requirements e. g. matching shots you will find it difficult to avoid slipping slightly out of sync. In this case subtitles should never appear more than 2 seconds after the words were spoken. This should be avoided by editing the previous subtitles. It is permissible to slip out of sync when you have a sequence of subtitles for a single speaker providing the subtitles are back in sync by the end of the sequence. If the speech belongs to an outofshot speaker or is voiceover commentary then its not so essential for the subtitles to keep in sync. Do not bring in any dramatic subtitles too early. For example if there is a loud bang at the end of say a twosecond shot do not anticipate it by starting the label at the beginning of the shot. Wait until the bang actually happens even if this means a fast timing. Do not simultaneously caption different speakers if they are not speaking at the same time. It is likely to be less tiring for the viewer if shot changes and subtitle changes occur at the same time. Many subtitles therefore start on the first frame of the shot and end on the last frame. If you have to let a subtitle hang over a shot change do not remove it too soon after the cut. The duration of the overhang will depend on the content. Avoid creating subtitles that straddle a shot change i. e. a subtitle that starts in the middle of shot one and ends in the middle of shot two. To do this you may need to split a sentence at an appropriate point or delay the start of a new sentence to coincide with the shot change. If one shot is too fast for a subtitle then you can merge the speech for two shots provided your subtitle then ends at the second shot change. Bear in mind however that it will not always be appropriate to merge the speech from two shots e. g. if it means that you are thereby giving the game away in some way. For example if someone sneezes on a very short shot it is more effective to leave the Atchoo on its own with a fast timing or to merge it with what comes afterwards than to anticipate it by merging with the previous subtitle. Where possible avoid extending a subtitle into the next shot when the speaker has stopped speaking particularly if this is a dramatic reaction shot. Never carry a subtitle over into the next shot if this means crossing into another scene or if it is obvious that the speaker is no longer around e. g. if they have left the room. Some film techniques introduce the soundtrack for the next scene before the scene change has occurred. If possible the subtitler should wait for the scene change before displaying the subtitle. If this is not possible the subtitle should be clearly labelled to explain the technique. JOHN And what have we here Several techniques can be used to assist the viewer in identifying speakers. The BBCs preferred techniques are colour and single quotes but other techniques exist in legacy subtitle files and subtitles repurposed from nonUK sources. Reuse of existing files with legacy techniques is acceptable but unless specifically requested new content should not use legacy techniques. The available techniques include Colour This is the preferred method that should be used in most cases. Single quotes Used to indicate an outofvision speaker such as someone speaking via telephone or to distinguish between in and outofvision voices when both are spoken by the same character or by the narrator and therefore using the same colour e. g. a narrator who is sometimes invision. Arrows Used to indicate the direction of outofvision sounds when the origin of the sound is not apparent. infrequently used Label Can be used to resolve ambiguity as to who is speaking. Horizontal positioning This is a legacy technique for identifying invision speakers but it is still used for indicating offscreen speech. It is also used with Vertical positioning to avoid obscuring important information. Dashes This is a legacy technique. Must only be used with colour when unavoidable. Use colours to distinguish speakers from each other see Colours. This is the preferred method for identifying speakers. Where the speech for two or more speakers of different colours is combined in one subtitle their speech runs on i. e. you dont start a new line for each new speaker. Did you see Jane I thought she went home. However if two or more WHITE text speakers are interacting you have to start a new line for each new speaker preceded by a dash. By convention the narrator is indicated by a yellow colour. This is a legacy technique that is no longer used in new content for identifying invision speakers it may be present in files created before it was deprecated. Use colour instead. Horizontal positioning is used in combination with arrows to indicate outofvision voices. broadcast Where colours cannot be used you can distinguish between speakers with placing. Put each piece of speech on a separate line or lines and place it underneath the relevant speaker. You may have to edit more to ensure that the lines are short enough to look placed. Try to make sure that pieces of speech placed right and left are joined at the hip if possible so that the eye does not have to leap from one side of the screen to the other. Not When characters move about while speaking the caption should be positioned at the discretion of the subtitler to identify the position of the speaker as clearly as possible. This is a legacy technique that is no longer used for new content but may be present in files created before it was deprecated or sourced from outside the UK. Use colour to indicate a change of speaker. If colour cannot be used or if colour is being used but two consecutive speakers are both assigned the same colour put each piece of speech on a separate line and insert a white dash not a hyphen before each piece of speech thereby clearly distinguishing different speakers lines. If possible align the dashes so that they are proud of the text although not all formats support this well. Found anything If this is the next new weapon were in big trouble. The longest line should be centred on the screen with the shorter linelines leftaligned with it not centred. If one of the lines is long inevitably all the text will be towards the left of the screen but generally the aim is to keep the lines in the centre of the screen. Note that dashes only work as a clear indication of speakers when each speaker is in a separate consecutive shot. If you need to distinguish between an invision speaker and a voiceover speaker use single quotes for the voiceover but only when there is likely to be confusion without them single quotes are not normally necessary for a narrator for example. Confusion is most likely to arise when the invision speaker and the voiceover speaker are the same person. Put a single quotemark at the beginning of each new subtitle or segment in live but do not close the single quotes at the end of each subtitlesegment only close them when the person has finished speaking as is the case with paragraphs in a book. Ive lived in the Lake District since I was a boy. I never want to leave this area. Ive been very happy here. I love the fresh air and the beautiful scenery. If more than one speaker in the same subtitle is a voiceover just put single quotes at the beginning and end of the subtitle. What do you think about it Im not sure. The single quotes will be in the same colour as the adjoining text. When two white text speakers are having a telephone conversation you will need to distinguish the speakers. Using single quotes placed around the speech of the outofvision speaker is the recommended approach. They should be used throughout the conversation whenever one of the speakers is out of vision. Hello. Victor Meldrew speaking. Hello Mr Meldrew. Im calling about your car. Single quotes are not necessary in telephone conversations if the outofvision speaker has a colour. Double quotes... can suggest mechanically reproduced speech e. g. radio loudspeakers etc. or a quotation from a person or book. Start the quote with a capital letter He said Youre so tall. Generally colours should be used to identify speakers. However when an outofshot speaker needs to be distinguished from an inshot speaker of the same colour or when the source of offscreenoffcamera speech is not obvious from the visible context insert a greater than or less than symbols to indicate the offcamera speaker. If the outofshot speaker is on the left or right type a left or right arrow or next to their speech and place the speech to the appropriate side. Left arrows go immediately before the speech followed by one space right arrows immediately after the speech preceded by one space. Do come in. Are you sure When are you leaving I was thinking of going at around 8 oclock in the evening. When I find out where he is youll be the first to know. NOT When I find out where he is youll be the first to know. If possible make the arrow clearly visible by keeping it clear of any other lines of text i. e. the text following the arrow and the text in any lines below it are aligned. However not all formats support hanging indent well. When I find out where he is youll be the first to know The arrows are always typed in white regardless of the text colour of the speaker. If an offscreen speaker is neither to the right nor the left but straight ahead do not use an arrow. online Arrow characters and can be used instead of and for onlineonly subtitles. If you are unable to use any other technique use a label to identify a speaker but only if it is unclear who was speaking or when more than four characters are speaking requiring a shared colour. Type the name of the speaker in white caps regardless of the colour of the speakers text immediately before the relevant speech. If there is time place the speech on the line below the label so that the label is as separate as possible from the speech. If this is not possible put the label on the same line as the speech centred in the usual way. JAMES What are you doing with that hammer JAMES What are you doing If you do not know the name of the speaker indicate the gender or age of the speaker if this is necessary for the viewers understanding MAN I was brought up in a closeknit family. When two or more people are speaking simultaneously do the following regardless of their colours Two people BOTH Keep quiet all white text Three or more ALL Hello all white text TOGETHER Yes No different colours with a white label The subtitle file formats used by the BBC allow nonpresentation metadata that can be used to include information about the speaker of a subtitle. Including this information is useful for searching identifying speakers and other purposes. Most subtitles are typed in white text on a black background to ensure optimum legibility. Background colours are no longer used. Use labels to identify nonhuman speakers ROBOT Hello sir Use leftaligned sound labels for alerts BUZZER A limited range of colours can be used to distinguish speakers from each other. In order of priority All of the above colours must appear on a black background to ensure maximum legibility. Once a speaker has a colour they should keep that colour. Avoid using the same colour for more than one speaker it can cause a lot of confusion for the viewer. The exception to this would be content with a lot of shifting main characters like EastEnders where it is permissible to have two characters per colour providing they do not appear together. If the amount of placing needed would mean editing very heavily you can use green as a floater that is it can be used for more than one minor character again providing they never appear together. White can be used for any number of speakers. If two or more white speakers appear in the same scene you have to use one of a number of devices to indicate who says what see Identifying Speakers. Subtitle fonts are determined by the platform the delivery mechanism and the client as detailed below. Since fonts have different character widths the final pixel width of a line of subtitles cannot be accurately determined when authoring. See also Line Breaks. To minimise the risk of unwanted line wrapping use a wide font such as Reith Sans Verdana or Tiresias when authoring the subtitles. Presentation processors usually use a narrower font e. g. Arial so the rendered line will likely fit within the authored area. Note that platforms may use different reference fonts when resolving the generic font family name specified in the subtitle file. For example the HbbTV standard maps both default and proportionalSansSerif to Tiresias whereas IMSC maps proportionalSansSerif only to any font with substantially the same dimensions for rendered text as Arial. See also Conformance with IMSC 1. 0. 1 Text Profile. The final displayed size of closed captions text is determined by multiple factors the instructions in the subtitle file the processor and the set of installed fonts available to it the device screen size and resolution and on some devices also userdefined preferences. While it is not possible or advisable to predetermine the final subtitle size adhering to the below guidelines will ensure that subtitles are legible at a typical distance from the device and that lines do not reflow or overflow for the vast majority of users. In particular the final size should never be larger than the authored size so that the subtitler can ensure that important parts of the of the video are not obscured. Font size should be set to fit within a line height of 8 of the active video height. Use mixed upper and lower case. This font height is the largest size needed for presentation and is an authoring requirement. Use a wide font such as Reith Sans when authoring subtitles see Fonts and ttsfontFamily. If that is not the font used to present it then the alternative is likely to be a narrower font so if you author in a wide font you can be reasonably confident that lines will not reflow. No changes need to be made to other styling attributes to accommodate processors potentially using a smaller font however care needs to be taken when positioning subtitles in case a smaller font is used as the following examples show Authored font size correct positioning The processor displays the larger font size as authored. The region not displayed is indicated with a dotted line. Reduced font size wrong positioning The regions ttsdisplayAlign is set to before so with a smaller font size the text moves up and the second line obscures the mouth. Reduced font size correct positioning To avoid this set the regions ttsdisplayAlign property to center or after. Authored font size large region Line breaks were used to position the subtitles lower within the region. Reduced font size large region The line breaks are resized with the rest of the text. Reduced font size defined region Better to define the region so that it does not cover the face and avoid white space. See also Additional adjustments for Reith Sans font. Depending on device size viewing distance screen resolution etc. a processor such as a player may choose to reduce but not to increase the authored font size so that the final presentation font size is smaller than the authored font size. For example on a very large TV the subtitles may appear too large when displayed at the original authored size so the processor can apply a scaling factor or a multiplier of less than 1 to the value of ttsfontSize. For most screen sizes the preferred font size is between 0. 6 and 0. 8 times the required authoring font size. For small mobile phones e. g. 4 diagonal screen size the presentation size should be the unmodified authored font size i. e. a multiplier of 1. Along with reading distance the physical height of the video when displayed on the devices screen is the most direct determinant of font size as a proportion of video height. In practice however a processor may not know the actual physical height and may have to rely on other data for example pixel size and resolution which may not be reliable indicators of physical size. The examples below illustrate devices and their recommended multipliers. For devices that support configurable sizes a recommended range is shown. When the processor cannot determine the screen size it should use the unmodified authored size to mitigate the risk of illegibly small text i. e. default to a multiplier of 1. In the absence of other information a default size of 0. 5 subtended at the eye may be used to derive the default line height and calculate the multiplier however this may be too small for some devices. See also Additional adjustments for Reith Sans font. EBUTTD Most sansserif fonts used on the web have a normal line height of around 120 of the font size. This is specified within the font file by adding up the ascender descender and line gap metrics. However Reith Sans has a wider line spacing of around 133. If too small a line height is used for the font size then descenders can get hidden by the background area of the next line which is highly undesirable. This presents an authoring difficulty given that the requirements set out in this document are to fit the text within a line spacing of 8 of the video height and the line spacing is based on the line height the font size and the font family what combination of values should be used The subtitle document specifies a list of fonts as is required by these guidelines see ttsfontFamily however the correct combination of font size and line height differs depending on which font is actually used. When presenting using HTML and CSS there is currently no mechanism to allow different settings to be applied based on the used font family the normal value of ttslineHeight sets the line height based on the font size and the used font but the resulting line height is unpredictable. To work around this the following recommendations apply within documents The ttslineHeightshould be set to a value used for common fonts such as 120. The ttsfontSizeshould be set so that the computed font size multiplied by the line height is no more than 8 of the video height. The following recommendations apply within processors if the Reith Sans font is being used and if the line height is less than 133 Compute an adjustmentfactor that is the line height divided by 133. For example if a line height of 120 is chosen then the adjustment ratio would be 120133 0. 9. Reduce the font size multiplying its computed value by the adjustment factor. Increase the line height dividing its computed value by the adjustment factor. This approach should mean that a processor presents text at the desired line spacing regardless of whether Reith Sans is being used or not. Although the text will appear slightly smaller in Reith Sans the readability improvements associated with the design and spacing of Reith Sans are considered to offset any negative impact from the reduction in size. An added effect is that since text generally renders wider in Reith Sans than other fonts this approach also helps to mitigate against the risk of unwanted line breaks. The width of the background is calculated per line rather than being the largest rectangle that can fit all the displayed lines in. The height of the background should be the height of the line there should be no gap between background areas of successive lines. On both sides of every line the background colour should extend by the width of 0. 5 em. If the subtitles are intended for broadcast a limited set of characters must be used. Use alphanumeric and English punctuation characters AZ az 09. The following characters can be used Do not use accents. Additional characters are supported but not normally used see Appendix 1 In addition to the characters above the following characters are allowed if the subtitles are intended for online use only. online replaces to indicate music arrows can replace and. The subtitles should overlay the video image and may be placed within any black bars present within the video at the top or bottom. online For 169 video in landscape mode subtitles should not be placed outside the central 90 vertically and the central 75 horizontally. Regions can be extended horizontally to allow extra space for line padding. online For online subtitles the subtitle rendering area root container in EBUTTD should exactly overlap the video player area unless controls or other overlays are visible in which case the system should take steps to avoid the subtitles being obscured by the overlays. These could include Scaling the root container to avoid overlap Detecting and resolving screen area clashes by moving subtitles around Pausing the presentation while the overlays are visible. The normally accepted position for subtitles is towards the bottom of the screen Teletext lines 20 and 22. Line 18 is used if three subtitle lines are required. In obeying this convention it is most important to avoid obscuring onscreen captions any part of a speakers mouth or any other important activity. Certain special programme types carry a lot of information in the lower part of the screen e. g. snooker where most of the activity tends to centre around the black ball and in such cases top screen positioning will be a more acceptable standard. Generally vertical displacement should be used to avoid obscuring important information such as captions while horizontal displacement should be reserved for indicating speakers see Identifying Speakers. In some cases vertical displacement is not sufficient to avoid obscuring important information for example when placing the captions above a graphic would cover a face. In such cases horizontal positioning may be used. Some platforms e. g. online media player support the display of subtitles under the image. If the media player is embedded in the page the layout should change to accommodate the subtitle display. When subtitles are displayed under the image area vertical displacement will be ignored by the device and only horizontal positioning will be used e. g. to identify speakers. Prepared subtitles are normally centrealigned within a subtitle region that is horizontally centred relative to the video. Live subtitles cued blocks and cumulative are normally leftaligned. Other horizontal positioning may be used to Avoid obscuring important information such as captions and mouths when vertical positioning is not sufficient see below. Indicate the direction of offscreen sounds. See arrows for offscreen voices. Identifying invision speakers legacy technique. See Identifying speakers with horizontal positioning. In some cases vertical positioning is not sufficient to avoid obscuring important information for example when placing the captions above a graphic would cover a face. In such cases prioritise the important information over speaker identification using horizontal positioning if appropriate. To indicate a sarcastic statement use an exclamation mark in brackets without a space in between Charming To indicate a sarcastic question use a question mark in brackets Youre not going to work today are you Use caps to indicate when a word is stressed. Do not overuse this device text sprinkled with caps can be hard to read. However do not underestimate how useful the occasional indication of stress can be for conveying meaning Its the BOOK I want not the paper. I know that but WHEN will you be finished The word I is a special case. If you have to emphasise it in a sentence make it a different colour from the surrounding text. However this is rare and should be used sparingly and only when there is no other way to emphasise the word. Use caps also to indicate when words are shouted or screamed HELP ME However avoid large chunks of text in caps as they can be hard to read. online Subtitles for online exclusives can use italics for emphasis instead of caps this is an experimental option and should not be included for general use. If this approach is adopted italics should be used in most instances with caps reserved for heavier emphasis e. g. shouting. Note that there is currently little research to indicate the effectiveness of italics for emphasis in subtitles. To indicate whispered speech a label is most effective. WHISPERS Dont let him near you. However when time is short place brackets around the whispered speech Dont let him near you. If the whispered speech continues over more than one subtitle brackets can start to look very messy so a label in the first subtitle is preferable. Brackets can also be used to indicate an aside which may or may not be whispered. Indicate questions asked in an incredulous tone by means of a question mark followed by an exclamation mark no space You mean youre going to marry him This section deals with accents in speech and dialects. For accented characters see Typography. Do not indicate accent as a matter of course but only where it is relevant for the viewers understanding. This is rarely the case in seriousstraight news reports but may well be relevant in lighter factual items. For example you would only indicate the nationality of a foreign scientist being interviewed on Horizon or the Ten OClock News if it were relevant to the subject matter and the viewer could not pick the information up from any other source e. g. from their actual words or any accompanying graphics. However in a drama or comedy where a characters accent is crucial to the plot or enjoyment the subtitles must establish the accent when we first see the character and continue to reflect it from then on. When it is necessary to indicate accent bear in mind that although the subtitlers aim should always be to reproduce the soundtrack as faithfully as possible a phonetic representation of a speakers foreign or regional accent or dialect is likely to slow up the reading process and may ridicule the speaker. Aim to give the viewer a flavour of the accent or dialect by spelling a few words phonetically and by including any unusual vocabulary or sentence construction that can be easily read. For a Cockney speaker for instance it would be appropriate to include quite a few caffs missus and aints but not to replace every single dropped h and g with an apostrophe. You should not correct any incorrect grammar that forms an essential part of dialect e. g. the Cockney you was. A foreign speaker may make grammatical mistakes that do not render the sense incomprehensible but make the subtitle difficult to read in the given time. In this case you should either give the subtitle more time or change the text as necessary I and my wife is being marrying four years since and are having four childs yes This could be changed to I and my wife have been married four years and have four childs yes The speech text alone may not always be enough to establish the origin of an overseasregional speaker. In that case and if it is necessary for the viewers understanding of the context of the content use a label to make the accent clear AMERICAN ACCENT All the evidence points to a plot. Remember that what might make sense when it is heard might make little or no sense when it is read. So if you think the viewer will have difficulty following the text you should make it read clearly. This does not mean that you should always subedit incoherent speech into beautiful prose. You should aim to tamper with the original as little as possible just give it the odd tweak to make it intelligible. Also see Accents The above is more applicable to factual content e. g. News and documentaries. Do not tidy up incoherent speech in drama when the incoherence is the desired effect. If a piece of speech is impossible to make out you will have to put up a label saying why SLURRED But I love you Avoid subjective labels such as UNINTELLIGIBLE or INCOMPREHENSIBLE or HE BABBLES INCOHERENTLY. Speech can be inaudible for different reasons. The subtitler should put up a label explaining the cause. APPLAUSE DROWNS SPEECH TRAIN DROWNS HIS WORDS MUSIC DROWNS SPEECH HE MOUTHS Long speechless pauses can sometimes lead the viewer to wonder whether the subtitles have failed. It can help in such cases to insert explanatory text such as INTRODUCTORY MUSIC LONG PAUSE ROMANTIC MUSIC If a speaker speaks very slowly or falteringly break your subtitles more often to avoid having slow subtitles on the screen. However do not break a sentence up so much that it becomes difficult to follow. If a speaker stammers give some indication but not too much by using hyphens between repeated sounds. This is more likely to be needed in drama than factual content. Letters to show a stammer should follow the case of the first letter of the word. Im gggoing home WWWhat are you doing If a speaker hesitates do not edit out the ums and ers if they are important for characterisation or plot. However if the hesitation is merely incidental and the ums actually slow up the reading process then edit them out. This is most likely to be the case in factual content and too many ums can make the speaker appear ridiculous. When the hesitation or interruption is to be shown within a single subtitle follow these rules To indicate a pause within a sentence insert three dots at the point of pausing then continue the sentence immediately after the dots without leaving a space. Everything that matters... is a mystery You may need to show a pause between two sentences within one subtitle. For example where a phone call is taking place and we can only witness one side of it there may not be time to split the sentences into separate subtitles to show that someone we cant see or hear is responding. In this case you should put two dots immediately before the second sentence. How are you.. Oh Im glad to hear that. A very effective technique is to use cumulative subtitles where the first part appears before the second and both remain on screen until the next subtitle. Use this method only when the content justifies it standard prepared subtitles should be displayed in blocks. If the speaker simply trails off without completing a sentence put three dots at the end of their speech. If they then start a new sentence no continuation dots are necessary. Hello Mr... Oh sorry Ive forgotten your name If the unfinished sentence is a question or exclamation put three dots not two before the question mark or exclamation mark. What do you think youre... If a speaker is interrupted by another speaker or event put three dots at the end of the incomplete speech. When the hesitation or interruption occurs in the middle of a sentence that is split across two subtitles do the following Where there is no timelapse between the two subtitles put three dots at the end of the first subtitle but no dots in the second one. I think... I would like to leave now. Where there is a timelapse between the two subtitles put three dots at the end of the first subtitle and two dots at the beginning of the second so that it is clear that it is a continuation. Id like..... a piece of chocolate cake Remember that dots are only used to indicate a pause or an unfinished sentence. You do not need to use dots every time you split a sentence across two or more subtitles. In humorous sequences it is important to retain as much of the humour as possible. This will affect the editing process as well as when to leave the screen clear. Try wherever possible to keep punchlines separate from the preceding text. Where possible allow viewers to see actions and facial expressions which are part of the humour by leaving the screen clear or by editing. Try not to leave a subtitle on screen when the next shot contains no speech and shows the characters reaction as this distracts from the reaction and spoils the punchline. Never edit characters catchphrases. All music that is part of the action or significant to the plot must be indicated in some way. If it is part of the action e. g. somebody playing an instrumenta record playingmusic on a jukebox or radio then write the label in upper case SHE WHISTLES A JOLLY TUNE POP MUSIC ON RADIO MILITARY BAND PLAYS SWEDISH NATIONAL ANTHEM If the music is incidental music i. e. not part of the action and well known or identifiable in some way the label begins MUSIC followed by the name of the music music titles should be fully researched. MUSIC is in caps to indicate a label but the words following it are in upper and lower case as these labels are often fairly long and a large amount of text in upper case is hard to read. MUSIC The Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy by Tchaikovsky MUSIC God Save The Queen MUSIC A waltz by Victor Herbert MUSIC The Swedish National Anthem The Swedish National Anthem does not have quotation marks around it as it is not the official title of the music. Sometimes a combination of these two styles will be appropriate HE HUMS God Save The Queen SHE WHISTLES The Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy by Tchaikovsky If the music is incidental music but is an unknown piece written purely to add atmosphere or dramatic effect do not label it. However if the music is not part of the action but is crucial for the viewers understanding of the plot a soundeffect label should be used EERIE MUSIC Song lyrics are almost always subtitled whether they are part of the action or not. Every song subtitle starts with a white hash mark and the final song subtitle has a hash mark at the start and the end These foolish things remind me of you There are two exceptions In cases where you consider the visual information on the screen to be more important than the song lyrics leave the screen free of subtitles. Where snippets of a song are interspersed with any kind of speech and it would be confusing to subtitle both the lyrics and the speech it is better to put up a music label and to leave the lyrics unsubtitled. online Instead of the symbol may be used. Song lyrics should generally be verbatim particularly in the case of wellknown songs such as God Save The Queen which should never be edited. This means that the timing of song lyric subtitles will not always follow the conventional timings for speech subtitles and the subtitles may sometimes be considerably faster. If however you are subtitling an unknown song specially written for the content and containing lyrics that are essential to the plot or humour of the piece there are a number of options edit the lyrics to give viewers more time to read them combine songlines wherever possible do a mixture of both edit and combine songlines. NB If you do have to edit make sure that you leave any rhymes intact. Song lyric subtitles should be kept closely in sync with the soundtrack. For instance if it takes 15 seconds to sing one line of a hymn your subtitle should be on the screen for 15 seconds. Song subtitles should also reflect as closely as possible the rhythm and pace of a performance particularly when this is the focus of the editorial proposition. This will mean that the subtitles could be much faster or slower than the conventional timings. There will be times where the focus of the content will be on the lyrics of the song rather than on its rhythm for example a humorous song like Ernie by Benny Hill. In such cases give the reader time to read the lyrics by combining songlines wherever possible. If the song is unknown you could also edit the lyrics but famous songs like Ernie must not be edited. Where shots are not timed to songlines you should either take the subtitle to the end of the shot if its only a few frames away or end the subtitle before the end of the shot if its 12 frames or more away. All songlines should be centred on the screen. It is generally simpler to keep punctuation in songs to a minimum with punctuation only within lines when it is grammatically necessary and not at the end of lines except for question marks. You should though avoid full stops in the middle of otherwise unpunctuated lines. For example Turn to wisdom. Turn to joy Theres no wisdom to destroy Could be changed to Turn to wisdom turn to joy Theres no wisdom to destroy In formal songs however e. g. opera and hymns where it could be easier to determine the correct punctuation it is more appropriate to punctuate throughout. The last song subtitle should end with a full stop unless the song continues in the background. If the subtitles for a song dont start from its first line show this by using two continuation dots at the beginning.. Now I need a place to hide away Oh I believe in yesterday. Similarly if the song subtitles do not finish at the end of the song put three dots at the end of the line to show that the song continues in the background or is interrupted I hear words I never heard in the Bible... As well as dialogue all editorially significant sound effects must be subtitled. This does not mean that every single creak and gurgle must be covered only those which are crucial for the viewers understanding of the events on screen or which may be needed to convey flavour or atmosphere or enable them to progress in gameplay as well as those which are not obvious from the action. A dog barking in one scene could be entirely trivial in another it could be a vital clue to the storyline. Similarly if a man is clearly sobbing or laughing or if an audience is clearly clapping do not label. Do not put up a soundeffect label for something that can be subtitled. For instance if you can hear what John is saying JOHN SHOUTS ORDERS would not be necessary. Soundeffect labels are not stage directions. They describe sounds not actions GUNFIRE not THEY SHOOT EACH OTHER A sound effect should be typed in white caps. It should sit on a separate line and be placed to the left of the screen unless the sound source is obviously to the right in which case place to the right. Soundeffect labels should be as brief as possible and should have the following structure subject active finite verb FLOORBOARDS CREAK JOHN SHOUTS ORDERS Not CREAKING OF FLOORBOARDS Or FLOORBOARDS CREAKING Or ORDERS ARE SHOUTED BY JOHN If a speaker speaks in a foreign language and invision translation subtitles are given use a label to indicate the language that is being spoken. This should be in white caps ranged left above the invision subtitle followed by a colon. Time the label to coincide with the timing of the first one or two invision subtitles. Bring it in and out with shotchanges if appropriate. If there are a lot of invision subtitles all in the same language you only need one label at the beginning not every time the language is spoken. If the language spoken is difficult to identify you can use a label saying TRANSLATION but only if it is not important to know which language is being spoken. If it is important to know the language and you think the hearing viewer would be able to detect a language change then you must find an appropriate label. The way in which subtitlers convey animal noises depends on the content style. In factual wildlife for instance lions would be labelled LIONS ROAR However in an animation or a game it may be more appropriate to convey animal noises phonetically. For instance LIONS ROAR would become something like Rrrarrgghhh In general the numeral form should be used. However you can spell out numbers when this is editorially justified as detailed below. The numbers 110 are often better spelled out Ill see you in three days Ill see you in 3 days But use the numeral with units It takes 1kJ of energy to lift someone. It takes one kJ of energy to lift someone. Emphatic numbers are always spelled out She gave me hundreds of reasons She gave me 100s of reasons Spell out any number that begins a sentence Three days from now. 3 days from now. If there is more than one number in a sentence or list it may be more appropriate to display them as numerals instead of words On her 21st birthday party 54 guests turned up Consistency is important so avoid the score was three 1 Numerals over 4 digits must include appropriately placed commas There are 1500 cats here. For sports competitions games or quizzes always use numerals to display points scores or timings. For displaying the day of the month use the appropriate numeral followed by lowercase th st or nd April 2nd. Use the numerals plus the sign for all monetary amounts except where the amount is less than 1. 00 We paid 50. For amounts less than 1. 00 the word pence should be used after the numeral 58 pence. If the word pound is used in sentence without referring to a specific amount then the word must be used not the symbol. See the list of supported characters for currency symbols you can use for broadcast and online. broadcast Spell out other currencies including Euro the Euro symbol is not supported in Teletext. online Use the correct Unicode symbol for the currency e. g. the Euro symbol. Indicate the time of the day using numerals in a manner which reflects the spoken language The time now is 430 The alarm went off at 4 oclock Never use symbols for units of measurement. Abbreviations can be used to fit text in a line but if the unit of measurement is the subject do not abbreviate. A cumulative subtitle consists of two or three parts usually complete sentences. Each part will appear on screen at a different time in sync with its speaker but all parts will have an identical outcue. Cumulatives should only be used when there is a good reason to delay part of the subtitle e. g. dramatic impactsong rhythm and no other way of doing it i. e. there is insufficient time available to split the subtitle completely. This is most likely to happen in an interchange between speakers where the first speaker talks much faster than the second. Delaying the speech of the second person by using a cumulative means that the first subtitle will still be on screen long enough to be read while at the same time the speech is kept in sync. Cumulatives are particularly useful in the following situations For jokes to keep punch lines separate In quizzes to separate questions and answers In songs e. g. for backing singers. They are particularly effective when one line starts before the previous one finishes To delay dramatic responses However if a response is not expected a cumulative can give the game away When an exclamationsound effect label occurs just before a shotchange and would otherwise need to be merged with the preceding subtitle To distinguish between two or more white speakers in the same shot Make sure there is sufficient time to read each segment of a cumulative especially the final one. Consider leaving the final part on screen for a slightly longer time to allow the viewer to scan the line again. If you use cumulatives in childrens content observe childrens timings. Be wary of timing the appearance of the secondthird line of a cumulative to coincide with a shotchange as this may cause the viewer to reread the first line. Remember that using a cumulative will often mean that more of the picture is covered. Dont use cumulatives if they will cover mouths or other important visuals Stick to a maximum of three lines unless you are subtitling a fast quiz like University Challenge where it is preferable to show the whole question in one subtitle and where you will not be obscuring any interesting visuals The following guidelines are recommended for the subtitling of programmes targeted at children below the age of 11 years ITC. There should be a match between the voice and subtitles as far as possible. A strategy should be developed where words are omitted rather than changed to reduce the length of sentences. For example Can you think why they do this Why do they do this Can you think of anything you could do with all the heat produced in the incinerator What could you do with the heat from the incinerator Difficult words should also be omitted rather than changed. For example First thing were going to do is make his big ugly badtempered head. First were going to make his big ugly head. All she had was her beloved rat collection. She only had her beloved rat collection. Where possible the grammatical structure should be simplified while maintaining the word order. You can see how metal is recycled if we follow the aluminium. See how metal is recycled by following the aluminium. We need energy so our bodies can grow and stay warm. We need energy to grow and stay warm. Difficult and complex words in an unfamiliar context should remain on screen for as long as possible. Few other words should be used. For example Nurse well test the reflexes again. Nurse well test the reflexes. Air is displaced as water is poured into the bottle. The water in the bottle displaces the air. Care should be taken that simplifying does not change the meaning particularly when meaning is conveyed by the intonation of words. Often the aim of schools programmes is to introduce new vocabulary and to familiarize pupils with complex terminology. When subtitling schools programmes introduce complex vocabulary in very simple sentences and keep it on screen for as long as possible. In general subtitles for children should follow the speed of speech. However there may be occasions when matching the speed of speech will lead to subtitle rate that is not appropriate for the age group. The producerassistant producer should seek advice on the appropriate subtitle timing for a programme. There will be occasions when you will feel the need to go faster or slower than the standard timings the same guidelines apply here as with adult timings see Timing. You should however avoid inconsistent timings e. g. a twoline subtitle of 6 seconds immediately followed by a twoline subtitle of 8 seconds assuming equivalent scores for visual context and complexity of subject matter. More time should be given when there are visuals that are important for following the plot or when there is particularly difficult language. Do not simplify sentences unless the sentence construction is very difficult or sloppy. Avoid splitting sentences across subtitles. Unless this is unavoidable keep to complete clauses. Vocabulary should not be simplified. There should be no extra spaces inserted before punctuation. The subtitler should have a direct prebroadcastencoding feed from the broadcaster so they can hear the output a few seconds earlier than if relying on the broadcast service. Maintain a regular subtitle output with no long gaps unless it is obvious from the picture that there is no commentary even if this means subtitling the picture or providing background information rather than subtitling the commentary. Aim for continuity in subtitles by following through a train of thought where possible rather than sampling the commentary at intervals. Do not subtitle over existing video captions where avoidable in news this is often unavoidable in which case a speakers name can be included in the subtitle if available. Find out specialist vocabulary and specific editorial guidelines for the genre e. g. sport. Familiarise yourself with Prepared segments that have been subtitled and their place in the running order but be prepared for the order to change. When available to the subtitler prerecorded segments should be subtitled prior to broadcast not live and cued out at the appropriate moment. When cueing prepared texts for scripted parts of the programme Try to cue the texts of prerecorded segments so that they closely match the spoken words in terms of start time. Do not cue texts out rapidly to catch up if you get left behind skip some and continue from the correct place. Try to include speakers names if available where invision captions have been obliterated. Subtitles should use upper and lower case as appropriate. Standard spelling and punctuation should be used at all times even on the fastest programmes. Produce complete sentences even for short comments because this makes the result look less staccato and hurried. Strong or inappropriate language must not appear on screen in error. For news programmes current affairs programmes and most other genres subtitles should be verbatim up to a subtitling speed of around 160180wpm. Above that speed some editing would be expected. For some genres such as inplay sporting action the subtitling may be edited more heavily so as to convey vital commentary information while allowing better access to the visuals. BBCSPG Any serious or misleading errors in realtime subtitling should be corrected clearly and promptly. The correction should be preceded by two dashes The minsters shrew is unchanged view. However be aware that too many onair corrections or corrections that are not sufficiently prompt can actually make the subtitles harder for a viewer to follow. Ultimately the subtitler may have to decide whether to make a correction or omit some speech in order to catch up. Sometimes this can be done without detracting from the integrity of the subtitling but this is not always the case. Do not correct minor errors where the reader can reasonably be expected to deduce the intended meaning e. g. typos and misspellings. If necessary an apology should be made at the end of the programme. If possible repeat the subtitle with the error corrected. Live subtitles should appear word by word from left to right to allow maximum reading time. Live subtitles are justified left not centred. Twolines of scrolling text should be used. For live subtitling use a reduced set of formatting techniques. Focus on colour and vertical positioning. A change of speaker should always be indicated by a change of colour. Scrolling subtitles while usually appearing at the bottom of the screen should be raised as appropriate in order to avoid any vital action visual information name labels etc. The format for prepared subtitles depends on the delivery route and platform. In general subtitles for programmes scheduled for linear broadcast including iPlayerfirst are delivered to Playout and to File Based Delivery as STL and EBUTT Part 1 files. Onlineonly content not scheduled for linear broadcast is delivered as EBUTTD files typically for uploading into a BBC content management system. There are some exceptions to this so if in doubt ask your commissioning editor about the correct delivery route and files formats. Note that the above standards support a larger set of characters than is allowed by the BBC. For linear playout all characters for presentation must be in the set in Appendix 1. The file name must follow this pattern UID with slash removed. stl For example Subtitles must conform to the EBU specification TECH 3264E. However the BBC requires certain values in particular elements of the General Subtitle Information Block. See the table below. The Time Code Out TCO values in STL files are inclusive of the last frame in other words the subtitle shall be visible on the frame indicated in the TCO value but not on subsequent frames. This differs from the end time expressions in EBUTT and TTML which are exclusive. For example in an STL file a subtitle with a TCO of 10101020 would map in an EBUTT document to an end attribute value of 10101021. It is common practice to place metadata programme ID name etc. in a subtitle at the beginning of the file. This first subtitle is typically known as subtitle zero and is used for example to check that the correct subtitles have been loaded during preroll. A subtitle zero is not intended to be broadcast and this is achieved by setting the incue and outcue times for this subtitle earlier than the first timecode value that occurs in the corresponding media for example setting subtitle zero to display between 000000 and 000002 when the programme starts at 100000. Subtitle Zero is optional but common in legacy STL files. When an STL file is embedded in an EBUTT document the subtitle zero must be handled as detailed below EBUTT is the BBCs strategic file format for capturing subtitles and associated metadata. The BBC needs to continue to operate systems that use older formats such as Teletext in cases where those legacy systems impose constraints those constraints are incorporated into these guidelines. In the future as legacy systems are phased out the constrained requirements will be relaxed. Where we have control over the distribution and presentation chain those constraints are already removed for example the requirements for EBUTTD delivery for online distribution allow greater flexibility in how to achieve the presentation requirements. Teletext and STL constraints Teletext is still used on some platforms to carry andor display subtitles the BBC expects EBUTT files that preserve some aspects of this technology or that have been converted from STL files. For example Teletext uses a fixed grid of 40x24 cells that for BBC use must be preserved in EBUTT files authored for linear broadcast ttpcellResolution40 24 even though EBUTT does not require use of this specific grid. Subtitles authored for nonlinear platforms are already free of these constraints. For example EBUTTD files for online distribution can use the default cell resolution of 32x15 see EBUTTD cell resolution. When present the STL files must be embedded in an EBUTT document. See below for further details. Embedded STL files may be omitted if the subtitles are created live and then captured. Avoid pixel units Although EBUTT allows pixel length units the BBC requires that only percent or cell units are used. Pixel length values are sometimes misunderstood in the context of video resolutions. It is less confusing to avoid use of pixel units when authoring resolutionindependent content. It is also simpler to transform EBUTT Part 1 into EBUTTD if pixel units are not used since no calculations need to be made relating pixel values to the ttsextent attribute of the tttt element. EBUTT Part 1 Versions The BBC currently uses version 1. 0 of EBUTT but intends to move to version 1. 1. Significant changes were made to the metadata structure between the versions with some elements moved from the BBC to the EBU namespace. Both versions are given here but only v1. 0 specifications are stable. Delivery of v1. 1 files must be approved in advance and the specification confirmed. The file name has this format ebuttmdocumentIdentifierpreRecorded. xml See the rules for constructing ebuttmdocumentIdentifier below. The file must be UTF8 encoded. The file must not begin with a byte order mark BOM. The following table lists standard EBUTT elements and their required values. The below table lists the required document metadata values for BBC subtitle documents based on EBUTT Part 1 v1. 0 which is the current actively used format. The document identifier is obtained by reading the string from the embedded STLs GSI Reference Code field On Air UID and then deleting any spaces and character. This string is appended with a hyphen and the value of the Revision Number field in the STLs GSI block. BBC specifications based on version 1. 2 of EBUTT Part 1 and on the EBUTT Part M Metadata specification are still in development. Information in this section is therefore subject to change. The table below lists the required document metadata values for BBC subtitle documents based on the EBUTT Part M Metadata specification which is not yet in active use by the BBC. This section lists the required extended BBC metadata values for BBC subtitle documents based on EBUTT Part 1 v1. 0 which is the current actively used format. In addition to the standard EBUTT elements listed above the BBC requires the below metadata elements within a bbcttmetadata element. The bbcttmetadata element is the last child of ttmetadata. See Appendix 2 for a sample XML and Appendix 3 for the XSD. In the following tables prefixes are used as shortcuts for the following namespaces BBC specifications for version 1. 2 of EBUTT Part 1 and EBUTT Part M are still in development and are not yet in active use. Information in this section is therefore subject to change. This section lists the required extended BBC metadata values for BBC subtitle documents based on EBUTT Part M. Some metadata that the BBC requires in version 1. 0 of EBUTT Part 1 were incorporated into version 1. 1 and then transferred into EBUTT Part M which is incorporated by reference into EBUTT Part 1 v1. 2 meaning that BBCspecific elements in the bbctt namespace can be replaced by elements in the standard EBUTT namespace ebuttm. The following table summarises the changes These are the BBC metadata required for EBUTT v1. 1 or later. The STL files if present must be embedded within the EBUTT file within the element ebuttmbinaryData online The file must conform to both EBUTTD 1. 0. 1 and IMSC 1. 0. 1 Text Profile standards. Subtitles must be relative to a programme begin time of 000000. 000. The timebase must be set to media. To allow the file to be played on as many devices as possible the EBUTTD must also conform to the IMSC 1. 0. 1 Text Profile a closely related profile of TTML. In general a valid EBUTTD document that conforms to these Guidelines will also conform to IMSC 1. 0. 1 provided that It uses UTF8 encoding No more than 4 regions are active at the same timeany number of regions can be defined in the document but no more than four can be used simultaneously. The metadata element ebuttmconformsToStandardis included with the value that corresponds to IMSC 1. 0. 1 as well as the value that corresponds to EBUTTD 1. 0. 1 ebuttmconformsToStandardhttpwww. w3. orgnsttmlprofileimsc1textebuttmconformsToStandard ebuttmconformsToStandardurnebuttdistribution201804ebuttmconformsToStandard IMSC 1. 0. 1 also imposes complexity contraints however these are not likely to be exceeded if you follow these guidelines. online For scheduled programmes with an On Air UID the file must be named UID with slash removed. ebuttd. xml. Contact the commissioning editor for guidance on file names for for nonscheduled content where no UID exists. Note that embedded STL files should not be included within EBUTTD documents. The file must be UTF8 encoded. The file must not begin with a byte order mark BOM. There is no standard specification stating where the Teletext rendering area is located over video. Teletext was created when televisions had a 43 aspect ratio so it is reasonable to assume that the Teletext rendering area was intended also to be 43. However most implementations avoid the edges of the screen because televisions typically overscanned which meant that the edges were not visible to the viewer. As a rough basis then positioning a 43 area in the central 90 vertically is a good starting point to keep the subtitles within the safe area. Such an area within a 169 aspect ratio video would have a horizontal width of 67. 5 of that root container region. However whereas Teletext was designed to be displayed using a monospaced font modern systems typically use a proportionally spaced font. For double height text as was traditionally used for subtitles the Teletext approach was simply to create glyphs twice as tall without modifying the width. Adopting the same approach today with proportionally spaced fonts is likely to result in text that is unpleasant to look at and hard to read it would have to be a highly condensed variant of the font. Instead we need to find a balance between font size and line width that presents the text at a readable size while minimising the chance of unwanted line breaks in case the rendered text does not fit within the allocated space. Therefore the width available is extended to 75 of the 169 video area with any additional space needed to accommodate line padding added on either side. Teletext specifies lines in the range 023 however no subtitles may be placed on line 0. Double height lines in Teletext occupy the line on which they are specified and the following line. Therefore there are 23 addressable single height lines and 22 addressable double height lines. The top edge of text specified on line 1 must be positioned at 5 from the top of the root container region. The bottom edge of text specified on line 23 single height or line 23 double height must be positioned at 95 from the top of the root container region. The following diagram illustrates this in visual form. Note that the underlying grid is virtual and that elements dont necessarily align to it. See ttpcellResolution. Teletext subtitle lines begin with at least 3 or 4 spacing control characters which set the box colour and the text colour if not white. Lines do not need to end with control characters but may do so if the text does not run to the end of the line. Therefore there are a maximum of 37 characters per line occupying positions 339 inclusive zeroindexed. The left edge of a character at position 3 must be positioned no less than 12. 5 from the left of the root container region. The right edge of a character at position 39 must be positioned no more than 87. 5 from the left of the root container region. Since Teletext does not signal any authorial intent behind the positioning of text implementations may need to make inferences about how to align groups of more than one adjacent line that are visible at the same time. The algorithms for making those inferences may include contentbased preferences and analysis of sequences of subtitles as they change over time for example. Groups of lines may each be considered as being aligned horizontally to their centre position if they are within a character of that position. For example if three adjacent lines have respective centre points at positions 20. 5 21 and 21. 5 a heuristic may consider them all to be centered about position 21. Lines that are aligned to a left or right position should have the same position for their first or last character respectively. In some cases it may be that more than one possible alignment exists. For example those same three adjacent lines could all have the same left position. If there is any other indication of authorial intent available then that should be honoured where possible. For example within a sequence of leftaligned subtitles a single centered subtitle looks strange and is unlikely to have been intended. Conversely within a sequence of centered subtitles a single leftaligned subtitle looks odd. When subtitles are cumulative centered subtitles should not be preferred because the change in position when words are added to a line makes the text difficult to read. Such adjacent lines should be placed within the same ttp element and separated by ttbr elements. The style applied to the ttp element should include a ttstextAlign attribute set to the value corresponding to their alignment edge or centre. Those ttp elements should be placed within regions positioned to apply the equivalent horizontal and vertical areas and whose ttsdisplayAlign attribute is set to an appropriate value depending on the position in the root container region. For example regions at the top should be before edge aligned and those at the bottom should be after edge aligned. Regions in the central vertical area may be center aligned. Whereas Teletext is a monospaced system typically the resulting subtitles will be presented using a proportionally spaced font. When the text is rendered it may occupy more width than the original Teletext. To allow for this where all the text in a ttregion has the same value of ttstextAlign the left and right edges of the region should be extended such that the text is in the same position up to the limits specified above. This reduces the chance of unexpected line breaks. Why is this important Applying these rules should allow any text size customisation to retain appropriate relative positioning of each line without introducing gaps between lines for example. broadcast Prepared subtitles for linear programmes must use the SMPTE timebase with a start of programme aligned to the source media. This is usually but not always 10000000. See the BBCs Technical requirements for delivery as AS11 DPP files. online Prepared subtitles for online exclusives must be relative to a programme begin time of 000000. 000. This section contains detailed instruction for developers of subtitle authoring tools that output EBUTT or EBUTTD documents and for processors of those files. It is structured around the key TTML elements and attributes see the example document below and click on elements and attributes to go to their respective section. This is intended to be a developerfriendly view of the specifications but not to replace them. However where BBCspecific constraints exist they are described in relation to the subtitle guidelines that they support. The specifications remain authoritative and they should be consulted alongside this document Because closed subtitles are processed from file it is possible for a presentation processor e. g. a settop box or a browser to override the instructions in the subtitles file. Generally the processor should respect the authors intentions. However where requirements exist that are specific for the authoring or processing of subtitle documents they are listed separately under the relevant XML element. Note that in the spirit of an iterative process there may be further releases making improvements to the developer guidance. In particular the focus here is on EBUTTD creation for online only subtitle delivery where there is commonality with EBUTT Part 1 delivery for archive and downstream conversion to a distribution format this is described however we do not expect that all existing EBUTT Part 1 delivery requirements are captured here. TTML is a markup language based on XML using structural elements like in HTML head body div p and span in the TTML namespace shown in this document with the tt prefix with styling semantics taken from XSLFO and timing semantics taken from SMIL. EBUTT and EBUTTD are subsets of TTML with a couple of extensions. Styling and layout are applicative in other words styling and positional information are defined and identified and content specifies the styles and positioning by referencing those identified style and regions. The top level tttt element carries parameters needed for presenting the content. The tthead element carries styling layout and document level metadata. The ttbody element carries the timed content that is to be presented in a ttdiv ttp and ttspan ttbr hierarchy. Content elements can be timed using begin and end attributes. The following example illustrates this structure. This example can also be downloaded here. xml version1. 0 encodingUTF8 tt xmlnshttpwww. w3. orgnsttml xmlnsttphttpwww. w3. orgnsttmlparameter xmlnsttshttpwww. w3. orgnsttmlstyling xmlnsebuttsurnebuttstyle xmlnsebuttmurnebutturnebuttmetadata ttptimeBasemedia ttpcellResolution32 15 xmllangen head metadata ebuttmdocumentMetadata ebuttmconformsToStandardurnebuttdistribution201804ebuttmconformsToStandard ebuttmconformsToStandardhttpwww. w3. orgnsttmlprofileimsc1textebuttmconformsToStandard ebuttmdocumentMetadata metadata The styling element defines the styles that will be applied to p and span tags.

Here a top and a bottom regions are defined with a clearance of 2 lines of text from the top and bottom. With a cell resolution of 32 by 15 a font height of 100 of cell height equals 6. 66 10015. A line height of 120 of the font size equals 8 of the height of the active video 1. 2 x 6. 66. Each region accommodates 3 lines of text 3 x 8 24 which sets the regions height. The width of the regions is set at 71. 25 to take into account any potential centre cut of 169 video on 43 displays. The amount of text that can fit within one line is restricted by its size and also by the required application of 1c of line padding 2 x 0. 5c. This width has been calculated also to accommodate the maximum 38 characters that can be practically put on a Teletext line at this font size where the font is not unusually wide. layout region xmlidtopRegion ttsorigin14. 375 16 ttsextent71. 25 24 ttsdisplayAlignbefore ttswritingModelrtb ttsoverflowvisible region xmlidbottomRegion ttsorigin14. 375 60 ttsextent71. 25 24 ttsdisplayAlignafter ttswritingModelrtb ttsoverflowvisible layout head body The intended use of DIVs is to hold semantic information for example sections within a programme.

See Annex E of EBUTTD specification. BBCspecific requirements apply. Description Expresses a virtual 2 dimensional grid of cells. The first value defines the number of columns and the second value defines the number of rows. The cell height c unit is used as the basis for calculating font size and therefore indirectly line height. For example the default value 32 15 creates a cell with height 6. 66 10015 and width 3. 125 10032 of the root container regions height and width. The root container region is defined as the active video area in EBUTT but implementation defined in EBUTTD. Font size percentages are relative to the parent elements font size or if none is set the cell height. For example a font size of 100 set on an element with no ancestor that sets font size would be computed as 115 6. 66 of the root container region height a line height of 120 applied to that would be 120 of the font size i. e. 1. 2 115 8. EBUTT 1. 0 If the cell measurement unit is used e. g. as part of a ttsfontSize attribute value then the ttpcellResolution attribute must be specified. Document Requirements Shallrequirement EBUTT 1. 0Set the cell resolution explicitly even if using the default value. Example tttt ttpcellResolution32 15... Processor Requirements Shallrequirement The calculated font size must fit within a line height of between 7 and 9 of the active video height. See Section 10. 2 Font size Description Describes the area within the root container region that contains subtitles i. e. the area that needs to be minimally visible to the viewer. This area typically fully contains all of the referenced regions within the Document Instance. The active area may be used by a player to ensure that the subtitles remain in the visible area of the screen if the player area is not the same shape as the video image for example. Document Requirements Shouldrequirement EBUTTDSpecify the active area. tttt... ittpactiveArea12 5 76 90... Processor Requirements Shouldrequirement The visible area of the video must include the specified active area occupied by subtitles. In normal conditions the registration or positional alignment of the subtitle rendering area against the video image must not be modified to achieve this. The exception would be if the subtitle rendering area is adjusted temporarily for example to accommodate controls. Description Sets a generic or a named font family. This attribute can contain a prioritised list of font names which are typically processed in order until a match is found thus allowing predictable fallbacks to be used. This list may be evaluated on a per glyph basis to deal with the case where most glyphs are present in a font but later fonts include specific required glyphs omitted from earlier fonts for example.

Roboto in Android. Example ttstyle xmlids0 ttsfontFamilyReithSans Arial Roboto proportionalSansSerif default... Processor Requirements Shallrequirement Map a generic font family name to the best appropriate matching font on the device. Shallrequirement Use downloadable fonts if available. Shallrequirement Fall back to the system defined sans serif font if a downloadable font is not available. Prefer proportional fonts if there is a choice. BBCspecific requirements apply. Description EBUTT 1. 0 Sets the font size using percent pixel or cell values. Double values can be used to set height and width separately known as anamorphic font sizing this scales the font by different amounts horizontally and vertically. EBUTTD Sets the font size using a percentage of cell height value see cell resolution. A single value only can be used. Percentage values are relative to the parent elements font size or the cell size when the parent element and every ancestor has no specified font size. Document Requirements Shouldrequirement For BBC subtitles set the font size to be approximately 115th 6. 667 of the height of the root container for example by setting ttpcellResolutionto 32 15and ttsfontSizeto 100.

Shouldrequirement Apply a scaling factor based on the devices physical screen size see Presentation font size. Example For a 32 TV and an authored font size corresponding to the authored font size guideline apply a scaling factor of 0. 67 so that the computed font size is as though the font size was specified at 67 of cell height. Shallrequirement Apply scaling factors cumulatively. Example A player supports Reith Sans and the subtitle document specifies that Reith Sans is to be used. The subtitle document specifies a line height of 120 so a scaling factor of 0. 9 needs to be applied. The processor also needs to apply a scaling factor of 0. 67 for display on a 32 TV. The actual scaling factor to be applied is 0. 9 0. 67 0. 6. Description Sets interbaseline separation between line areas. Note that there is no uniform implementation of the value normal by CSSbased rendering processors. Additionally different browsers render different line heights for the same font and size. This contributes to a known issue where a gap appears between lines of text. See also ittsfillLineGap. The example below illustrates this different fonts of the same size were used with a line height set to normal. Processors should render as on the right example without a gap between the lines Document Requirements Shouldrequirement Set the line height explicitly on a style applied to a pelement using percentage values evaluated relative to the computed font size. Example ttstyle xmlidparagraphStyle ttslineHeight120...... ttp xmlidp123 styleparagraphStyle... ttp Shouldrequirement Set ttslineHeight120to accommodate commonly used web fonts.

Description Alignment of inline areas in a containing block. The alignment values start and end depend on the value of the writing mode which in turn depends on the Unicode bidi mode and the style attributes ttsunicodeBidi ttsdirection and ttswritingMode applied to the element.

Shallrequirement Align the line areas generated by a ttpelement after applying any line padding for example if there is 0. 5cof line padding applied to each line area and 1cof start and end padding on the region then the first glyph of a left aligned line area will be 1. 5cto the right of the region origins x coordinate. EBUTTD only. Description In EBUTTD only defines whether automatic line wrapping applies within an element. If the value is wrap automated linebreaking occurs if the line overflows the region. If the value is noWrap no automated linebreaking occurs and overflow is treated in accordance with the value of ttsoverflow attribute of the corresponding region. Note that if ttswrapOption is set to noWrap the region that corresponds to the affected content should have the attribute ttsoverflow set to visible so that any overflowing text remains visible. Although the default value is wrap it is better to have the subtitler rather than the software control line breaks by inserting ttbr. Subtitlers and authoring software are expected to manage the width of text on each line so that the text does not overflow. There is no constraint on adding manual breaks regardless of the value of ttswrapOption. Document Requirements Shouldrequirement Disable automatic line wrapping so that the editor creates line break manually. Shallrequirement EBUTT 1. 0For EBUTT 1. 0 do not include this attribute. Shouldrequirement If ttswrapOptionis set to noWrap set the attribute ttsoverflowto visibleon the region that corresponds to the affected content. Shouldrequirement When deriving break points use the UAX14 line breaking algorithm. Processor Requirements Shouldrequirement Use the UAX14 line breaking algorithm. Note that when the document has ttswrapOptionnoWrapthe line breaking algorithm will not apply. Shallrequirement If the text overflows its region attempt to display the overflow even if ugly so that viewers who depend on subtitles dont miss important information. Shallrequirement EBUTT 1. 0For EBUTT processing this attribute should be ignored and manual line breaks used instead. See page 33 of the specification Description Defines how multiple rows of inline areas are aligned relative to each other within a containing block area. This attribute acts as a modifier to the action defined by the ttstextAlign attribute value whether that value is explicitly or implicitly specified. This attribute effectively creates additional alignment points for multiple rows of text thus it has no effect if only a single row of text is present. ebuttsmultiRowAlign modifies the behaviour of ttstextAlign so that rather than each line generated by the ttp being aligned relative to the region each line in the group can be leftcentreright aligned relative to the longest line and the group of lines is then aligned according to ttstextAlign. See the references for more detail on this. Processor Requirements Shallrequirement If the ebuttsmultiRowAlignattribute as specified on a ttpelement has the same value as ttstextAlignor is set to auto each generated line area in the ttpshall be aligned according to the computed value of ttstextAlign.

BBCspecific requirements apply. Description In EBUTTD only adds padding on the start and end edges of each rendered line. Background color applies to the line area including the padding. Application of padding affects the layout of text for example by reducing the maximum width available in which to render text on a single line see line length and region definition. Note this attribute is different from ttspadding which applies space to a region and in TTML2 to other content elements. Must be applied to ttp only. Document Requirements Shallrequirement EBUTTDFor EBUTTD set line padding to approximately half a character width. This should be calculated from the aspect ratio the grid and the font size. For the purposes of the calculation 1em can be assumed to be equal to the font size. The following example calculation uses nonrecommended values for illustration purposes only. Assuming an aspect ratio of 169 a cellResolution of 32 15 and a font size of 80 font height 5. 33 of video height 80 x 100 15 font width also 1em expressed as a fraction of the width of the root container region 2. 99 5. 33 x 9 16 0. 5em 1. 495 2. 99 2 Expressed in cells 0. 47 32 1. 495 100 ebuttslinePadding0. 47c Processor Requirements Shouldrequirement If no line padding exists and there is sufficient space available add 0. 5c of padding on the sides of each line. Note that the recommended behaviour for ttsoverflowis that it is visibleand that ttswrapOptionis noWrap. Shallrequirement When laying out line areas inset the line areas by twice the value of ebuttslinePaddingfrom the start and end edges of the region after having applied any ttspaddingvalues. Shouldrequirement If scaling down the font size also reduce the line padding.

Setting the width of a region to 71. 25 with zero padding should be sufficient to carry all 38 possible characters across a Teletext line and add 0. 5c line padding. A region of such a size should be centred horizontally i. e. have an origin x coordinate of 14. 375 to allow for it to be displayed in its entirety even if a centre cut out is used to display the central 43 area of a 169 root container region. Example ttregion xmlidr0 ttsdisplayAlignafter ttsextent68. 5 7. 826 ttsorigin12 87. 174 ttsoverflowvisible Document Requirements Shallrequirement Documents must not contain overlapping regions that are active at the same time where a region is active if any content that is flowed into it is active. Shallrequirement The regions origin x coordinate must be greater than or equal to 12. 5 of the root container region for a 169 active video this allows for a 43 centre cut. Shallrequirement The sum of the regions origin x coordinate and extent width must be less than or equal to 87. 5 of the root container region for a 169 active video this allows for a 43 centre cut. Shallrequirement The number of regions active at any one time must not exceed 4 IMSC 1 requirement. Processor Requirements Shouldrequirement Support at least eight regions that are active at the same time. Shallrequirement Support at least four regions that are active at the same time. Shouldrequirement If overlapping regions are active simultaneously draw them in region definition order i. e. the order of regions in the layoutelement. Note that this is not permitted in EBUTT and EBUTTD documents. Description The x and y coordinates of the top left corner of a region with respect to the root container region which is the active video for EBUTT 1. 0 and some implementation dependent rendering plane for EBUTTD but generally expected to match the displayed video. Presentation implementations are expected to map these to device pixels for optimum display of text. Example with ttsorigin20 80 the top left corner of the region is 20 of the root container region width from the left and 80 of the root container region height from the top. Document Requirements Shallrequirement The sum of the value for the xcoordinate of the region and the value for the width of the region specified by ttsextent must be less than or equal to 100. Shallrequirement The sum of the value for the ycoordinate of the region and the value for the height of the region specified by ttsextent must be less or equal to 100. Description This attribute can be specified on either ttregion or tttt elements. It sets the width and height of the region area being either the root container region when specified on the tttt element or a defined region within that when specified on a ttregion element. Note that where pixel coordinates are used they are logical coordinates in the TTML space only and do not need to match actual encoded video or device pixels. EBUTTD Only percentage values are allowed. EBUTTD ttsextent is only permitted on region elements. EBUTT 1. 0 Only length expressions in pixels are allowed on ttsextent when specified on the tt element. EBUTT 1. 0 If pixel length expressions are used anywhere in a document then ttsextent must be present on the tt element. EBUTT 1. 0 Percentage and pixel values are allowed. Document Requirements Shallrequirement The sum of the value for the xcoordinate of the region and the value for the width of the region specified by ttsextent must be less than or equal to 100. Shallrequirement The sum of the value for the ycoordinate of the region and the value for the height of the region specified by ttsextent must be less or equal to 100. Shallrequirement EBUTT 1. 0The ttsextentmust be present on the ttttelement if any length unit in the document is expressed in pixels. Example tttt ttsextent400px 300px Shallrequirement EBUTTD ttsextentmust not be present on any element other than ttregion Shallrequirement EBUTTDEBUTTD document must not express the value of ttsextentin pixel units. Example ttregion xmlidr0 ttsextent68. 5 7. 826... Processor Requirements Shouldrequirement Clip any region that extends beyond the root container region the rectangle corresponding to an origin of 0 0 with an extent 100 100 to the area that intersects with the root container region. Description Alignment in the block progression direction. When block progression direction is toptobottom before would result in top alignment and after would result in bottom alignment. Document Requirements Shallrequirement A ttsdisplayAlignattribute shall be present on every regionelement. ttregion xmlidr0 ttsdisplayAlignafter... Processor Requirements Shallrequirement The active lines within the region are aligned in the block progression direction to the before edge of the region for before usually the top for top to bottom left to right the middle for center or the after edge for after usually the bottom for top to bottom left to right.

Description Defines whether a region area is clipped if the content of the region overflows the specified extent of the region. If the author intends to avoid truncated content the ttsoverflow attribute should always be specified and be set to visible. Note that setting the value to visible does not guarantee that content that overflows the region will be presented for example if it overflows the active video region root container. See also ttswrapOption. Document Requirements Shallrequirement Set overflow to visibleso that subtitles are visible even if they overflow. region xmlidr0 ttsoverflowvisible Description A logical container of subtitle text. Intended to hold semantic information for example sections within a programme. divs may be placed in regions which apply to the div and all its descendants. A div may have style references which are inherited by all of its descendants except where a descendant overrides it with a different style. Begin and end times are not permitted on divs this is a constraint in EBUTT and EBUTTD rather than in TTML. Where divs are used for semantic information it may be specified as metadata using attributes such as ttmrole xmllang etc andor a metadata element. Document Requirements Description Represents a logical paragraph. When reference is made to a subtitle it is most closely analogous to a ttp element in general. Any subtitle text in a ttp must be within a ttspan element so that the background color is correctly applied. Multiple line subtitles should be placed within a single ttp element so that any processor that permits customisation of the size of text can scale and position all the lines together as a group rather than each line separately when lines are in separate ttp elements this can lead to gaps or alignment errors between lines. Timing may be applied to a ttp element using the begin and end attributes or to each span inside the element but in EBUTTD such timing must not be present in both. Cumulative subtitles for example where words are appended at different times should be represented by timed ttspans within a ttp this approach is preferred to a set of differently timed ttp elements each being the same as the previous but with the new word or phrase appended because it is simpler to extract the plain text version when this approach is used. Every ttp is required by EBUTT and EBUTTD to have an xmlid attribute. Where ttps are used for semantic information it may be specified as metadata using attributes such as ttmrole xmllang etc andor a metadata element. Document Requirements Shallrequirement Subtitle text character content must not be outside a ttspanelement. Example ttp xmlidsubtitle1 regiontop begin000030. 000 end000031. 000 styleparagraphStyle ttspan stylespanStyle This subtitle is in the top region ttspan ttp Shallrequirement Each ttpelement must have an xmlidattribute value that is unique in the document. Example ttp xmlids2874 regiontop begin000030. 000 end000031. 000 styleparagraphStyle ttspan stylespanStyle This subtitle is in the top region ttspan ttp Processor Requirements Shallrequirement Do not infer subtitle sequence from xmlid. BBCspecific requirements apply. Description Used to apply style information to the enclosed textual content. This style information is added to or overwrites style information from the currently active context. Background colour must be applied to this element rather than ttp or ttdiv so that the background is applied to the text area. For cumulative subtitles set begin and end time on parts of a subtitle using ttspan see example. EBUTT 1. 0 May include nested ttspan. EBUTTD Must not include nested ttspan. Document Requirements Shallrequirement All subtitle text must be wrapped in a ttspanwith a black background style applied. Example ttstyle xmlidspanStyle ttswrapOptionnoWrap ebuttslinePadding0. 5c ttsfontFamilyproportionalSansSerif ttsfontSize100 ttsbackgroundColor000000... ttp ttspan stylespanStyle begin000130 end000135 This subtitle is displayed for 5 seconds. ttspan ttspan stylespanStyle begin00. 01. 33 end000135 This one is added after 3 and remains on screen for 2. ttspan ttp Processor Requirements Shouldrequirement For every ttspanwith background applied make the background height equal to the calculated line height regardless of other specifications. This is to help ensure no gap exists between lines. STL files must use characters in code table 00 Latin alphabet within TTI blocks. Reproduced from EBU TECH. 3264E. Teletext output must signal and use the Latin G0 character set with English National option subset as defined in ETS 300 706. Note that some mapping is required between the STL and Teletext character sets. This is an example of a prepared subtitle file. This is not a complete file multiple instances of elements have been removed and long values shortened. Not all possible elements are included for example elements required for live subtitles are not included. Sample file EBUTT v1. 0 preprepared Sample file raw XML ABCD123A021preRecorded. xml When this sample EBUTT file is converted for distribution as EBUTTD and IMSC 1 Text Profile it generates the following output Sample file EBUTTD and IMSC 1 Text Profile distribution subtitle document. Sample file raw XML ABCD123A021preRecorded. ebuttd. xml This is the XSD for the BBC metadata section of the EBUTT document. It includes elements for audio description and signslanguage documents that can be omitted for subtitle files. To validate the document fully an EBUTT schema should also be used. Sample file XML Schema Definition for BBC EBUTT metadata This section provides a stepbystep guide for making an EBUTTD file using a template for online distribution only. These instructions assume no prior knowledge and if followed closely will produce a valid but minimal file. You can then use this file as a basis for additional styling such elements such as colour. Note that these instructions are for creating a barebones file that does not include many of the features required by the BBC. All subtitles will appear in white text on a black background and centred at the bottom of the screen. This minimal formatting excludes features like colour to identify speakers positioning to avoid obscuring important information and cumulative subtitles. You should therefore check with the commissioning editor that this minimal file is suitable. This is important Do not follow these instructions if you need to deliver subtitles for broadcast or if the presentation requires more than simple whiteonblack text centred at the bottom of the screen. Consult the rest of this Guidelines document for these cases. Prepare the text. If available begin with a transcript file so you dont have to type in the text. Add labels if required e. g. to describe action. Add line breaks and timings. This is commonly done with an authoring tool. Ideally the tool should allow you to configure all of the features that determine line length line padding region definition cell resolution font family and font size. This will allow you to preview the subtitles as reliably as possible the final appearance will be determined by the users system. If your tool does not support these features use a WYSIWYG tool to define a subtitle region of 71. 25 of the width of the video for a 169 video. Use a wide font such as Verdana to minimise the risk of text overflowing the region when rendered in the final display font. It is not recommended to control line length using a character count limit only this is a crude method that does not take into account the width of individual letters and fonts. Although 37 characters would fit most of the time in some cases they might not e. g. too many Ms and Ws. If you use this method you should test your subtitles in different browsers and operating systems before delivery. If you dont have access to an authoring tool you can use a simple text editor although this method is slow and errorprone. Create a paragraph with manual line breaks for each subtitle and add timings for each paragraph. In this case you can only control line length by counting characters per line and you should test your file thoroughly on different browsers and systems before delivery. Timings must be relative to a programme begin time of 000000. 000 Save or export the subtitles as a simple text file. The file should include nothing but the subtitle text with line breaks and timings. Format timings. Timings must be in the format HHMMSS followed by a fraction e. g. 000129. 265. In EBUTTD the begintime of the subtitle is inclusive but the endtime is exclusive. This means that if you want one subtitle to follow another without any gaps you should set the endtime of the first subtitle to be the same as the begintime of the following subtitle. Format lines. Ensure that lines are not too long and that a ttbrtag is present for every line break within a subtitle. Remove unnecessary line breaks and white space at the beginning or end of a subtitle. Escape characters. Replace special characters with their escaped version as detailed in Encoding characters. Create the span elements. Wrap each subtitle in a ttspanelement with a styleattribute so you have a list of subtitles like this ttspan stylespanStyleFirst linettbrsecond linettspan ttspan stylespanStyleThis subtitle has one linettspan ttspan stylespanStyleNext subtitle... ttspan Create the paragraph elements. Wrap each of the spans in a ttpelement. Each must have begin and end times and an identifier which must begin with a letter. In this minimal example regionand styleattributes are fixed for all subtitles so they are set in the container div. The identifier must be unique for each subtitle. For the begin and end times use the timings youve prepared. You will end up with something like this ttp xmlidsubtitle1 begin000010. 000 end000020. 000 ttspan stylespanStyleFirst linettbrsecond linettspan ttp ttp xmlidsubtitle2 begin000020. 000 end000020. 748 ttspan stylespanStyleThis subtitle has one linettspan ttp ttp xmlidsubtitle3 begin000021. 12 end000021. 54 ttspan stylespanStyleNext subtitle... ttspan ttp Place the subtitles inside a template. Save a copy of the EBUTTD template and open it with a simple text editor avoid word processors such as Word.

47,Dog starts house fire after turning on hairdryer,"Crews were called to Hockley, Essex, on Christmas Eve and treated the dog and owner at the scene.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-64088063,Dog starts house fire after turning on hairdryer Published A dog is believed to have caused a fire in a house on Christmas Eve after accidentally turning a hairdryer on. Essex Fire Service said crews were called to Hockley Essex following reports of a smokefilled house. Firefighters worked quickly to extinguish the fire after locating it in the bedroom. The dog was waiting by the front door when the homeowner returned and both were treated for smoke inhalation the service said. Watch manager Gary Shinn said The homeowner was out and came back to find her house full of smoke. We believe the fire started because a hairdryer was left plugged in and on a bed. We think the dog may have then jumped on the bed and turned the hairdryer on eventually causing it to catch alight to the bedding and mattress. Once youve finished with any electrical appliances such as hairdryers and straighteners please take a moment to unplug them.,2022-12-24T22:49:40Z
48,Jasmine Harrison reflects on record-breaking 2022 UK swim,"Jasmine Harrison, 23, explains what it was like to spend three months swimming the length of the UK.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-64027453,Jasmine Harrison reflects on recordbreaking 2022 UK swim Published While her friends spent summer 2022 at music festivals and barbecues 23yearold Jasmine Harrison was in a wetsuit swimming 900 miles 1448km up the west coast of the UK. After an arduous 110 days she became the first woman to complete the challenge. BBC News Tom Airey caught up with her to see how she had readjusted to life on land. Thinking back my favourite memories from the swim are when it was flat and calm with the sun setting dolphins rising up beside me Jasmine recalls. Those idyllic scenes were the exception rather than the rule on her epic journey which saw her spending up to 12 hours in the sea each day in all manner of conditions. Jasmine from Thirsk in North Yorkshire also remembers her front crawl through blooms of hundreds of jellyfish and being stung multiple times in the process. She also suffered from salt mouth where skin is stripped from the tongue and throat making it difficult and painful to swallow. Leaving the Isle of Man I was followed by a basking shark it wasnt going to eat me but it was still very scary she says. The fish which typically measures up to about 8m 26ft as an adult is not a threat to humans and lives on a diet of plankton which it eats by opening its huge mouth and filtering water through its gills. I wasnt aware of it at the time when I was in the water but a support kayaker came over and said get on the boat they first thought it might have been a whale but they saw its tail and it was vertical rather than horizontal. From first entering water in western Cornwall on 1 July to reaching the top of Scotland on 18 October her support boat named Crews Control became her home and its rotating 20person volunteer crew her family. The team have been just brilliant every single one was initially a complete stranger she says. While looking for a kayaker I just went on Instagram typed in the relevant hashtags to see who was posting nearby and then asked them if they wanted to kayak for me. Jasmine recently completed a twoandahalf week journey sailing Crews Control back down the UK following the same route she swam months earlier to drop the boat on the south coast to be sold. She says As soon as we docked into Dartmouth the skipper looked at me and said What now It was a massive relief but almost a bit of a depressing feeling its really strange. After heading north to catch up with friends and family in North Yorkshire for Christmas shes refining ideas for her next recordbreaking endeavour. In 2021 she became the youngest woman in the world to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean so now has a yearly pattern of breaking records to keep up. I always want to have a target whether its a physical challenge or an idea for me to work towards I just need something to aim for the swimming teacher says. I want the next challenge to be international maybe pick up a new skill something different. Her latest achievement led to her appearing on several podcasts and talking at the Kendal Mountain Festival with the hope further work as a motivational speaker to inspire others may be on the cards. Jasmine is hoping to be back to full fitness soon after the exhaustion of her swim where she covered distances of up to 27 nautical miles 31 miles50km each day. A couple of weeks ago I did a swim gala just to see what my speed was like in the water but Id not fully recovered I was so tired and hadnt slept she says. When I get back home Ill go back in the pool and see what I can do Ill see what my bodys telling me. As for Crews Control who knows what the boats next adventure will be Shes up for sale in January and well have to wait and see what her next story is says Jasmine. Nothing as exciting as this one.

49,Haldwani: Locals in despair over fears of mass eviction in India,Thousands of people living on disputed land in India's Uttarakhand state say they will become homeless.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64207234,Haldwani Thousands of Indians in despair over mass eviction fears Published Indias top court has temporarily stayed the demolition of over 4000 homes in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand but people are still worried about the fate of their homes which they have spent a lifetime building. BBC Hindis Vineet Khare and Deepak Jasrotia report from Haldwani town. Government officials allege that more than 50000 people most of them Muslims here are living on land that belongs to the Indian Railways. But residents say they have been living in the area for decades and that the railways has no documents to support its claim. In December the state high court asked railway authorities to evict unauthorised occupants after giving them a weeks notice. Residents started getting eviction notices from 1 January. However the Supreme Court on Thursday put a hold on the order saying that thousands cannot be uprooted overnight and that a workable solution must be found. As news of the order reached the residents fear gave way to relief. Residents hugged and congratulated each other happy for the temporary reprieve they had won. But as the date of next hearing for the case on 7 February inches closer the residents find themselves swinging between despair and hope. The BBC spoke to families whose future hangs in the balance. Where will we go For Tilka Devi Kashyap 65 losing her home would mean imminent homelessness for her and her 14 family members. Ms Kashyap arrived in the area in the mid1970s and has invested her lifes earnings to build her house. A onestorey structure with tiny rooms it is home to her sons their wives and children. Ms Kashyap and her family also depend on the area to make a living they sell snacks on a cart outside their house. The small business helps them make just enough money to see each day through. But talks about demolition has been affecting their business she says. Customers have stopped frequenting the area she told the BBC. There are days when we are unable to save anything after buying whats needed for the business and have nothing to cook. Ms Kashyap is among a small number of Hindus living in this predominantly Muslim neighbourhood. She says she was among those who voted for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party BJP to power in the state in 2022. The government should think of the poor she says adding that its the governments responsibility to provide alternate accommodation if their homes are demolished. We voted for the Congress Indias main opposition party earlier. But we got nothing during both the BJP and Congress regimes. Ms Kashyap says that she has been paying taxes and bills on her house for years and wonders why her home is suddenly being termed illegal. The government shouldnt have let us settle here in the first place. Now that we have built everything it wants to bring it our house down. Where will we go she asks. Buying a house in another area isnt an option for Ms Kashyap. Her family has been poor and their financial condition worsened after her husband had an accident five years ago. The accident damaged his limbs and he has been unable to work since then. Costly medical bills of his treatment have hollowed out the familys meagre savings. Ms Kashyap says she does not have the means to relocate or put up a legal fight to save her home but she is determined to do what she can to prove that she and her home belong here. Im going to store all our bills more carefully she says rifling through a stack of crumpled bills that are torn in places. You never know when we might need them to prove our case before a government official. Our life and death depends on this case Zahida who only uses one name sits rolling chapatis wheat flatbread inside her dimlylit tinroofed shack. She shares the space with her children their spouses and her grandchildren. Conditions indoors are cramped and the interiors are worse for wear. But to Zahida whos in her 50s and her family the place is home. It may be in a bad condition but at least we have a home. Where will we go if this is brought down she asks. Zahida says that her ties to the house run deep its where she arrived as a newlywed decades ago raised her kids and where her husband took his last breath. The news that their house could be demolished has come as a blow to her. Like Ms Kashyap the family is struggling financially. A vegetable shop run by her eldest son helps them stay afloat. But the shop is set up in the same disputed locality so losing their house would put an end to their business too she says. We will end up on the streets. I think about this and cry day and night Zahida says. Our life and death depends on this case.,2023-01-10T22:00:38Z
50,Gujarat: Indian man killed over daughter's viral video,The man was allegedly attacked after protesting against a video of his teenage daughter being posted online.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64073466,Gujarat Indian man killed over daughters viral video Published Police in the western Indian state of Gujarat have arrested seven people for allegedly beating a soldier to death. Melaji Vaghela was attacked after he protested against a video of his teenage daughter being posted online according to the police complaint.

52,Another Putin critic died after falling out of a window,"Pavel Antov died after falling from a hotel window in India Sunday, making him the second Vladimir Putin critic to die this way in 2022.",https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-critic-pavel-antov-dies-falling-out-hotel-window-2022-12,Another Putin critic dies after falling out a window A second critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin has died this year after falling from a window. Pavel Antov 65 died Sunday at a hotel in India just days after celebrating his 65th birthday. A second critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died Sunday after falling out of a window the Russian media outlet TASS reported. According to reports Pavel Antov fell from a hotel window in Rayagada India just days after celebrating his 65th birthday. He was visiting the state of Odisha in eastern India. Antov was the chair of the committee on agrarian policy nature management and ecology of the Legislative Assembly of the Vladimir Region and was wellknown in the area according to TASS. Our colleague a successful entrepreneur philanthropist Pavel Antov passed away Vyacheslav Kartukhin the vice speaker of the regional parliament said on his Telegram channel TASS reported. On behalf of the deputies of the United Russia faction I express my deep condolences to relatives and friends. The speaker of the legislative assembly Vladimir Kiselyov called Antovs death a difficult and irreparable loss in a statement on the website of the regional parliament TASS reported. Antov was a known critic of Putin the BBC reported. The BBC reported that a since deleted June WhatsApp message linked to Antovs account and shared after a Russian missile strike in Kyiv Ukraine killed a man and left his wife and 7yearold daughter wounded was seen as critical of Putins war in Ukraine. Its extremely difficult to call all this anything but terror the WhatsApp message said. Antov quickly deflected on social media insisting he was a supporter of the war and Putin adding that the message came from a war critic with whom he did not agree and it was all a misunderstanding the BBC reported.

53,Waterloo Road review – a lesson in how not to revive a TV show,"The BBC has brought back the high-school drama after it became a Covid hit, but its attempts to crowbar heavy social issues into a soapy setting are jarringWaterloo Road (BBC One) was always a show that felt more important for the boxes it ticked and the serv…",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/03/waterloo-road-review-a-lesson-in-how-not-to-revive-a-tv-show,Waterloo Road BBC One was always a show that felt more important for the boxes it ticked and the services it provided than for the quality of its drama. First shown in 2006 the chaotic secondaryschool saga was a breeding ground for new talent Jodie Comer Jenna Coleman and Phoebe Dynevor had early roles in it and one of those continuing dramas that provide work for likable light comedydrama actors who arent cut out for Alist stardom while producing hundreds of episodes to fill schedule space. Such shows especially BBC ones are vulnerable to the whims and politics of broadcasters and to being given the burden of reflecting the issues of the day. Waterloo Road suffered from both malaises. When it was axed in 2015 it felt natural. So why is it back Originally set and filmed in Rochdale Greater Manchester Waterloo Road moved to Greenock in Scotland in 2012 as part of a drive to make more shows outside England. It was an unconvincing rebrand that lasted for three seasons before the show was canned. But there is also a BBC initiative to make more shows outside southeast England so now the Beeb has killed off another soapy workhorse Holby City which may have looked regional because it was set in Bristol but was filmed at Elstree Studios near London and used the money to revive Waterloo Road relocating it in Greater Manchester. What a story But there is a twist in the tale we will get on to the new season in a minute I promise. Waterloo Road has not been hauled randomly out of a dusty filing cabinet. The old episodes were an unexpected hit during Covid lockdowns with the series ending up as BBC iPlayers sixthbiggest show of 2021 generating more streams than Doctor Who Death in Paradise and RuPauls Drag Race UK despite having been off air for six years. A few extra fans then will be pleased to see Angela Griffin as Kim once a teacher and pastoral care specialist at Waterloo Road school now the head of a different comprehensive secondary in the same area this one named after a local historical dignitary who was a slave trader. Episode one scene one shows a black girl spraypainting RACIST on to the bust that adorns the front of the school building as part of a campaign to get the school renamed. Without any ado we are fulfilling Waterloo Roads key remit of tackling social and political talking points in what is hoped to be an accessible way. As a paintbomb riot threatens to cause lessons to be suspended on the first day of term Kim has to balance her sympathy with the kids antiracist cause with the difficulty of convincing an intransigent impecunious local education authority to fix the problem especially when not everyone thinks there is a problem to be fixed. This is cancel culture says a gobby white kid adding that he considers the protesters to be snowflakes. Later on in the staff room the history teacher Mr Guthrie who spends a lot of the opening episode looking for somewhere to rinse dog mess off his shoe earning him a rocket from the dinner lady Nicky Kym Marsh when he suggests using the canteen sink expresses his own scepticism The conversation should be about historical context not cancel culture Children we are learning about cancel culture and we are not doing it subtly. But really we are not learning about it at all since a proper examination of the arguments around the veneration of problematic historical figures wouldnt fit into an 8pm drama. The expectation is that mentioning it will prompt thought and debate in the audience with the same objective attached to the story of a former pupil who through a combination of a tough family life and the disruption of the pandemic has ended up homeless and becomes a representation of all the kids who have fallen through the new cracks in society since Waterloo Road was last broadcast. Does it help important moral debates when they are the backdrop to a drama that seems more comfortable delivering classic soap storylines such as the one that engulfs the original characters Donte Adam Thomas and Chlo Katie Griffiths tearaway pupils who have now become conscientious hopeful nervous young parents Does it benefit an eventful broadbrush soap if it keeps stopping to talk about white privilege Will viewers who binged Waterloo Road when they were at a loose end make the sort of commitment that warrants a revival Wellintentioned as they are these fictional teachers still look as if they are doing an impossible job.,2023-01-03T21:00:58Z

He’s a smooth operator … and truly his mother’s sonKing Charles, as the Prince of Wales, gave one TV interview (on ITV in 1994). Diana, Princess of …",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/12/prince-harry-interviews-tv-appearances-in-order-of-greatness,King Charles as the Prince of Wales gave one TV interview on ITV in 1994. Diana Princess of Wales on BBC One 1995 and HRH Prince Andrew on BBC One 2019 also did the same and only Diana seems likely to have considered the primetime conversation successful. But Harry Duke of Sussex has now made 11 highprofile TV appearances from Oprah With Meghan and Harry CBS and ITV 2021 through the six parts of the documentary series Harry Meghan Netflix to the four British and US interviews this week to promote his memoir Spare. So how well did Harry use the medium and how well did it use him Harry The Interview ITV 8 Jan Production Any interview pegged to a painfully revelatory memoir faces the technical hitch of how a person can be expected to adlib their tragedies for viewers convenience. ITVs elegant solution was to use extracts from Harrys audiobook recording to set up discussions. Harry Beyond those who have objected to Harry from monarchist disrespect to the crown or classist selfpitying superrich brat perspectives those who tuned in openminded may have been pleasantly surprised to find an articulate thoughtful engaging and amusing man. Harry has inherited his mothers media poise. Only the hardest heart could not feel sympathy for his clearly deep scars unable to forget his mothers death or forgive the media for what he sees as their role in it. Interviewer Under usual media conflictofinterest rules Tom Bradby a longtime friend of both Dianas sons should have been exactly the wrong choice. In practice familiarity allowed him to eschew the sycophancy of US interviewers from Oprah onwards while Harry was usefully aware that Bradby has his own knowledge of some of the events and people mentioned. Cannily though the host also maintained his journalistic rigour often using a resting sceptical expression. And in the moment interviewers dread when Harry challenged the host to answer one of his own complicated questions the ITV man calmly delineated without notes the intricacies of the princes three legal battles in the UK. Against the odds an already formidable broadcaster emerged with reputation enhanced. Revelations In this first interview screened before the book was published Harrys disclosure that he has no memories of the period after his mums death was startling and poignant. The explanation of some of his interactions with the media will have made some British media uncomfortable as their coverage of the show possibly reflected. TV crowns The Late Show With Stephen Colbert CBS 10 Jan Production Harrys Harry Either the prince or his handlers had gambled that host Stephen Colbert tends when faced with a highranking newsy guest the Obamas Clintons to drop the satire. Apart from a couple of comedy bits a skit with royal heralds and Tom Hanks and drinking tequila shots with Colbert that felt illjudged Harry was able to be deeply serious about favoured themes such as mental health the British media while also cannily flattering his new home America is a great place to live and as the most successful guests on US talkshows do engaging directly with the studio audience. It has been increasingly hard this week to see any reconciliation with the royals but this appearance teased a possible future for Harry. Theres a long tradition of hit chatshow guests Oprah Winfrey James Corden Terry Wogan John Bishop moving into the main chair. A sharp producer might sign up Harry to host a series of chats for which everyone from Sir Elton John to President Biden would surely agree. Interviewer Mainly eschewing comedy except for an exchange about a cock sock the Cword bleeped to prevent frostbite Colbert was empathic his father and two brothers died in an accident when he was 10 intelligent and forensic. His solution to the issue of how to transmit the content of the book was to read and internalise it to the extent that he could describe and quote content without notes. Revelations Even those sympathetic to Harry were thrown by reports that the book boasted of his number of Taliban kills in Afghanistan. Prompted and endorsed by Colbert the prince was able to present those paragraphs in a different light a reflection on military veterans difficulty in living with the knowledge of killings and a plea for more understanding of this haunting to prevent more suicides. Harrys receipt of a round of applause for that line represented a stunningly effective reversal of a media narrative and again showed how as a smooth media performer he is completely his mothers son. TV crowns 60 Minutes Prince Harry CBS 8 Jan Production Clunkily host Anderson Cooper read out chunks from a copy of Spare then asked the prince to parse them like a college tutorial. The bigger vibe though was shrink and client Cooper smiling benignly behind expensive spectacles sometimes seemed at risk of handing Harry a bill and fixing the next session. Harry Pronouncing route in the American way to rhyme with shout the prince will have to watch where his accent ends up with signs of it splashing into midAtlantic like David Frosts. Interviewer Coopers solemnity blocked off the cheeky side of the princes personality that showed in other chats. When Harry mentioned his aunt taking him to see HM the Queens body a British presenter would have gathered that he was talking about HRH Princess Anne fleshing out the anecdote. Revelations For UK viewers who had seen the Bradby the content was largely familiar for US viewers it would have had the impact of the ITV show. Cooper got more on the depth of royal enmities Harry hasnt for a while had any contact with his dad or brother. The freshest information was an explanation of why the royals are so obsessed with the press. All the papers are laid out at breakfast so its hard not to know whats being said about you. TV crowns Good Morning America ABC 9 Jan Production The closest Harry Few politicians and certainly not the last four UK prime ministers or the two most recent US presidents could get through such a varied sequence of interviews without significant stumbling or discomfort. After this week even Harry haters and doubters might have to accept that he is a fluent media performer. Transcripts of the four interviews are remarkably free of the word um. To Strahans Elizabeth II question for instance he denied it to his gran nothing came as a surprise without giving the direct quotes from the monarch for which the questioner was fishing. Interviewer Strahan was prepped and sharp Revelations Strahans direct questioning required the prince to be less euphemistic than elsewhere about family rifts but there was no scoop.

Video of the event showed some mourners looking confused when the dancers emerged from pews midway through the funeral of Sandie Wood from Bristol before they began clapping along to the rock anthem. Wood who died in September aged 65 was one of 30000 victims of the contaminated blood scandal. She had requested the stunt as part of a funeral that also included her sparkly highheeled shoes and handbags being displayed alongside her pink coffin. The words Going out in style were written on the coffin. Speaking to the BBC her friend Sam Ryalls said She wanted everyone to remember her funeral but not for sad reasons. She left the world as she lived it and that was being herself. Ryalls told the Sun it was difficult to find dancers willing to perform at a funeral. They all said they werent comfortable doing it she said. But the cabaret dance group Flaming Feathers who provide dance classes in Bristol and Bath accepted the challenge. Claire Phipps one of the groups dancers told the BBC that flashmobbing a funeral was a bit daunting. But she added It was also really exciting because it was different to what we normally do. We had to sit through half the service along with everyone else with our coats on so that was quite nerveracking. And then when the music came on nobody had a clue whats going to happen and then obviously we had to jump up and do our routine. So it was scary but a memory that well never forget. And it was a lot of fun.,2023-01-12T11:54:22Z
58,"Serial killer The Serpent, Charles Sobhraj, freed from Nepal jail","Charles Sobhraj, convicted of killing two women in 1975, was linked to tourist murders in South East Asia.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-64073271,Serial killer The Serpent Charles Sobhraj deported from Nepal Published A French serial killer known as The Serpent convicted of several tourist murders in Asia in the 1970s has arrived back in France after being released from prison in Nepal. Charles Sobhraj 78 was freed after a court ruled in favour of his age and good behaviour. He spent 19 years in jail in Nepal for killing two North Americans in 1975. Sobhraj had preyed on mostly young Western backpackers on the hippie trail in India and Thailand. He was deported to France on Friday and has reportedly been barred from returning to Nepal for at least 10 years. The notorious killer whose story was covered in the TV drama The Serpent had been concurrently serving two sentences each 20 years in Nepals capital Kathmandu for the 1975 murder of an American woman Connie Jo Bronzich and her Canadian backpacker friend Laurent Carriere. He had been convicted in two separate trials most recently in 2014 when he was sent to a highsecurity prison for murdering Carriere. But Nepals Supreme Court ordered Sobhrajs release on Wednesday after his legal team successfully filed a petition claiming he should be given a concession on his prison term for health reasons. A provision in Nepalese law also allows inmates who have shown good character and completed 75 of their jail term to be released. Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoners human rights the verdict read according to AFP citing regular treatment for heart disease as another factor in his release. He had heart surgery in 2017. In an interview with AFP ahead of his departure on Friday Sobhraj said he felt great about being given his freedom but would be seeking legal action against the Nepalese government. Sobhraj has been linked to more than 20 killings between 1972 and 1982 in which the victims were drugged strangled beaten or burned. He was dubbed The Serpent or the Bikini Killer for his knack for deceptive disguises ability to escape prison and tendency to target young women. It later became the title for a hit BBC and Netflix series about the killer which was released in 2021. Before his two convictions in Kathmandu Sobhraj had already spent two decades in jail in India for poisoning a busload of French tourists. During that time he briefly managed to escape from prison by drugging the prison guards. He later claimed the escape was a ploy to get his sentence extended and avoid extradition to Thailand where he was wanted for five more murders. Thai authorities had issued a warrant for him in the mid1970s on charges of drugging and killing six women some who were found dead on a beach near the resort town of Pattaya. Following his release from India in 1997 Sobhraj returned to France where he lived in Paris and gave paid interviews to journalists. But he returned to Nepal and was arrested for Bronzichs murder in 2003 after being spotted by a reporter in a casino in Kathmandu.,2022-12-23T07:54:42Z

60,Surendran Pattel: The US judge who once made cigarettes in India,Surendran K Pattel's inspiring rise from a life of grinding poverty has made headlines in India.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64232516,Surendran Pattel The US judge who once made cigarettes in India Published Last week when Indianorigin lawyer Surendran K Pattel took the oath as a district judge in a US court he made headlines back home because of his inspiring journey. BBC Hindis Imran Qureshi tells the story of a man who went from making handrolled cigarettes in India to becoming an arbiter of justice. Mr Pattel 51 who is from the southern Indian state of Kerala has been appointed a judge in the 240th Judicial District Court in Fort Bend County in Texas state. He was sworn in on 1 January five years after he became a US citizen his journey Mr Pattel says was all about hard work determination and a lot of struggle. But there were also a lot of people who supported and helped me at every stage of my life he says saying that the list is topped by his mother whom he calls a symbol of sacrifice. Mr Pattel spent his childhood in grinding poverty. His parents were labourers who depended on meagre daily wages to feed their six children. As a child Mr Pattel would roll beedis traditional cigarettes made by wrapping raw tobacco in leaves so that we could have three meals a day. My elder sister and I used to sit late into the night doing this he says. As a teenager he dropped out of school after not scoring well in his exams. He had almost accepted his lot in life when his eldest sister died leaving behind a 15 monthold daughter. The case was determined to be a suicide but I felt that justice had not been done in the matter. It still haunts me he told the BBC without giving more details about the incident. The tragedy spurred him to redefine his future and he rejoined school and studied hard. When he was in a twoyear predegree course before going to college Mr Pattel often had to skip classes because he had to work too. In his first year he had to plead with his teachers after they asked him not to take the final exams due to low attendance. I didnt want to tell them that I wasnt going to class because of my financial situation because I didnt want sympathy he says. His teachers gave him another chance they only learnt later from his friends that he had no choice but to work. When the results came out Mr Pattel surprised everyone by ranking second in his class. He also decided that his future lay in law. I never wanted to do anything else. I am so passionate about it he says. Mr Pattels financial situation continued to pose challenges but he was helped by the generosity of people he met along the way. One of them was a Mr Uttupp who ran a hotel in Kerala. I told him if he did not give me a job I would have to discontinue my education. He hired me as part of the housekeeping staff in the hotel Mr Pattel says. The relationship continued until Mr Uttupps death. His brother Manuel even called me after the news broke that I had become a judge Mr Pattel says. Mr Pattel got a degree in political science in 1992 before studying law. Four years later he got a job with lawyer P Appukuttan and began working in the town of Hosdurg in Keralas Kasaragod district. He was so enthusiastic that I trusted him. I entrusted all kinds of civil matters to him because he was capable of doing it Mr Appukuttan told the BBC. Mr Pattel worked there for a decade until his wife Subha got a job at a hospital in Indias capital Delhi. He decided to follow her because he never wanted to come in the way of her career. In Delhi he worked with a Supreme Court lawyer for a few months before his wife had to move again this time to the US. Even though I wasnt happy about leaving my profession behind I followed her. Without her I would not have been where I am today Mr Pattel says. The couple moved to Texas in 2007 where Mr Pattel worked in a grocery store for some time before realising that he could take the Bar exam in Texas. He then went on to get a degree in international law. When Mr Pattel decided to run for the post of the judge with the Democratic Party he had some unpleasant experiences for instance he was mocked for his Indian accent while campaigning he says. But I was not hurt by it. Campaigns can be nasty sometimes. I think it doesnt matter how long you live here what matters is how long you have served the community he adds. The American journey he says has been a rewarding one I became a citizen only in 2017 and now in 2022 I have won an election. I dont think this can happen in any other country. His victory is also special for a personal reason. While practising in Texas Mr Pattel became very close to a senior lawyer Glenden B Adams. When Mr Adams died his wife Rosalie Adams asked Mr Pattel to be a pallbearer. On Wednesday when he began his new role it was Rosalie Adams who put the robes on me at my private investiture in my courtroom.,2023-01-12T04:55:02Z
61,China Covid: Young people self-infect as fears for elderly grow,Cases are surging as the country reopens after the sudden reversal of three years of restrictions.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-64183281,China Covid Young people selfinfect as fears for elderly grow Published When Mr Chens 85yearold father fell ill with Covid in December it was impossible to get an ambulance or see a doctor. They went to Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing where they were told to either try other hospitals or sit in the corridor with an IV drip. There was no bed no respiratory machine no medical equipment available Mr Chen tells the BBC. His father managed to find a bed at another hospital but only through a special contact and had by then developed a severe lung infection. The elder Mr Chen has now recovered but his son worries that a second infection in the future could kill him. Three years of Covid prevention measures were a complete waste and failure he says because the government eased controls too quickly with no preparation and so many have caught the virus. The outbreak will come back again. For elderly people they can only count on their own fate Mr Chen says. The final step in Chinas swift reversal of its contentious zeroCovid policy comes on Sunday when it reopens borders for international travel. With mass testing stringent quarantines and sudden sweeping lockdowns gone families like Mr Chens are wary of what lies ahead. But younger Chinese all of whom did not wish to be named feel differently and some told the BBC they were voluntarily exposing themselves to infection. A 27yearold coder in Shanghai who did not receive any of the Chinese vaccines says he voluntarily exposed himself to the virus. Because I dont want to change my holiday plan he explains and I could make sure I recovered and wont be infected again during the holiday if I intentionally control the time I get infected. He admits he did not expect the muscle aches that came with the infection but says the symptoms have been largely as expected. Another Shanghai resident a 26yearold woman tells the BBC she visited her friend who had tested positive so I could get Covid as well. But she says her recovery has been hard I thought it would be like getting a cold but it was much more painful. A 29yearold who works for a staterun business based in Jiaxing in the northern Zhejiang province says she was thrilled when she heard the countrys borders were reopening. She is excited to travel to other parts of China again to see concerts. Life was ridiculous when I had to ask my managers permission to travel. I just want life to get back to normal she says. But I do worry about the elderly. When her grandfather fell sick with Covid he refused to go to hospital even when his condition took a turn for the worse she says. And reports of overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums have only added to the worry she says she has heard stories of corpses piled high in funeral parlours. She herself has not tested positive for the virus yet but concedes that when her husband did she wore a mask 247 at home even when she was sleeping. I did not want us to be sick at the same time she says. But Im not scared of the virus as the severe symptoms are rare. At least in the big cities people have been returning to malls restaurants and parks and even queuing up for visas and tourist permits. The staterun Global Times newspaper declared normal times are back attributing the line to interviews with Chinese. If normal days are indeed back it is an uncomfortable return to normalcy for many. Mrs Lius husband never got vaccinated because he suffers from advanced diabetes. Since the reopening she has stayed indoors and has disinfected every home delivery that has arrived but the couple still caught the virus. Their daughter also sick with Covid scoured various locations in the midst of a cold Beijing winter for Paxlovid Pfizers antiviral Covid medication before finally purchasing a single box off the black market at 7500 CNY 918. My husband has recovered smoothly. Its a big relief for me Mrs Liu says. But when the second wave comes what will happen to him Ms Wang another Beijing resident and her family have prepurchased Paxlovid before it becomes too expensive as well as an oxygenator and pulse oximeter for her grandfatherinlaw. He has not gotten the virus but is in his 90s. Anyways the openup is good for the economy. Business has recovered quickly she remarks adding that hotels restaurants and shopping malls are all filling up with people again. But beyond the major cities it is difficult to know how people particularly in Chinas rural regions are responding to an aboutface in government messaging. For three years staterun media presented the virus as a dangerous menace to society vowing that it would achieve dynamic zeroCovid to keep the population safe. But that rhetoric has been turned on its head in recent weeks with doctors regularly trotted out to call for calm over confusion. Mrs Li a 52yearold in Beijing argues the government did the right thing for the first two years but should have ended its zeroCovid policy in early 2022. Now we finally have all controls eased but its too sudden. The government could have done it phase by phase region by region. Also winter is the worst season to do it. Why not wait until next spring And why didnt the government prepare enough resources before opening up she asks. 2022 was the worst year for us. I can only pray 2023 wont be any worse.,2023-01-06T07:18:33Z
62,Eritrean Catholic Bishop Fikremariam Hagos freed from detention,"After returning from Europe in October, the cleric was detained without being charged or put on trial.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64110849,Eritrean Catholic Bishop Fikremariam Hagos freed from detention Published A leading Catholic bishop in Eritrea has been freed from detention after being held without trial since October reliable sources have told the BBC. Bishop Fikremariam Hagos was released along with a parish priest Abba Mihretab Stefanos. No reasons were given by the authorities for their detention. The Catholic Church has repeatedly called for an end to oneparty rule in Eritrea and for democracy to be embraced. The Catholic Archbishop of Asmara and a small congregation gathered to welcome the clerics after their release. Eritrea has not held a national election since it gained independence from Ethiopia in 1991. It has been ruled since then by President Isaias Afwerki. His regime has been accused of human rights abuses including violating religious rights. The bishop had been detained since 15 October after he returned to the capital Asmara from a trip to Europe. In 2019 the authorities shut Catholicrun schools and hospitals saying that religious bodies could not run such institutions. Catholics make up about 4 of Eritreas population. The church is one of only four religious groups allowed to operate in Eritrea along with the Eritrean Orthodox Evangelical Lutheran and Sunni Muslim groups.,2022-12-29T14:39:20Z
63,Marion Biotech: Uzbekistan links child deaths to India cough syrup,The latest allegation comes weeks after The Gambia blamed Indian syrups for child deaths.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64114240,Marion Biotech Uzbekistan links child deaths to India cough syrup Published Uzbekistans health ministry has said that 18 children have died after drinking a cough syrup manufactured by Indian drug maker Marion Biotech. The ministry said that preliminary tests showed a batch of the medicine contained ethylene glycol a toxic substance. The children were given the Dok1 Max syrup without a doctors prescription it said. The amount they consumed also exceeded the standard dose for children. The allegation from Uzbekistan comes weeks after The Gambia also linked child deaths to cough syrups made by another Indian firm. Indias health ministry said in a statement that its officials have been in regular contact with the national drug regulator of Uzbekistan regarding the matter since 27 December. It added that health officials have conducted an inspection of Marion Biotechs facility in Noida in Uttar Pradesh state. The samples of the cough syrup have been taken from the manufacturing premises and sent to Regional Drugs Testing Laboratory Chandigarh for testing the statement added. Marion Biotech has not responded to the BBCs request for comment yet. Marion Biotech is based in Noida near Indias national capital Delhi. Its website is currently down but the companys LinkedIn page says it was founded in 1999 and that its products are household names in Central Asian countries Central and Latin America South East Asia and Africa. India produces a third of the worlds medicines mostly in the form of generic drugs. The country home to some of the fastestgrowing pharmaceutical companies is known as the worlds pharmacy and meets much of the medical needs of developing countries. The Uzbek ministry statement dated 27 December says that Dok1 Max tablets and syrup have been sold in the country since 2012. It was found that the deceased children before admission to hospital treatment took this drug at home for 27 days 34 times a day 2. 55ml which exceeds the standard dose of the drug for children the ministry said. The statement did not specify over what time period the deaths occurred. BBC Monitoring had reported on 23 December citing news website Gazeta. uz that Uzbek authorities were investigating claims that 15 children died in central Samarkand region over the past two months after taking a cough syrup made in India. On 26 December Podrobno. uz news website reported that 21 children 15 of them under the age of three were treated for acute kidney failure allegedly caused by the Indiamade cough syrup Dok1 Max between September and December. Three of the patients recovered. The ministry also said that preliminary laboratory studies have shown that this series of Dok1 Max syrup contains ethylene glycol. In October the World Health Organization WHO had sounded a global alert and linked four Indiamade cough syrups to the deaths of 66 children from kidney injuries in The Gambia. It said tests on samples of the syrup showed that they contained unacceptable amounts of toxic substances diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol. Both the Indian government and the company Maiden Pharmaceuticals have denied the allegations. India said earlier in December that tests on the four syrups showed that they complied with specifications and a government official told the BBC that the WHO had been presumptuous in blaming the syrups. But the WHO said it stood by the action taken. Last week a parliamentary committee in The Gambia recommended prosecution of Maiden Pharmaceuticals after weeks of investigation. The committee also recommended banning all products by the firm in the country. How could this be happening As with the tragic reports from Uzbekistan deaths of children in The Gambia were linked to Indianmade cough mixtures laced with high quantities of ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol both toxic substances with the former found in among other things antifreeze. Indian laws do require that all manufacturers adhere to strict quality control and production practices. Experts we spoke to said that regulations suggest drugs meant for export are subject to same standards as those meant for local consumption but it is unclear exactly how those standards are enforced. Publichealth activist Dinesh Thakur points out the lack of proper accountability for producing substandard medicine. Currently a fine of 242 220 and a possible prison sentence of up to two years is the punishment. Unless one can causally establish a direct link between a substandard drug and a fatality this is the norm of punishment meted out he told the BBC. Countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia have banned Indianmade manufacturers due to substandard medicines in the past. The US Food and Drugs Administration has also banned some Indianmade medicines due to quality control issues.,2022-12-29T06:31:35Z
64,US winter storm: Americans and Canadians face mass outages on Christmas Day,At least 19 deaths are linked to a massive winter storm that continues to pummel the US and Canada.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64088985,US winter storm Americans and Canadians face mass outages on Christmas Day Published More than one million Americans and Canadians are facing Christmas Day without power as a massive winter storm continues to pummel North America. A bomb cyclone when atmospheric pressure plummets has brought snow strong winds and freezing temperatures. Nearly 250 million are affected and at least 19 deaths have been linked to the storm that extends more than 2000 miles 3200km from Quebec to Texas. Thousands of flights have been cancelled during the festive period. The western US state of Montana is the worst hit by the cold with temperatures dropping to 50F 45C. Near whiteout conditions have been reported in Minnesota Iowa Wisconsin and Michigan. In the city of Buffalo New York state the US National Weather Service NWS reported zero mile visibility. In the Pacific Northwest some residents iceskated on frozen streets in Seattle and Portland. Coastal flooding has been seen in Americas northeastern New England region inundating communities and downing power lines. Even the usually milder southern states of Florida and Georgia are experiencing hardfreeze warnings. The only region that has largely been spared the cold weather is California where continental mountain ranges are helping to protect the Golden State. In Canada the provinces of Ontario and Quebec were bearing the brunt of the Arctic blast. Much of the rest of the country from British Columbia to Newfoundland was under extreme cold and winter storm warnings. A number of the stormrelated fatalities have involved road traffic accidents including a 50car pileup in Ohio that killed four motorists. Another four died in separate crashes in the state. Travel problems across the country were being exacerbated by a shortage of snowplough operators with low pay rates being blamed. The NWS says more than 100 daily cold temperature records could be tied or broken over the next few days.

66,Thor the walrus filmed returning to the sea at Scarborough,"Arctic mammal had won the hearts of residents and caused the town’s fireworks display to be cancelledA wandering Arctic walrus, who won the hearts of local residents and tourists, has been filmed returning to the sea in Scarborough.The arrival on Saturday of …",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/01/thor-the-walrus-filmed-returning-to-the-sea-at-scarborough,A wandering Arctic walrus who won the hearts of local residents and tourists has been filmed returning to the sea in Scarborough. The arrival on Saturday of the mammal nicknamed Thor to the North Yorkshire seaside town drew huge crowds keen to catch a glimpse of the creature. In footage shown on the BBC on Sunday the creature can be seen inching towards the sea plopping in and then swimming off seemingly bringing an end to his Scarborough sojourn. It is thought that Thor is the same walrus spotted on the Hampshire coast three weeks ago. Wildlife experts have suggested that Thor had needed to rest before moving on to continue his journey north. Chris Cook from the British Divers Marine Life Rescue BDMLR charity said It is extremely rare that an Arctic walrus should come ashore on the Yorkshire coast. He added that the creature had needed time to rest and recuperate before it continues its journey. Now it would seem that time has come. After Thors arrival believed to be the first time a walrus has been spotted in Yorkshire a cordon was put in place to keep excited crowds from getting too close. One local described the throng as reminiscent of the numbers they see during the height of the summer season. Resident Richard Coulson 51 told the PA news agency the area had been teeming with cars and people since Thor arrived at the harbour. Such was Thors impact Scarborough borough council decided to call off its New Years Eve fireworks display over fears it could cause distress to the mammal. While council leader Steve Siddons had expressed disappointment he added that the welfare of the walrus has to take precedence.,2023-01-01T19:41:02Z
67,Russia-Ukraine war: Drone attacks continue on Kyiv and eastern Ukraine,Air raid sirens sounded shortly before midnight as the latest in a wave of attacks by Russia over the New Year period began.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64142650,Ukraine claims hundreds of Russians killed by missile attack Published Ukraine has confirmed it carried out a strike in the occupied region of Donetsk which it earlier claimed killed 400 Russian troops. Russian officials contested the figure saying only 63 troops were killed. Neither claim has been verified and access to the site is restricted. The attack on New Years Day hit a building in the city of Makiivka where Russian forces were stationed. It is extremely rare for Moscow to confirm any battlefield casualties. But this was such a deadly attack says the BBCs Russia editor Steve Rosenberg that staying silent most probably wasnt an option. It is the highest number of deaths acknowledged by Moscow in a single incident since the war began ten months ago. In a statement on Monday Russias defence ministry said Ukrainian forces fired six rockets using the USmade Himars rocket system at a building housing Russian troops. Two of them were shot down it added. A number of Russian commentators and bloggers acknowledged the attack but said the numbers were lower than claimed by Ukraine. But Igor Girkin a proRussian commentator said hundreds had been killed and wounded although the exact number was still unknown because of the large number still missing. The building itself was almost completely destroyed he said. He added that the victims were mainly mobilised troops that is recent conscripts rather than those who chose to fight. He also said ammunition was stored in the same building as the soldiers making the damage worse. Almost all of the military equipment was also destroyed which stood right next to the building without any disguise whatsoever he wrote on Telegram. Girkin is a wellknown military blogger who led Russianbacked separatists when they occupied of large parts of eastern Ukraine in 2014. He was recently found guilty of murder for his part in the shooting down of flight MH17. Despite his proRussian stance he regularly criticises the Russian military leadership and their tactics. According to the Ukrainian militarys earlier statement 300 were wounded in addition to the estimated 400 killed. Ukraines army claims almost daily to have killed dozens sometimes hundreds of soldiers in attacks so caution is needed. A later statement from the Ukrainian militarys general staff said up to 10 units of enemy military equipment were destroyed and damaged in the strikes and that the losses of personnel of the occupiers are being specified. Ukraine has not confirmed the strikes were carried out with Himars missiles maintaining a longheld strategy of not releasing specific details about its attacks. Hours after the strike in Makiivka Kyiv came under fire. A drone and missile attack targeted critical infrastructure the Ukrainian capitals regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba said. One man in Kyiv was injured by debris from a destroyed Russian drone the capitals mayor added. Mr Kuleba said the weapons were Iranianmade Shahed drones adding that they were targeting critical infrastructure facilities. The main thing now is to stay calm and stay in shelters until the alarm is off he said. All 39 Iranian made drones were eventually shot down by Ukraine the military said. But Vitaly Klitschko the mayor of Kyiv said energy facilities were damaged disrupting power and heating supplies. Russia has been targeting Ukraines energy infrastructure for several months destroying power stations and plunging millions into darkness during the countrys freezing winter.,2023-01-02T02:14:39Z

69,"Somalia's opioid overdose: Young, female and addicted",Women open up about the problem of opioid abuse in Somalia following the death of a popular TikToker.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-64032267,Somalias opioid overdose Young female and addicted Published It was the discovery of the body of a 22yearold woman on the streets of the Somali capital Mogadishu last year that brought into the open the problem of female drug addiction in the city. Health workers said she died from an opioid overdose. Friends of the social media influencer said she had been injecting drugs for a long time. They said she was high when she recorded some of her popular TikTok videos. Police have registered an increase in substance abuse in Mogadishu and elsewhere in Somalia including among women. They say people are turning to new types of drugs. Whereas they used to chew the narcotic leaf khat which is not illegal drink alcohol sniff glue or smoke hashish more and more people are abusing opioids which they inject directly into their veins. These include morphine tramadol pethidine and codeine. In early December police seized a large consignment of prescription drugs mainly opioids at Mogadishus international airport. They arrested the importers. Pills and injectable drugs are especially popular with young women and girls said a doctor in Mogadishu who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject. Many of these substances are addictive and they are readily available to buy without prescription in pharmacies all over the city. I started sleeping in cars Another popular drug used by young women is a form of chewing tobacco known as tabbuu which can cause mouth and throat cancer. Amino Abdi 23 has been abusing drugs for the past five years. Although female drug addiction is a taboo subject in Somalia she has decided to speak about it openly to the BBC in the hope that she can help break the silence and reduce prejudice. I started off chewing tabbuu with the girls I lived with she says. They were a bad influence on me. I became addicted to tobacco then moved on to harder drugs especially those I could inject intravenously mainly tramadol and pethidine. Ms Abdi says her drug use skyrocketed after she started having problems with her husband. She is now divorced and lives with her young daughter. My ex is the reason I became addicted to hard drugs. My addiction got so bad that I lost my mind. I started sleeping in cars and on the streets. Ms Abdi is trying to come off drugs but says it is very difficult to do so because there are no proper rehabilitation centres in Somalia to manage her withdrawal. She says it is impossible to stop all the drugs at the same time. She has managed to reduce her habit of injecting opioids but still chews tobacco and smokes shisha. Parents especially mothers are desperately worried about the growing drug problem among their daughters some of whom are still at school. She was sleeping at strange times and acting out of character... I confronted her and she told me she had started taking drugs because of peer pressure Khadijo Adan noticed her 14yearold daughter was behaving in an unusual way. She was sleeping at strange times and acting out of character she says. One day I found tramadol pills and chewing tobacco in her bag. I confronted her and she told me she had started taking drugs because of peer pressure. Ms Adan sent her child to live in a centre run by Muslim sheikhs. She is no longer taking drugs because it is impossible for her to access them there. Many parents send their problem children to such institutions especially those with mental illnesses those involved in crime or drugs and those suspected of being gay. Serious abuses have taken place in some centres including the chaining and beating of inmates. Street children at risk As it struggles to cope with the worst drought in 40 years and more than three decades of conflict Somalias limited resources are unable to cover the most basic of human needs let alone tackle problems like drug addiction. A few small organisations are trying to fill the gap by spreading awareness about the dangers of drugs. The Green Crescent Society visits schools and universities to warn students about different types of addiction including substance abuse gambling gaming and social media. Sirad Mohamed Nur runs the Mama Ugaaso Foundation which focuses on drug abuse among young people including girls. We do our best to discourage the youth from taking drugs by holding awareness programmes which highlight the health risks associated with substance abuse. We also lobby the government to step in and do something. But this is not enough. Drastic measures are needed to prevent this scourge from getting out of hand especially among street children. According to the Ministry of Women and Human Rights Development more than 40 of street children take drugs. About a fifth of street children in Somalia are girls. Some 10 are under six years old some as young as three. Although khat glue and chewing tobacco are the most common substances abused by street children a study conducted by the ministry found that nearly 10 use opioids and about 17 use sleeping tablets. Increased drug abuse among marginalised youth has led to an increase in crime including violence against women and girls. According to the research body Somali Public Agenda it has also led to the recent phenomenon of street gangs known as Ciyal Weero which have been striking terror across Mogadishu. In some cases drugs are used to take advantage women such as in the southwestern city of Baidoa where a woman was reportedly raped after being given an opioid. There is a risk that the rise in intravenous drugtaking will overturn Somalias relatively low prevalence of HIV and Aids. The recent growth of people injecting drugs especially opioids is putting a whole new group of Somalis at risk of catching the virus says Dr Sadia Abdisamad Abdulahi the HIV programme manager at the Somali health ministry. Crackdown on chemists Health professionals say one of the most effective ways of tackling the opioid problem is to target the people who sell the drugs most of whom are pharmacists. Police have started to crack down on them. A pharmacist who did not want to give his name says he and his colleagues are not at all happy about the police intervention. I have run a pharmacy in Mogadishu for many years. It used to be so easy to sell drugs to young people including girls partly because nobody knew what kind of effect the drugs would have on them he said. We used to sell to everyone and we made good money. But parents are now working with the police who have started to monitor and sometimes arrest us. We now fear selling drugs to young people and are losing income as a result. By speaking out about female drug abuse brave young women like Amino Abdi and mothers like Khadijo Adan have taken the important first step of bringing the issue into the open. Police intervention and drug awareness programmes will also help but without more resources and attention it is unlikely the problem will go away anytime soon.

Tate was arrested in Romania after authorities there were supposedly tipped off to his presence by a series of enraged and transparently humiliated postings on Twitter in response to teenage activist Greta Thunberg tweeting smalldickenergygetalife. com at him. On Thursday night Romanias Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism issued a statement but did not name the Tate brothers stating that two British citizens and two Romanian citizens were suspected of being part of a human trafficking group. The statement said officers had identified six people who were allegedly sexually exploited by what it called an organised criminal group. Police alleged the victims were recruited by the British citizens who they said had misrepresented their intention to enter into a relationship with the victims which it called the loverboy method. They were later forced to perform in pornographic content under threat of violence the statement alleged. My only contribution to this discourse is to point out that legal events like this herald a new level of fake news. Traditional fake news grows more or less from pseudonymous accounts bots and other bottomfeeders and losers then makes its way up bridging trust gaps one tier at a time Infowars can cite whatever Breitbart can cite Infowars the Washington Times can cite Breitbart Fox News can cite the Washington Times and Hillarys health is off to the races. The new fake news though instantiates fullyformed as BREAKING NEWS postings by mediaadjacent social media influencers goes immediately viral and so far never leaves the social media ecology. The two big examples in the last week were fake news that Tory Lanez was acquitted of shooting hiphop star Megan Thee Stallion when in fact he had been convicted and that Andrew Tate was quickly released by Romanian authorities after his arrest two days ago. A distinctive part of it is that the fake news is completely immune to disruption by the emergence of the truth or the parallel virality of the factual coverage. It forms a totally impermeable reality of its own in the comments a bubble in a bought bluecheck.,2022-12-31T20:02:08Z

A video posted to Telegram Friday showed Russians tearing down a ruined theater in Mariupol with a bulldozer. Last December Mariupol was booming covered in Christmas decorations with the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theatre a central point of the city. In the year since Russians have been sucking Ukrainian life out of Mariupol. The video on Telegram recounts a full history of the tragedy of the Drama Theater of Mariupol the post said. It first shows the March bombing in which an investigation from the Associated Press earlier this year found that up to 600 people were killed. The video then shows the burial of civilians in mass graves later in Spring and finally the final demolition of parts of the building which are direct evidence of the war crime of the Russian army in December the Telegram post said. All in one video. For us to remember. Not to forget. Not to forgive. To pay back all the guilty ones those who bombed those who falsified evidence those who hid the crime the Telegram post said. Petro Andryushchenko an aide of Mariupols exiled mayor told the BBC he believes the Russians are trying to cover up the murder of hundreds of civilians in the city. The same building was bombed by Russians in March and was already partially destroyed. Andryushchenko added that he believes that the Russians want to keep the front part of the theater as is but will destroy the remainder to build a new theater on the bones of Mariupols people the BBC reported. For Ukrainians still in Mariupol the Russian army promised alternative entertainment in place of the beloved theater. The BBC reported that to fulfill their promise performances of 1960s Soviet Union cult music are taking place at Pioneers Palace.

73,Anxious Christmas for families of Indians held in Nigeria,Families of 16 Indian sailors who have been detained in Africa since August say they are waiting anxiously.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64061766,The agony of endless wait for Indian sailors held in Nigeria Published It isnt unusual for seafarers to be away from their families for Christmas and other festivals. But this festive season is particularly hard for the families of 16 Indian sailors who have been under arrest in Nigeria since November when their ship was taken into custody by authorities there. The men are part of a 26member crew who were onboard a cargo ship called MT Heroic Idun. The rest of the sailors are from Sri Lanka Philippines and Poland. The ship which is owned by Norways OSM Maritime Group was initially detained by Equatorial Guinea in midAugust based on an alert from Nigeria that the crew may have stolen crude oil from its terminal. This week Indias foreign minister S Jaishankar told parliament that according to a charge sheet filed by Nigerian authorities the crew members have been charged with conspiracy evasion of lawful interception and unlawful export of crude oil. Their case will be heard by a Nigerian court on 10 and 11 January. We are providing them legal support we are giving them consular support and we will do whatever we can to help them in the circumstances the minister added. Nigeria is yet to officially comment on the ministers statement. After four months of anxiety the sailors families say they are somehow clinging onto hope. My husband has been away earlier too during Christmas but never in this kind of a situation Sheethal Milton told the BBC. Her husband Milton Deoth has been a sailor for over two decades and works as a motorman on MT Heroic Idun. In August the ships crew was en route to pick up crude oil from Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria before heading to deliver it in Rotterdam Holland. According to Sapna Trehan wife of the ships master Tanuj Mehta the ship was asked to leave Nigerias AKPO terminal after officials said they had no information about its arrival. As the ship moved towards Equatorial Guinea it was followed by a vessel claiming to be from the Nigerian navy Ms Trehans husband told her adding that the ship was detained on arrival there. Ms Trehan added that the Heroin Idun could not identify the Naval ship in the darkness and assumed that it was a pirate ship. In a press briefing on 15 November a Nigerian navy official said that apart from refusing lawful arrest the Captain of the vessel made a broadcast of false piracy attack call to International Maritime Bureau adding that Nigeria had not recorded any piracy attacks in its waters for more than a year. The official also said the ships crew may have committed offences including violation of customs and immigration laws. Documents filed in the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea say that the Equatorial Guinea navy followed a maritime code of conduct and detained the vessel on an alert sent by the Nigerian naval vessel. The ships management later said that they had paid 2m 2. 12m 1. 76m to authorities in Equatorial Guinea for not putting up the flag of the West African country on the ship while in its waters. When the ship was detained in Equatorial Guinea several crew members had recorded videos and made phone calls to their families begging for help. They had also expressed apprehensions about being taken to Nigeria citing the countrys previous dealings with sailors as the reason for their fears. On 12 November the Nigerian Navy formally seized the ship and parked it about three or four hours from its port Ms Trehan said. The crew members are still on the vessel. Ms Trehan said that the Nigerian Navy has been very responsive to the medical needs of the crew and had provided care to two officers who had developed malaria on the ship. But the crews family members say that the only connection they have with their family members is short twothree minute phone calls once in 12 or 15 days. We are specifically asked to converse in English so that the guards can understand said Matilda Sanu wife of Chief Officer Sanu Jose. Ms Trehan says that she has only spoken to her husband thrice since November. We know that provisions have been provided to the ship by the company officials she said. Days are turning into weeks and months. We dont know what to do Sneha Harshvardhan wife of Harshvardhan Shouche an engineer on the ship told the BBC. For no fault of the crew members we are all suffering. I dont have any words to express our trauma she said.,2022-12-23T00:15:51Z
74,Kerala: The sweet story of India's 'first' Christmas cake,The legend of India's first Christmas cake dates back 140 years to a small town in the southern state of Kerala.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64062202,Kerala The sweet story of Indias first Christmas cake Published Prakash Mambally has a story to tell about the first Christmas cake made in India. In November 1883 a merchant named Murdock Brown went to the Royal Biscuit Factory in what is now the southern Indian state of Kerala and asked its owner Mambally Bapu if he would bake him a cake for Christmas. The Scot who ran a massive cinnamon plantation in the Malabar region of the coastal state then part of a princely state in Britishruled India had brought a sample cake back from Britain. He explained to Mr Bapu how it was made. Mr Bapu knew how to bake bread and biscuits a skill he learnt at a biscuit factory in Burma presentday Myanmar but he had never made a cake. But he decided to give it a try with Mr Browns inputs. The experiment came with some improvisations. Mr Bapu mixed the cake batter with a local brew made of cashew apple instead of the brandy Mr Brown had suggested getting from the nearby French colony of Mahe. The result was a unique plum cake made entirely from local ingredients. When Mr Brown tried it he was so happy with the results that he ordered a dozen more. And that is how the first Christmas cake was made in India says Prakash Mambally the grandson of Mr Bapus nephew. While there are no official documents to back this story Mambally Bapu and the bakery he started which is still going strong in Tellichery now Thalassery are now part of Indias Christmas lore. Four generations on Bapus descendants take pride in the legacy. Bapu popularised British tastes among Indians says Mr Mambally. He even exported cakes and sweets to soldiers during World War I. Later the Mambally family opened several outlets under different names which became a favourite destination for cake lovers. The familys original bakery in Thalassery is now run by Mr Mambally. His grandfather Gopal Mambally had inherited the bakery as his matrilineal inheritance as was the tradition in Kerala at the time. Gopal Mambally had 11 children all of whom joined the family business. The small outlet in Thalassery where it all began has now been relocated to a different neighbourhood Mr Mambally says to make it more visible and accessible to all. But we strictly follow the traditional methods of making the cake to maintain its quality Mr Mambally who is now in his sixties told the BBC. Over the years the family has also added new flavours to the cake. We now make more than two dozen varieties according to the needs of our customers Mr Mambally says. His wife Lizy Prakash says that a majority of their orders come from other Indian cities like Mumbai Bangalore Chennai and Kolkata. We send them our choicest flavours by courier she adds. It is not surprising that Kerala has emerged as a major centre for Christmas cakes Christians make up 18 of the states 33 million people. The state is dotted with small bakeries and cafes known for their desserts. In January 2020 the states bakers association set a Guinness world record for the longest cake in the world with a 5. 3 km 3. 2 miles long cake beating Chinas record of 3. 2 km. After two years of subdued celebrations because of the Covid pandemic the state is gearing up for a vibrant Christmas. At the Mambally bakery preparations for the cake started in November as the bakeries began soaking their ingredients in wine. By the third week of December the cakes were ready. Youngsters mostly prefer fresh cream cakes that have a short shelf life but this Christmas cake is a fastmoving item seasonally Ms Mambally tells the BBC. Mr Mambally says that brisk sales at the outlet start the weekend before Christmas and go on till the New Year.

75,Brazil Congress: Big pro-democracy rallies held to condemn rioters,They come after supporters of ex-President Jair Bolsonaro ransacked the heart of the Brazilian state.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-64219119,Brazil Congress Big prodemocracy rallies held to condemn rioters Published Tens of thousands of people in Brazil have held prodemocracy rallies in an angry response to the storming of Congress by exPresident Jair Bolsonaros supporters. In the countrys largest city of So Paulo crowds chanted that Mr Bolsonaro must go to prison. About 1500 people have been held over Sundays riots in the capital Braslia. They came a week after President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva was sworn in after Octobers election that divided Brazil. On Monday evening the 77yearold new leader widely known as Lula visited the damaged buildings of Congress the presidential palace and Supreme Court together with the countrys governors condemning the terrorist acts and vowing to punish the perpetrators. Mr Bolsonaro 67 has not admitted defeat in the tightlyfought election and flew to the US before the handover on 1 January. On Monday he was admitted to hospital in Florida with abdominal pain. On Monday street rallies were held in a number of cities and towns. The turnout at So Paulos demonstration was impressive the BBCs Katy Watson reports from the city. A part of Paulista Avenue Brazils most famous street was blocked off as crowds filled the area singing dancing and chanting for justice. Many came dressed in red the colours of Lulas Workers Party others waved placards saying No amnesty for the coup mongers and called for those responsible to be punished. There were also chants of Prison for Bolsonaro. I dont agree with what happened in Braslia it was a nightmare. I dont agree with those who believe that with democracy you can use your power to destroy democracy Gabriel who only gave his first name told the BBC. I want to show to the world and our country that even though there are thousands of people who believe the elections werent valid here in Brazil we have a gigantic number of people who believe we can trust our government we can trust in our democracy he said. Marina Rodrigues Carmona another demonstrator told the BBC Polarisation is a big problem everyone has their own ideas and I dont think theres much dialogue between the two sides. There was however a huge police presence. At times the atmosphere has felt tense. People are still processing what happened in Brasilia and nerves havent yet calmed for many our correspondent says. Sundays dramatic scenes in Braslia saw thousands of protesters clad in yellow Brazil football shirts and flags overrun police and ransack the heart of the Brazilian state. Lula was forced to declare emergency powers. On Monday morning heavily armed officers started dismantling a camp of Mr Bolsonaros supporters in Braslia one of a number that have been set up outside army barracks around the country since the tightlyfought presidential election. Authorities arrested 1200 people on Monday in addition to 300 detained a day earlier. Mr Bolsonaro condemned the attack and denied responsibility for encouraging the rioters in a post on Twitter some six hours after violence broke out. Meanwhile Braslia Governor Ibaneis Rocha has been removed from his post for 90 days by the Supreme Court. Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes accused him of failing to prevent the riot and of being painfully silent in the face of the attack. Video shared by the Brazilian outlet O Globo showed some officers laughing and taking photos together as demonstrators occupied the congressional campus in the background. Bolsonaro supporters created camps in cities across Brazil some of them outside the military barracks. That is because his most ardent supporters want the military to intervene and make good elections that they say were stolen. Some protesters are not just angry that Mr Bolsonaro lost the election they want President Lula to return to prison. Lula spent 18 months in jail after being found guilty of corruption in 2017. His convictions were later annulled after initially being sentenced to more than nine years. Heads of state around the world have also denounced the violence. Late on Monday President Joe Biden conveyed the unwavering support of the United States for Brazils democracy during a phone call with Lula the White House said in a statement. Comparisons have been drawn with the storming of the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 by supporters of Donald Trump an ally of Mr Bolsonaro.,2023-01-10T04:40:06Z

S. population to some sort of winter weather advisory or warning. More than 200 million people were under an advisory or warning on Friday the National Weather Service said. The weather services map depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever forecasters said. Power outages have left about 1. 4 million homes and businesses in the dark according to the website PowerOutage which tracks utility reports. The Tennessee Valley Authority the nations largest public utility ended its rolling blackouts Friday afternoon but continued to urge homes and businesses to conserve power. And nearly 5000 flights within into or out of the U. S. were canceled Friday according to the tracking site FlightAware causing more mayhem as travelers try to make it home for the holidays. Weve just got to stay positive said Wendell Davis who plays basketball with a team in France and was waiting at OHare in Chicago on Friday after a series of flight cancellations. The huge storm stretched from border to border. In Canada WestJet canceled all flights Friday at Toronto Pearson International Airport beginning at 9 a. m. as meteorologists in the country warned of a potential onceinadecade weather event. And in Mexico migrants waited near the U. S. border in unusually cold temperatures as they awaited a U. S. Supreme Court decision on whether and when to lift pandemicera restrictions that prevent many from seeking asylum. Forecasters said a bomb cyclone when atmospheric pressure drops very quickly in a strong storm had developed near the Great Lakes stirring up blizzard conditions including heavy winds and snow. Multiple highways were closed and crashes claimed at least five lives officials said. At least one person died in a massive pileup involving at least 50 vehicles on the Ohio Turnpike. A Kansas City Missouri driver was killed Thursday after skidding into a creek and three others died Wednesday in separate crashes on icy northern Kansas roads. Michigan also faced a deluge of crashes including one involving nine semitrailers. Brent Whitehead said it took him 7. 5 hours instead of the usual six to drive from his home near Minneapolis to his parents home outside Chicago on Thursday in sometimes icy conditions. Thank goodness I had my car equipped with snow tires he said. Activists also were rushing to get homeless people out of the cold. Nearly 170 adults and children were keeping warm early Friday in Detroit at a shelter and a warming center that are designed to hold 100 people. This is a lot of extra people but it wasnt an option to turn anyone away said Faith Fowler the executive director of Cass Community Social Services which runs both facilities. In Chicago Andy Robledo planned to spend the day organizing efforts to check on people without housing through his nonprofit Feeding People Through Plants. Robledo and volunteers build tents modeled on icefishing tents including a plywood subfloor. Its not a house its not an apartment its not a hotel room. But its a huge step up from what they had before Robledo said. In Portland Oregon nearly 800 people slept at five emergency shelters on Thursday night as homeless outreach teams fanned out to distributed coldweather survival gear. DoorDash and Uber Eats suspended delivery service in some states and bus service was disrupted in places like Seattle. The power ceased at Jaime Sheehans Maryland bakery for about 90 minutes Friday shutting off the convection oven and stilling the mixer she needed to make butter cream. Thankfully all of the orders that were going out today already finished yesterday she said a few moments before the power returned. At about the same time Corey Newcomb and his family were entering their sixth hour without power at their home in the small town of Phenix Virginia. We are coping and thats about it Newcomb said in a Facebook message. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said she was deploying the National Guard to haul timber to the Oglala Sioux and Rosebud Sioux tribes and help with snow removal. We have families that are way out there that we havent heard from in two weeks Wayne Boyd chief of staff to the Rosebud Sioux president said. Fearing that some are running out of food the tribe was hoping to get a helicopter on Saturday to check on the stranded. The Oglala Sioux Tribe meanwhile was using snowmobiles to reach members who live at the end of mileslong dirt roads. Its been one heck of a fight so far said tribal President Frank Star Comes Out. On the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation Harlie Young was huddled with five children and her 58yearold father around a wood stove as 12foot 3. 6meter snow drifts blocked the house. Were just trying to look on the bright side that theyre still coming and they didnt forget us she said Friday as the temperature was 10 degrees minus 21 Celsius with a wind chill of minus21 minus 29C. The weather service is forecasting the coldest Christmas in more than two decades in Philadelphia where school officials shifted classes online Friday. Atop New Hampshires Mount Washington the tallest peak in the Northeast the wind topped 150 mph 241 kph. In Boston rain combined with a high tide sent waves over the seawall at Long Wharf and flooded some downtown streets. It was so bad in Vermont that Amtrak canceled service for the day and nonessential state offices were closing early. Im hearing from crews who are seeing grown trees ripped out by the roots Mari McClure president of Green Mountain Power the states largest utility said at a news conference. Calling it a kitchen sink storm New York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency. In parts of New York City tidal flooding inundated roads homes and businesses Friday morning with police trudging through kneedeep water to pull stranded motorists to safety in Queens. In Iowa sports broadcaster Mark Woodley became a Twitter sensation after he was called on to do live broadcasts outdoors in the wind and snow because sporting events were called off. By midday Friday a compilation of his broadcasts had been viewed nearly 5 million times on Twitter. Ive got good news and Ive got bad news he told an anchor.

Russia fired 69 missiles at energy facilities and Ukrainian forces shot down 54 Ukrainian military chief Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi said. Local officials said attacks killed at least two people around Kharkiv Ukraines secondlargest city. The strikes also wounded at least seven people across the country although the toll of the attacks was growing as officials assessed the days events. Russia dispatched explosive drones to selected regions overnight before broadening the barrage with air and seabased missiles the Ukrainian air force said. Airraid sirens rang out across the country and the military activated airdefense systems in Kyiv the regional administration said. Ukraines defense ministry said the attack damaged 18 residential buildings and 10 pieces of critical infrastructure in 10 regions. Russia has attacked Ukrainian power and water supplies almost weekly since October while its ground forces struggle to hold ground and advance. Mayor Vitali Klitschko warned of power outages in the capital asking people to stockpile water and to charge their electronic devices. In the southeastern Kyiv district of Bortnychi an explosion flattened at least one house and broke the doors roofs and windows of several others nearby. Yana Denysenko went through broken glass inside her grandparents home to collect personal items. Though she does not live there she came immediately after the explosion and found her wounded mother sister and 14yearold niece in ambulances. Denysenko hugged her tearful grandmother Anhelina who was at work when the explosion happened. Im scared to see all this how many mothers are crying Anhelina said. I want my children to recover. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the attacks senseless barbarism. There can be no neutrality in the face of such mass war crimes. Pretending to be neutral equals taking Russias side Kuleba tweeted. After more than 10 months of fighting Russia and Ukraine are locked in a grinding battle of attrition. The Ukrainian military has reclaimed swaths of Russianoccupied territory in the countrys northeast and south and continues to resist persistent Russia attempts to seize all of the industrial Donbas region in the east. At the same time Moscow has targeted Ukrainian power facilities and other key infrastructure in a bid to weaken the countrys resolve and force it to negotiate on Russian terms. The time between strikes has increased in recent weeks though leading some commentators to theorize Russia is trying to ration its missile supply. The Ukrainian military has reported success in shooting down incoming Russian missiles and explosive drones in earlier attacks but many cities have gone without heat internet and electricity for hours or days at a time. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said a number of energy facilities were damaged during what he said was the 10th such largescale attack on his country. Russia is trying to deprive Ukrainians of light before the New Year Shmyhal wrote in a Telegram post. He said that emergency blackouts may be necessary in some areas. About 90 of Lviv was without electricity Mayor Andriy Sadovyi wrote on Telegram. Trams and trolley buses were not working and residents might experience water interruptions he said. Most of the southern city of Odesa and nearby areas were left without power Odesa regional Gov. Maksym Marchenko said in a video statement on Thursday evening. Ukrainian air defense systems shot down 21 Russian missiles he said but some hit infrastructure. Meanwhile a Telegram channel affiliated with the presidential press service of Belarus said a Ukrainian S300 air defense missile landed in Belarusian territory of Belarus early Thursday. It said the missile could have veered off course accidentally and there were no casualties. The Belarusian Defense Ministry said later that the missile was downed by the Belarusian air defense over the western Brest region and fell into a field according to a statement carried by the state Belta news agency. Belarus Russias close ally served as a staging ground for Russias Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Belarus foreign ministry summoned the Ukrainian ambassador to express strong protest it said demanding that Ukraine conduct a thorough investigation and hold those responsible to account. In response Ukraines Defense Ministry said that Kyiv was ready to conduct an objective investigation of the incident and to invite authoritative experts from abroad to participate in it with a caveat that these experts should come from countries that do not support Russia. The United States said this month that it would give a Patriot missile battery to Ukraine to boost the countrys defense. The U. S. and other allies also pledged to provide energyrelated equipment to help Ukraine withstand the attacks on its infrastructure. Mykhailo Podolyak an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was aiming to destroy critical infrastructure and kill civilians en masse. Kuleba the Ukrainian foreign minister said Monday that his nation wants a peace summit within two months at the United Nations with SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres as mediator. He said Russia must face a warcrimes tribunal before his country directly talks with Moscow but that other nations should feel free to engage with the Russians. Commenting on the summit proposal Thursday Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed it as delirious and hollow describing the proposal as a publicity stunt by Washington that tries to cast the Kyiv regime as a peacemaker. Russian officials have said that any peace plan can only proceed from Kyivs recognition of Russias sovereignty over the regions it illegally annexed from Ukraine in September. A 10point peace plan Zelenskyy first presented at a November Group of 20 summit in Bali includes the full restoration of Ukraines territorial integrity the withdrawal of Russian troops the release of all prisoners a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine.

78,"Green comet approaching Earth for first time in 50,000 years",Scientists say the bright green comet will be visible in the night sky for almost a month.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64252258,Green comet approaching Earth for first time in 50000 years Published A bright green comet is set to swing by Earths outer space for the first time in 50000 years and may hang around for a month. NASA officials said the icy visitor was first spotted in March 2022 while it was inside the orbit of Jupiter. It could be seen through binoculars as a small green glow to those in the Northern Hemisphere starting on Thursday. It will be closest to Earth on 2 February scientists said. Comets are notoriously unpredictable but if this one continues its current trend in brightness itll be easy to spot NASA said on its blog earlier this month. Its just possible it could become visible to the unaided eye under dark skies The icy celestial body called C2022 E3 ZTF a mouthful of a name according to NASA is making its closest approach to the sun on 12 January before making its closest approach to Earth on 2 February. At that point it will be just about 26 million miles 42 million kilometres away from the planet according to the Planetary Society. A humbling experience Retired high school science teacher and astrophotographer Dan Bartlett has been capturing images of the comet from his cabin near Yosemite National Park in California and calls looking at the sky a humbling experience. Im telling you binoculars dark site youll see something. Bring friends and you all will see something of a lifetime Mr Bartlett told the BBC. He keeps two pretty impressive scopes on his porch in June Lake and the clear nights and dark skies allow him to capture the impressive photos. Whenever you have a lake system around you or ocean system it causes a smoother airflow. Smoother airflow means the stars dont twinkle as much so you get more details he explained. To observers in the Northern Hemisphere without a telescope the comet will appear like a faint greenish smudge in the sky while those with a telescope could see the comets dramatic visible tail the Planetary Society said. A bright green glow will be visible to observers in the Northern Hemisphere in the morning sky as the comet moves northwest during the month of January. Those in the Southern Hemisphere will be able to spot it in February NASA said. The comet isnt expected to be as much of a spectacle as the 2020 Comet NEOWISE the brightest comet visible from the Northern Hemisphere since 1997 NASA said. But its still an awesome opportunity to make a personal connection with an icy visitor from the distant outer solar system NASA said. The comet takes about 50000 years to orbit the sun so an opportunity to see it will only come once in a lifetime the Planetary Society said.,2023-01-12T18:47:57Z
79,Disney boss calls for workers to return to office four days a week,From the start of March employees will be asked to be in the office from Monday to Thursday.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64218702,Disney boss tells workers to return to office four days a week Published Disneys boss has told employees who are currently working from home to start going into the office for four days a week from the start of March. Chief executive Bob Iger said socalled hybrid workers will now be asked to treat Monday through Thursday as inperson workdays. He also highlighted his view that facetoface collaboration is key to a creative business like ours. The announcement comes two months after Mr Igers shock return to Disney. Nothing can replace the ability to connect observe and create with peers that comes from being physically together nor the opportunity to grow professionally by learning from leaders and mentors Mr Iger said in a memo to employees seen by the BBC. It is my belief that working together more inperson will benefit the companys creativity culture and our employees careers he added. Return to work Like many other big companies Disney allowed employees to work from home during the pandemic to help slow the spread of Covid19. Also like other major firms Disney has now moved to bring staff back into its offices. In recent months companies including Snap Tesla and Uber have announced similar changes to their their working policies. Since September employees of technology giant Apple have been required to work for three days a week in the firms offices. In November multibillionaire Elon Musk ordered Twitter staff back to the office for 40 hours a week ending the companys permanent work from anywhere policy. The decision by Mr Musk who bought the social media platform in a 44bn 38. 7bn deal reportedly caused large numbers of staff to quit after he called on them to sign up for long hours at high intensity or leave. Igers return Mr Iger was brought back by the companys board to steer it through a tough period after its share price plummeted and the Disney streaming service continued to run at a loss. His return came less than a year after he had retired from the company. He previously headed Disney for 15 years. Mr Iger replaced Bob Chapek who took over as chief executive in February 2020. Mr Chapeks tenure as the boss of Disney included the shutdown of its theme parks due to Covid restrictions.,2023-01-10T04:01:05Z

</li><li>Makiivka: Russia points fingers after deadliest Ukraine a…",https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/sitting-ducks-russian-military-flaws-seen-in-troop-deaths-1.6216821,Sitting ducks Russian military flaws seen in troop deaths The Russian militarys top brass came under increasing scrutiny Wednesday as more details emerged of how at least 89 Russian soldiers and possibly many more were killed in a Ukrainian artillery attack on a single building. The scene last weekend in the Russianheld eastern Ukrainian town of Makiivka where the soldiers were temporarily stationed appears to have been a recipe for disaster. Hundreds of Russian troops were reportedly clustered in a building close to the front line of the war well within range of the enemys Westernsupplied precision artillery possibly sitting close to an ammunition store and perhaps unwittingly helping Kyivs forces to zero in on them. It was one of the deadliest single attacks on the Kremlins forces since the war began more than 10 months ago and the highest death toll in a single incident acknowledged so far by either side in the conflict. Ukraines armed forces claimed the Makiivka strike killed around 400 mobilized Russian soldiers housed in a vocational school building. About 300 more of them were wounded officials alleged. It wasnt possible to verify either sides claims due to the fighting. The Russian military sought to blame the soldiers for their own deaths. Gen. Lt. Sergei Sevryukov said in a statement late Tuesday that their phone signals allowed Kyivs forces to determine the coordinates of the location of military personnel and launch a strike. Emily Ferris a Research Fellow on Russia and Eurasia at the Royal United Services Institute in London told The Associated Press it is very hard to verify whether cellphone signaling and geolocation were to blame for the accurate strike. She noted that Russian soldiers on active duty are forbidden from using their phones exactly because there have been so many instances in recent years of their being used for targeting including by both sides in the Ukraine war. The conflict has made ample use of modern technology. She also noted that blaming the soldiers themselves was a helpful narrative for Moscow as it helps deflect criticism and steer attention toward the official cellphone ban. Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to move the conversation along too as he took part via video link in a sendingoff ceremony Wednesday for a frigate equipped with the Russian navys new hypersonic missiles. Putin said the Zircon missiles that the Admiral Gorshkov frigate was carrying were a unique weapon capable of flying at nine times the speed of sound and with a range of 1000 kilometers 620 miles. Russia says the missiles cant be intercepted. Meanwhile away from the battlefields France said Wednesday it will send Frenchmade AMX10 RC light tanks to Ukraine a first from a Western European country following an afternoon phone call between French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Wednesday. The French presidency didnt say how many tanks would be delivered and when. The NATO member has given Ukraine antitank and air defence missiles and rocket launchers. The weekend Makiivka strike seemed to be the latest blow to the Kremlins military prestige as it struggles to advance the invasion of its neighbor amid a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive. But Ferris the analyst said that there should be a bit of caution around leaning too heavily on this attack as a sign of the Russian armys weakness. As details of the strike have trickled out in recent days some observers detected military sloppiness at the root of so many deaths. U. K. intelligence officials said Wednesday that Moscows unprofessional military practices were likely partly to blame for the high casualties. Given the extent of the damage there is a realistic possibility that ammunition was being stored near to troop accommodation which detonated during the strike creating secondary explosions the U. K. Defence Ministry said on Twitter. In the same post the ministry said the building struck by Ukrainian missiles was little more than 12 kilometres 7. 5 miles from the front line within one of the most contested areas of the conflict in the partially Russianoccupied Donetsk region. The Russian military has a record of unsafe ammunition storage from well before the current war but this incident highlights how unprofessional practices contribute to Russias high casualty rate the update added. The Russian Defence Ministry in a rare admission of losses initially said the strike killed 63 troops. But as emergency crews searched the ruins the death toll mounted. The regiments deputy commander was among the dead. That stirred renewed criticism inside Russia of the way the broader military campaign is being handled by the Ministry of Defence. Vladlen Tatarsky a wellknown military blogger accused Russian generals of demonstrating their own stupidity and misunderstanding of whats going on among the troops where everyone has cellphones. Moreover in places where theres coverage artillery fire is often adjusted by phone. There are simply no other ways Tatarsky wrote in a Telegram post. Others put blamed the decision to station hundreds of troops in one place. The cellphone story is not too convincing military blogger Semyon Pegov wrote. The only remedy is not to house personnel en masse in large buildings. Simply not to house 500 people in one place but spread them across 10 different locations. Unconfirmed reports in Russianlanguage media said the victims were mobilized reservists from the region of Samara in southwestern Russia. The Institute for the Study of War saw in the incident further evidence that Moscow isnt properly utilizing the reservists it began calling up last September. Systemic failures in Russias force generation apparatus continue to plague personnel capabilities to the detriment of Russian operational capacity in Ukraine the think tank said in a report late Tuesday. Ferris of the Royal United Services Institute said the Makiivka strike shows the Russian army is more interested in growing its number of troops not in training them in wartime skills. Thats really how Russia conducts a lot of its warfare by overwhelming the enemy with volume with people she said. The Kremlin view unfortunately is that soldiers lives are expendable. In a grinding battle of attrition Russian forces have pressed their offensive on Bakhmut in Donetsk despite heavy losses. The Wagner Group a private military contractor owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin a millionaire businessman with close ties to Putin has spearheaded the Bakhmut offensive. U. S. intelligence officials have determined that convicts Wagner pulled from prisons accounted for 90 of Russian casualties in fighting for Bakhmut according to a senior administration official who requested anonymity to discuss the finding. The White House said last month that intelligence findings showed Wagner had some 50000 personnel fighting in Ukraine including 40000 recruited convicts. The U. S. assesses that Wagner is spending about US100 million a month in the fight. Kozlowska reported from London. Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report.

Her 88 victories are the most by any player on a single professional tour. Whitworth whose LPGA Tour victories spanned nearly a quartercentury and who became the first woman to earn 1 million on the LPGA died on Christmas Eve her longtime partner said. She was 83. Bettye Odle did not disclose a cause of death saying only that Whitworth died suddenly Saturday night while celebrating with family and friends. Kathy left this worth the way she lived her life loving laugh and creating memories Odle said in a statement released by the LPGA Tour. Whitworth won the first of her 88 titles in the Kelly Girls Opens in July 1962. She won six majors during her career and broke Mickey Wrights record of 82 career wins when Whitworth captured the Lady Michelob in the summer of 1982. Her final victory came in 1985 at the United Virginia Bank Classic. Winning never got old Whitworth once said. All that was missing from her career was the U. S. Womens Open the biggest of the womens majors. Upon being the first woman to surpass 1 million in career earnings in 1981 she said I would have swapped being the first to make a million for winning the Open but it was a consolation which took some of the sting out of not winning. Whitworth was the AP Female Athlete of the Year in 1965 and in 1967 when she easily beat out Wimbledon singles champion Billie Jean King. Whitworth was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1982. She was the LPGA player of the year seven times in an eightyear span 1966 through 1973. She won the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average seven times and she was the leading money winner in eight seasons. But she was identified by one number 88. Snead was credited with a record 82 wins on the PGA Tour a total Woods has since matched. Wright won 82 times on the LPGA Tour while Sorenstam had 72 wins when she retired after the 2006 season at age 36. I think Mickey had the best swing and was probably the greatest golfer Betsy Rawls once told Golf Digest. But Kathy was the best player of the game that I have ever seen. Whitworth was born in Monahans a small West Texas town and learned to play golf in New Mexico. She started at age 15 in Jal New Mexico on the ninehole course built for the El Paso Natural Gas employees. She soon was a twotime winner of the New Mexico State Amateur. After briefly attending Odessa Texas College she turned pro at age 19 and joined the LPGA Tour in December 1958. I was really fortunate in that I knew what I wanted to do Whitworth once told Golf Digest. Golf just grabbed me by the throat. I cant tell you how much I loved it. I used to think everyone knew what they wanted to do when they were 15 years old. Wright had the more aesthetically pleasing swing. Whitworth was all about grinding and about winning. Whitworth won eight times in 1963 and 1965 and she had 11 victories in 1968. In none of those years did she earn more than 50000. All these years later the LPGA Tour total prize fund for 2023 will top 100 million. Whitworth continued to conduct junior clinics and stay active in the game. I dont think about the legacy of 88 tournaments she once said. I did it because I wanted to win not to set a record or a goal that no one else could surpass. Im not some great oddity. I was just fortunate to be so successful. What I did in being a better player does not make me a better person. When Im asked how I would like to be remembered I feel that if people remember me at all it will be good enough.,2022-12-25T21:58:00Z

Its a notice of everything you are going to need to know before you make a flight he told CBC News on Wednesday of the NOTAM system which is communicated to pilots digitally. Are these systems reliable enough and secure enough If it even goes down for an hour or two you can see what happens. More than 1200 flights in the U. S. had been cancelled by 4 p. m. ET Wednesday according to FlightAware a tracking website. More than 8700 flights were delayed following problems with the U. S. NOTAM system which also resulted in a number of Canadian flights to and from the U. S. being disrupted Tuesday and Wednesday. The FAA reported that the NOTAM system failed around 330 p. m. ET Tuesday meaning no new messages about uptodate weather or airport conditions could be processed. The grounding of many flights in the U. S. was lifted around 9 a. m. ET on Wednesday. Problems with the NOTAM system in the U. S. and the ensuing flight cancellations have raised questions about how its designed and whether the underlying digital infrastructure used to communicate information to aviators is up to the job. WATCH Aviation safety expert explains computer system problems When was NOTAM created and how does it work According to the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration FAA the NOTAM system was first established in 1947. NOTAMs must be provided to the pilots of any plane big or small private or commercial before takeoff Pottinger said. Decades ago the latest information was communicated to flight crews in person before departure. The system then became telephone based and pilots would receive a call with updates on conditions. In the last three to four years the NOTAM system was digitized following guidance from the UNs International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO Pottinger said and most updates are sent online. These digital systems arent as robust as they should be in many places including the U. S. the aviation consultant said as evidenced by Wednesdays outage. If they fail that means you are going to have significant delays. Airports and air traffic control regulators and organizations such as the FAA and NAV Canada create the notices that are sent to the system. An airport might include information such as updates about a closed runway or lighting problems Pottinger said. Air traffic regulators provide information on issues like airspace closures or weather hazards en route. This information is made available to pilots airline staff and others in the industry ahead of a flight. What caused the problem Officials with the FAA havent said what specifically went wrong with the NOTAM system. But U. S. officials said they dont believe the outage was related to a cyberattack. U. S. President Joe Biden said he has directed the Department of Transportation to investigate the outage. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN that there would be ripple effects from the mornings delays. Now we have to understand how this could have happened in the first place. Why the usual redundancies that would stop it from being that disruptive did not stop it from being disruptive this time. Was Canada affected NAV Canada the organization responsible for air traffic control in this country reported an outage for new updates to the NOTAM system for a couple of hours midmorning Wednesday but said the problem didnt cause any flight delays. In Canada pilots were still able to read NOTAMs but there was an outage that meant new notices couldnt be entered into the system NAV Canada said on social media. When new information couldnt be added to the platform Pottinger believes Canadian air traffic control officials may have reverted back to phone calls to communicate the latest data to pilots. NAV Canada said it did not believe the outage was related to the one in the U. S. but it said it was investigating. a hrefhttpst. co0Rj5toRmGApic. twitter. com0Rj5toRmGAanavcanada a hrefhttpst. coxLCZ0CVwvzpic. twitter. comxLCZ0CVwvzanavcanada What happens next Problems with the NOTAM system did not put passenger safety at risk Pottinger said but the outage did cause major headaches for travellers and airlines. Some of the digital background architecture underpinning the NOTAM system is pretty old in the U. S. and Canada he said noting that technology glitches likely contributed to the problem. Travel industry officials called on the government to improve the system. Americas transportation network desperately needs significant upgrades Geoff Freeman president of the U. S. Travel Association said in a statement. We call on federal policymakers to modernize our vital air travel infrastructure. Corrections An earlier version of this story referred to NAV Canada as a government body. In fact NAV Canada is a privately run notforprofit corporation that owns and operates Canadas civil air navigation system. Jan 11 2023 1024 PM ET An earlier version of this story also said the UNs International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO regulates the global system. In fact it does not regulate the system but promotes aviation safety by helping to define international operating standards.

S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA placed a rock sample on the surface of Mars on Wednesday marking a historic early step in NASAs Mars Sample Return campaign. The sample was put in a titanium tube. Over the next two months the rover will deposit a total of 10 tubes at the location building humanitys first sample depot on another planet said NASA. Based on the architecture of the Mars Sample Return campaign the rover would deliver samples to a future robotic lander. The lander would in turn use a robotic arm to place the samples in a containment capsule aboard a small rocket that would blast off to Mars orbit where another spacecraft would capture the sample container and return it safely to Earth according to NASA. The depot will serve as a backup if the rover can not deliver its samples. In that case a pair of Sample Recovery Helicopters would be called upon to finish the job said NASA. The Perseverance rover was launched from Florida in July 30 of 2020 and touched down safely on Mars in February 2021. It is the first rover to bring a sample caching system to Mars that will package promising samples for return to Earth by a future mission. A key objective for Perseverances mission on Mars is astrobiology including the search for signs of ancient microbial life.,2022-12-23T02:38:21Z

The books publisher said Spare sold 400000 copies in the U. K. in all formats hardback ebook and audio on its first day. As far as we know the only books to have sold more in their first day are those starring the other Harry Potter said Larry Finlay managing director of Transworld Penguin Random House. The final Potter book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows sold more than 2. 5 million copies on its first day of release in 2007. A few stores in Britain opened at midnight to sell copies to diehard royal devotees and the merely curious. Many said they wanted to form their own opinion of the book after days of snippets and debate on news sites and television. Im excited just to hear about Prince Harrys life from Prince Harry said Sarah Nakana a surveyor who bought the book at Londons Victoria station. Theres so much misinformation disinformation about Harry and Meghan. The books myriad revelations and accusations have already been splashed across the media. In the ghostwritten memoir Harry 38 recounts his grief at the death of his mother Princess Diana his disputes with brother Prince William and frustration at the role of royal spare in the shadow of his elder sibling who is heir to the British throne. He lacerates the U. K. s tabloid press for coverage he considers prurient intrusive and sometimes plain wrong claims his relatives were unwelcoming to his wife Meghan and accuses members of the Royal Family including his stepmother Camilla of leaking stories to the media to burnish their own reputations. Buckingham Palace has not commented on any of the allegations though royal allies have pushed back largely anonymously. Harrys exposure of bitter divides inside the House of Windsor alongside details of his mental health struggles experiences with sex and drugs and decadelong military career has generated reams of media coverage. Spare is the topselling book on Amazons U. K. site and on Amazon. com in the U. S. and is already one of the years biggest sellers. John Cotterill nonfiction buyer at the Waterstones bookstore chain told trade magazine The Bookseller that Spare was one of the biggest preorder titles of the last decade for Waterstones. In the U. S. Barnes Noble issued a statement Tuesday citing an exceptional level of customer interest although the superstore chain did not release any specific numbers. Excitement is far from universal however. Harrys interview with broadcaster ITV drew 4. 1 million viewers on Sunday fewer than the 5. 3 million who watched BBC drama Happy Valley at the same time. Retail worker Caroline Lennon arrived at 6 a. m. Tuesday at a branch of Waterstones in central London to await its opening. I did expect a queue. Unfortunately theres no queue. Im just by myself she said. I want to read it because I like the Royal Family and I dont care what anybody says she said. People will criticize that. I dont care because I like the Royal Family and I like Harry and Meghan. AP National Writer Hillel Italie contributed to this report from New York.

It was not double vision. You did see everything twice including jokes. I myself felt wildeyed and fugitive when I heard that joke about Larry Grayson and the fairy cakes yet again. Or when having laughed in moderation at a Victor Borge joke the one about the elephant being a heavy smoker I found it in my Christmas cracker. A cracker moreover from Taiwan. This thing is that there are simply not enough faces or jokes to go round at a season of such unremitting merriment. They are therefore dispensed somewhat stingily by Sid Stores. Look says Sid batting back the unruly mob of producers each trying surreptitiously to press 50p into his palm Look you can have Terry Wogan if youll take Wanda the Wonder Duck. Thats my last word. Now youll have the Wandsworth Boys Choir again. Sorry no Harry Worth left but you can have Mike Yarwood doing an impression of Ted Heath doing an impression of Harry Worth if you like. If you dont want him theres plenty as will. If you cannot get Tommy Cooper you get a yellow monkey doing an impression of him. You think Im making this up dont you I couldnt. There seemed times at Christmas when I could not switch on without hearing Bruce Forsyth say Havent they done well It is I gather a wellknown catchphrase. Or if it wasnt its well known now. One must take what one can get at Christmas and the celebrity is sometimes only semicelebrated. Now and then the audience fail to recognise the famous face even when he throws off his false red nose and stands revealed. They did recognise Jimmy Edwards because he looks much the same before or after throwing off his nose. To avoid such embarrassment there is a specific form of introduction current at Christmas. Someone has to say warmly or at least loudly Why its Meg Richardson from Crossroads or Of course I remember you. Youre Brian Marshall. The audience may still be slightly at sea but they know a cue for applause when they hear one. Closing my eyes which is not difficult I remember with pleasure The Last Goon Show of All BBC One.

89,"Ghana fishing: Abuse, corruption and death on Chinese vessels",Ghanaian fishermen have told the BBC of widespread abuse on Chinese fishing vessels.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-63720181,Ghana fishing Abuse corruption and death on Chinese vessels Published When it comes to abuse and corruption on Chinese fishing vessels in Ghana Bright Tsai Kweku has seen it all. He has seen Chinese crew treating local fishermen like slaves he says. They beat them they spit on them they kick them Mr Kweku says. I have been through that before. Mr Kweku works as a bosun an officer in charge of equipment and the crew. He says he has been forced to work for three days without sleep had food withheld from him and been forced to drink dirty water. The fate of some of his fellow fishermen has been even worse he says. Mr Kweku says one of his colleagues fell sick with cholera on board a Chinese vessel but the crew refused to bring him back to shore for treatment. He didnt make it back alive. He saw another get badly burned on a vessel after a fire ignited onboard. Another colleague got caught by a propeller. Neither survived and the families have not received proper compensation he says. These are just a few examples of the alleged widespread abuse and neglect linked to Chinese fishing vessels operating off Ghanaian shores. The UKbased Environmental Justice Foundation EJF says at least 90 of the industrial trawlers operating in Ghana are owned by Chinese corporations in contravention of Ghanaian laws on the ownership of vessels fishing under the local flag. A substantial proportion of these vessels have engaged in illegal practices EJF says. A recent EJF report investigates what it says are illegal unreported and unregulated fishing and human rights abuses by Chinas Distant Water Fishing DWF fleet in Ghana. The ownership and operational control of Chinas DWF fleet is complex and opaque and is the largest in the world. All 36 crew members interviewed by EJF had been forced to work more than 14 hours a day and received inadequate food. 94 had received inadequate medicine or witnessed verbal abuse 86 reported inadequate living conditions 81 had witnessed physical abuse 75 had seen serious injury at sea. In response Chinas embassy says it is a responsible fishing country. We have always worked with other members of the international community to crack down on illegal unreported and unregulated fishing and have done a lot in effectively combating illegal fishing its press office tells the BBC. One of the worst disasters involving a Chinese vessel in Ghanaian waters took place eight months ago. On 6 May the MV Comforter 2 sank in stormy conditions. Fourteen crew were rescued but 11 remain missing presumed dead including the stateappointed observer. The body of the Chinese captain was found. One of the survivors who requested anonymity and we will call Michael recalls the horrors that unfolded that day. Despite storms getting increasingly worse he says the Chinese crew told the fishermen to pull in an excessive haul in one go. The boat already had a lot of fish on board and it lost control capsizing under the weight of the haul and the choppy waters. Michael and nine others managed to grab hold of a floating oil drum for almost 24 hours before a fisherman found them. It was a terrifying night he says. We didnt know whether we would make it or not. Michael hasnt recovered physically or mentally from the disaster and says the Ghanaian company officially in charge of the vessel Boatacom has not paid him any compensation. Im not happy at all the company keeps giving us excuses. Sometimes I feel pain all over my body. I need medical attention but I dont have money he says. Kojo Ampratwum managing director of Boatacom tells the BBC the firm has submitted its reports to the insurance company and is waiting to hear back. Tracing who owns the MV Comforter 2 and other vessels operating in Ghana is complicated. Foreign ownership of industrial trawl vessels operating under the Ghanaian flag is illegal but some Chinese firms get around this via Ghanaian front companies. Through its research EJF says the Chinese Dalian Mengxin Ocean Fishery Company is the ultimate owner of the MV Comforter 2 and that it is part of the Meng Xin fleet. The Meng Xin fleet has also been linked to one of the most notorious cases on Ghanaian waters in recent times the disappearance of fisheries observer Emmanuel Essien. Since 2018 Ghana has appointed fisheries observers on board all industrial trawlers operating under the Ghanaian flag. Their job is to collect data on fishing activities and report on illegal practices at sea. Essien had earned a name as a dedicated and thorough observer but this had led to problems. He got into a fight with a Chinese national who had stopped him from filming crew illegally discarding fish at sea says his brother James Essien. Emmanuels final report to the Fisheries Commission was on 24 June 2019. In the report a copy of which was provided to the BBC he outlines illegal fishing activities and states I humbly plead with the police to investigate further. On 5 July Essien went missing from the Meng Xin 15 trawler. James says that his brother had dinner with the rest of the crew before they headed back to their cubicle to sleep. The next morning he was nowhere to be seen. More than three years on the family still has no answers. A police investigation found no signs of violence or anything incriminating. I want the truth to come out James tells the BBC in tears. The Mengxin Ocean Fishery Company could not be reached for comment. Essiens disappearance is one of many factors that have had a chilling effect on Ghanas fisheries observers. Ghanaian observers who spoke to the BBC explain how a culture of fear corruption and neglect are pushing them to take bribes to bury evidence of illegal fishing and abuse on Chinese vessels. Most of our colleagues are taking money says one observer who requested anonymity and we will call Daniel. They are being bribed and taking money from the Chinese and submitting reports to the ministry that are not true. All the observers interviewed say their wages are poor and it often takes as long as five months to get paid meaning kickbacks from Chinese and Ghanaian crew managers are necessary to feed their families. If you reject the bribe you go home hungry says another observer who we will call Samuel. Most of those observers do take bribes. Thats what we do to take care of our families. Some feel too scared to report the truth. Sometimes what they do is throw the observer into the water it has happened before Samuel says. Because of the fear we normally dont report issues like that. One former observer who has since left Ghana tells the BBC he was once called to the office of a highranking official within the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development after he reported illegal practices at sea. He says the official asked him to present the evidence and then proceeded to delete it from his phone. But he had the evidence backed up on a laptop and threatened to post it on social media. Then he says he started receiving threats. At one point he was so nervous that he would not sleep at his own house because people knew where he lived and he was worried about being attacked or worse. One day when he was cycling near the fishing harbour in Tema a port city east of the capital Accra he says a Ghanaian official spotted him and tried ramming him with his vehicle. He was trying to hit me with his car at the fishing harbour. I saw him so I jumped to the gutter this guy was mad he says. He eventually decided to leave the industry after receiving death threats. I became miserable in life because when Id go to the harbour everyone was looking at me. I couldnt find any work to do. I became like a stranger like Im a bad person. It was so hard for me. He now avoids the harbour when hes back in Ghana. People try to threaten me. These guys are very serious he says. Steve Trent founder and head of EJF says the high concentration of Chinese ownership within trawl fleets is a problem across West Africa accusing them of often flouting the law. But in Ghana the problem is particularly acute he says. These Chinese owners have commonly put a Chinese captain in charge of the vessels to command the mainly Ghanaian crew and it is these Chinese captains that have driven the abuse Mr Trent says. He blames the abuse on the owners seeking to maximise profits and minimise costs. EJF investigations have uncovered systemic corruption at virtually every level and including fisheries officials police and navy officers tasked with enforcing regulations he says. While there has been some progress on illegal fishing in Ghana Mr Trent says a lot more needs to be done. We need to see the loopholes and deceit by which illegal foreign ownership now concentrated with the Chinese are eliminated he says. The Ghanaian government did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Mr Kweku wants the government to allow fishermen to properly unionise and says a system must be put in place so people are under contract before being sent out to work at sea. A mixture of abuse disappearances and poor pay has taken a lasting toll on his mental health and that of many others. We lost a lot of fishermen at sea but nothing is done about that. Two or three observers are missing he says. We are all afraid of going to sea but there is no work on land so you must force yourself to go.,2023-01-04T02:11:58Z
90,Why reporting on Iran comes at a heavy price,"BBC Persian journalists are trolled and harassed on a daily basis, and their families persecuted.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64222261,Why reporting on Iran comes at a heavy price Published In Iran the antigovernment protests of 2022 have continued into the new year. Reporting on one of the biggest international stories of the moment is an ongoing challenge for BBC Persian Service journalists who are not allowed into the country suffer daily harassment and whose families back home are persecuted. Iran has been in turmoil since September when the death in custody of 22yearold Mahsa Amini sparked mass protests against the compulsory hijab and other restrictions leading to calls for regime change. It has meant working around the clock for BBC Persian journalists. But reporting on events in Iran is not just a logistical challenge it also has serious personal ramifications. The harassment it triggers from the Iranian government creates consequences for the lives of the journalists. In October 2022 the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement naming BBC Persian in a list of individuals and organisations sanctioned for what it called their deliberate actions in support of terrorism and inciting violence and hate speech and human rights abuses. BBC Persian journalists have received online death threats and threats of horrific violence and thousands of orchestrated abusive comments. Family members in Iran have also reported increased and severe harassment including being summoned for interrogations and being threatened because their family members continue to work for the BBC. Journalists have also been harassed by those who feel that the policy of reflecting the Iranian governments own account of events as part of the coverage gives a platform to the regimes supporters. In a new BBC documentary Reporting Iran Inside BBC Persian one correspondent Jiyar Gol is filmed being harangued by antigovernment demonstrators in Berlin shouting Ayatollah BBC. Do you know how many members of my family are in prison now Jiyar replies. In the case of lead presenter Rana Rahimpour when her conversation with family back in Iran was wiretapped with sections edited together to make it seem as though she supported the government and published it was seized upon by critics as more evidence that the BBCs impartiality equates to collaboration with the government. The pressure on her from the Iranian government has even forced her to warn her childrens school to be extra cautious about their safety. In the heart of BBC Persians newsroom in London as the team covers news of the uprising in Iran BBC journalists are not allowed to work in Iran so they rely on social media to find out and verify what is happening on the ground. With the recent protests it became an essential tool. For instance when journalists hear that a protester has been killed the first thing they usually do is check that persons social media accounts for followers with the same last name. When relatives reply information they share can be crosschecked with other sources such as death certificates and coroners reports. During major stories such as this one the BBCs job is not just to report on events but to sort disinformation from genuine evidence. Online mapping tools are used to geolocate footage that has been sent frame by frame to check whether or not it is actually from the town or city journalists have been told it has been filmed in. They look for shops which may have changed in that time for example or even weather which does not match what we know of the forecast that day. Journalists have to apply the same verification methods to Iranian state TV reports. One broadcast in recent months tried to prove that 16yearold protester Nika Shakarami had fallen off the roof of a building and that she had not as her family said been killed by security forces. The report showed a woman her face obscured but dressed in black clothes similar to Nikas entering the building which the authorities claimed Nika fell from. In this case two things stood out not only was this woman walking calmly whereas Nika had reportedly told a friend she was being chased by security forces but it was noted that a cat in the background of the video was also walking calmly. If this were Nika who had been involved in loud noisy protests fired on by tear gas then you would expect to see the cat running from the chaos. On one occasion one of the sources sending me information was arrested and then released by the Iranian security forces. When she then got back in touch with me via a messaging app how could I trust that this was now not in fact the authorities corresponding with me posing as her So I asked her to send me a voice note so I could be sure. Because these sources are traumatised by their experiences they correspond with BBC journalists day and night who must always be ready to respond. And all of this while dealing with their own fractured family ties. The BBC Persian service Part of the BBC World Service it broadcasts in Persian. The channel is banned in Iran as are the journalists but people there can see it via satellite digital platforms and radio it reaches 18. 5 million viewers every week in Iran and around the world. Irans officials will not be interviewed by BBC Persian but the service reflects the governments account of events as part of its coverage. It is often referred to as Ayatollah BBC by some Iranian opposition who accuse it of playing a role in bringing the clerical establishment to power 43 years ago and of siding with the Iranian regime. Its journalists assets in the country have been frozen since 2017 and their families interrogated and in some cases detained. In the BBC documentary on the Persian service lead presenter Farnaz Ghazizadeh talks about the recent death after a sudden illness of her father in Iran and how her grief was compounded by the guilt that she had not been able to spend a lot of time with him in the past 18 years. The most difficult thing is not dealing with the future but dealing with a past when he was alive she says. When I decided to join the BBC I didnt realise that I was making a decision not just for myself but for many people. And now I keep asking myself Did I have the right to make that decision Is it worth it She was also unable to visit her brother on his death bed last year. And at the same time she was having to endure trolling by opponents of the regime after an article resurfaced she had been commissioned to write about Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for an Iranian newspaper 22 years ago when she was still in the country. My 45yearold brother was on his death bed and I couldnt be there for him and my parents. And I was being called a regime apologist online Farnaz says. Lives can be changed forever as a result of simply being related to someone who works for BBC Persian. In my case my brother was forced out of an excellent job for Irans oil ministry. For my colleague Jiyar Gol it means never having the chance to introduce his young daughter to his relatives. And as for the staff last year four UN independent experts on Iran raised their grave concern over the regimes harassment and intimidation of those who work for BBC Persian.,2023-01-12T00:16:25Z
91,Iran protests: Activist Narges Mohammadi details 'abuse' of detained women,Narges Mohammadi writes to the BBC with fellow inmates' accounts of physical and sexual abuse.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-64084709,Iran protests Activist Narges Mohammadi details abuse of detained women Published A leading human rights activist in Iran has written from prison to give the BBC details of how women detained in recent antigovernment protests are being sexually and physically abused. Narges Mohammadi said such assaults had become more common in recent protests. She is serving a lengthy sentence in Tehrans notorious Evin prison. The protests were triggered by the death in custody in September of 22yearold Mahsa Amini arrested for violating strict dress codes. She was detained by morality police in midSeptember for allegedly wearing her hijab or headscarf improperly. More than 500 protesters including 69 children have been killed while thousands of others have been arrested human rights activists say. Dozens of Iranian security personnel are also reported to have been killed. Many of those arrested have allegedly been subjected to torture and other illtreatment in custody. Ms Mohammadi is deputy head of Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadis Defenders of Human Rights Center. She has received several jail sentences since 2011 and is currently in prison for spreading propaganda. This year she was also included in the BBCs 100 Women a high profile list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world. Prominent political prisoners in Iran like Ms Mohammadi who are not in solitary confinement are often able to communicate with the outside world via their families or fellow activists. Hands and legs tied to hook Ms Mohammadi says in her letter that some of the women arrested during the recent demonstrations were transferred to the womens ward in Evin prison. That gave her a chance to hear shocking details of the abuse they suffered. She says that one wellknown activist had her hands and legs tied to a hook above her head in the vehicle taking her to prison and was then sexually assaulted by security officers. Ms Mohammadi says she saw bruises and scars on her body. She says another woman who was arrested in the street was taken on a motorbike by two security officers one in front and one behind and was repeatedly assaulted. Irans state broadcaster has denied reports of security forces using rape and sexual abuse against female protesters. A report on 19 December said female prisoners were kept in facilities run by allfemale staff adding that claims of rape in the Western media were rumours and baseless. But Iran also continues to heavily repress domestic reporting of the protests with one recent report suggesting it was now the third largest jailer of journalists in the world. Ms Mohammadi says that even though reporting abuse may lead to intimidation of the families of women in detention she believes its necessary to expose whats happening in order to try to put a stop to it. Not revealing these crimes would contribute to the continuation of application of this repressive methods against women she says. Therefore it seems that the assault on women activists fighters and protesters in Iran should be widely and powerfully reported at the global level. She added that this was especially important given the pressure on civil society in Iran. In the absence of powerful independent civil organisations the attention and support of the media and international human rights organisations and global public opinion is essential she said. Ms Mohammadi ended the letter by expressing the belief that Irans brave resilient lively and hopeful women would attain victory. Victory means establishing democracy peace and human rights and ending tyranny she added. We will not back down.,2022-12-24T08:26:31Z

94,Fatphobia: The Brazil women fighting prejudices,Campaigners in Brazil say society must adapt to accommodate overweight and obese people.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-63950286,Fatphobia The Brazil women fighting prejudices Published Rayane Souza used to struggle taking the local bus in Vitria the capital of the Brazilian state of Esprito Santo 480km 300 miles north of Rio de Janeiro. Aged 14 having got stuck in the bus turnstile yet again and feeling the eyes of the rest of the passengers on her she vowed never to take this form of public transport again. Ive been fat my whole life. I became used to hearing rude comments about my weight she said. Ms Souzas experience is not unique. Another Brazilian woman recently got stuck in a turnstile on a bus for more than four hours. In the end firefighters had to be called to free her. A few passengers tried to help her but she said others posted embarrassing pictures of her on social media. While studying at university Ms Souza suffered similar humiliation on social media after already having been teased and bullied at school about her weight. I was the victim of bullying of fatphobia. All the students made a WhatsApp group and they took my photos that I published on my social networks in that group and started to make fun of me. That was a watershed moment for Ms Souza. Rather than retreating into her shell she decided she was not going to be intimidated. She decided to set up a campaigning group with fellow law graduate Mariana Oliveira. They called it Gorda na lei the Portuguese for Fat in the law. It aims to advise people of their legal rights if they are discriminated against because of their weight. They receive around 70 messages per month from people who want compensation or simply to share their story. Accepting different body shapes Brazil might be known for the stereotype of the tanned beachready body but the reality is that like in much of the developed world more than half of the population is overweight with a quarter medically obese. Campaigners argue society should accept this. They say Brazil is amongst the countries leading the world in successfully forcing through policy changes to accommodate different body shapes. According to official statistics there are more than 1400 open cases mentioning fatphobia just in Brazilian employment tribunals. Even though fatphobia is not a specific crime it can be pursued under existing legal categories such as libel slander and moral harassment explains Ms Oliveira who is now a human rights lawyer. She mentions one particular case in which a business owner made it a condition of paying a bonus to one of his employees that she lost weight. He even made her hop on a scale Ms Oliveira says. The judge ruled in the employees favour and set reparations at R10000 1900 1585 one of the highest amounts registered in Brazil involving a fatphobia case but still a small sum compared to other decisions in the Brazilian judicial system. One of the places in Brazil where policy change has been made is in the city of Recife. A bill passed by its council last year obliges schools to have bigger desks. Recifes councilwoman Cida Pedrosa was the key mover in introducing the new legislation A lot of the stories that Id heard were of people who were humiliated because they couldnt fit behind a school desk. The new law passed by Ms Pedrosa means every school in Recife has a bigger desk in each of the rooms. Ms Pedrosa rejects the suggestion that making these changes means abandoning efforts to make obese and overweight Brazilians lose weight. Were not denying that in some cases being obese can bring health problems. But we also have to stop pathologizing fat bodies and thinking that fat bodies are sick. There is no national campaign in Brazil to encourage people to lose weight in part because health professionals cannot agree on how to get the message across without stigmatizing people who are overweight. Many Brazilian doctors believe patients who are overweight should be told straight that they need to lose weight. Lucia Cordero a specialist who treats many obese patients at her clinic in Recife agrees that this condition can lead to a catalogue of health conditions. We know that a higher BMI leads to more mortality heart attacks strokes she says. According to Ms Cordero sleep apnoea where a patients breathing stops and starts during sleep is also a huge problem as are diabetes and cancer. But Ms Cordero insists that a more sensitive approach is needed. Obesity is a disease. We have to tell society to try to live a healthy life but we need to be careful with how we send the message so it doesnt transform into prejudice into fatphobia.

95,Brazil Congress riot: Conditions of detainees come under scrutiny,"About 1,000 people are still being held and questioned in connection with the 8 December riots.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-64228532,Brazil Congress riot Conditions of detainees come under scrutiny Published At a police academy in the lush green outskirts of Brazils capital hundreds of people are anxiously waiting to learn their fate with the grim prospect of a prison sentence looming over them. The detainees inside are among more than 1500 people taken into custody following the riot at Brazils Congress on 8 January which authorities have blamed on rightwing supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro. Mounting concerns over the conditions inside the facility as well as rumours and disinformation running rampant on social media have prompted an outcry from some conservative Brazilian politicians. In yet another similarity with the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol and its aftermath some are now calling for an investigation into the detentions to be launched. The BBC was not allowed inside the facility on Tuesday. But officials have repeatedly defended their handling of the detainees and there has been no evidence to suggest that the worst of the allegations are based in reality. Images posted to social media purport to offer a glimpse of what the detainees face inside rows of people sleeping on a crowded and dirty gymnasium floor allegedly with limited access to food and water. Telma Viera an ardent Bolsonaro supporter who visited two friends held inside told the BBC that while staff inside the facility whom she called fellow patriots were doing their best to take care of the detainees the makeshift nature of the facility meant that conditions were difficult. They can do nothing for the people who are there including old people and children. They are just camping there with sick people she said. They the detainees are doing what they can setting up tents praying she added. Some have had people bring them little things from home but mostly they are praying and thanking God for each others help. Concerns over the conditions at the facility have been amplified by the rapid spread of false information on social media platforms such as TikTok and Twitter. Late on Monday for example Brazils Federal Police were forced to publicly dispel a rumour which had already been shared hundreds of thousands of times that a 77yearold woman had died inside. The social media posts havent escaped the attention of conservative lawmakers several of whom attempted to enter the facility on Tuesday. Neucimar Fraga a congressman from the rightwing Progressitas Party said rumours have reached Congress via social media requiring a response from politicians. This includes mistreatment a lack of food as well as inadequate room to sleep and inadequate bathroom breaks. Some people were here 36 hours before their first meal he alleged. Ive heard of detainees of 90 years old people who could not physically cause any harm to Brazil. We need to check what is fact he added. As opposed to what is rumours. To do so Mr Fraga and other lawmakers have said they hope to form a commission to examine the arrests and the condition in which detainees have been held. We have a constitutional right to this information and thats a process that needs to happen quickly he added. Thats why we are here. Of the approximately 1500 people arrested and brought to the police academy after the riot officials say that nearly 600 have been taken to other facilities where police officials have five days to formally charge them. Just over 520 people have so far been released some of whom shouted messages of continued defiance from buses as they were driven away from the academy on Tuesday. Our fight against Red Communism will never rest an elderly man yelled from the back of the bus alongside several women waving Brazilian flags. On Monday thousands of Brazilians took to the streets of cities across the country with many participants expressly condemning the rioters and calling on the full force of the law to be brought to bare on them.

96,Jamie Oliver calls for expansion of free school meals in England,"Tory ex-chancellor George Osborne also suggests free meals for ‘larger group of the population is the right way forward’Jamie Oliver has renewed pressure on the government to expand free school meals, with George Osborne suggesting widening the programme coul…",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/dec/27/jamie-oliver-calls-for-expansion-of-free-school-meals,Jamie Oliver has renewed pressure on the government to expand free school meals with George Osborne suggesting widening the programme could be the right way forward and Tony Blair saying the money could be found if politicians wanted to do it. The television chef highlighted the issue as he was guestediting BBC Radio 4s Today programme on Tuesday as part of his longterm campaign on free school meals. Speaking on the programme Osborne a Conservative former chancellor criticised the current Tory dance on the issue. While stopping short of supporting Olivers campaign he said The overall objective which is having better fed healthier kids is a good one I certainly support and it may well be in my mind Im not active in politics today that providing for better free school meals for a much larger group of the population is the right way forward. Referring to the footballer Marcus Rashfords successful campaign to get free school meals extended to the holidays during the Covid pandemic Osborne added Certainly I think the current kind of Tory dance of like no no no and then footballer jumps up and says yes and they go all right is not a good one politically for my party. He also suggested the government needed to do more to tackle obesity with an expansion of sugar taxes. Asked what approach he would take if he was still in government he said I would extend the sugar levy to nonsugary products. And I would actually go ahead with that ban on advertising because I think thats been wellversed now for many years and I think would be a good thing. At the moment only the lowest income households get free school meals. Children of parents who are on universal credit and have an annual income of no more than 7400 or are on another benefit such as jobseekers allowance are eligible for free school meals. There is also still controversy over free school meals during the holidays. In 2020 Rashford called for the government to extend its 15 free school meal vouchers initially set up to feed children in term time when schools were closed by the pandemic into the holidays. Johnson and his then chancellor Rishi Sunak dug their heels in and refused only to be forced into a humiliating Uturn each time after waves of criticism. However since then councils across England have been quietly axing holiday food voucher schemes. Blair said it was possible to find the money for free school meals and people would accept that investment in childrens future was critical. The former Labour prime minister said it was important particularly today when the pressures on families are enormous and when there are levels of poverty that we really havent seen in the country for a long period of time. For the sums of money youre going to spend on early years if you really have the will to do it I promise you having been in government you could find the money necessary to do this Blair added. He urged Oliver to do it as you did it before which is to sit down with political leaders from both political parties and get them to make the commitments. The government did not put forward a government minister for the programme. A Department for Education spokesperson later said We understand the pressures many households are under that is why we are supporting more children and young people than ever before. Over a third of pupils in England currently receive free school meals in education settings and we have just announced a further investment in the national school breakfast programme extending the programme for another year backed by up to 30m. We have acted on soaring energy costs through the energy price guarantee saving a typical household over 900 this winter. The energy bills support scheme is also providing a 400 discount to millions of households this winter further support is available for the most vulnerable who will receive 1200 each this year.,2022-12-27T12:08:29Z
97,Australia football violence: 'My heart sank after highs of World Cup',A chaotic pitch invasion in Melbourne prompts questions - and fears - for the sport in Australia.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-64035076,Australia football violence My heart sank after highs of World Cup Published Australian football has been plunged into turmoil this week following violence at a derby match between two of its biggest clubs. Melbourne City goalkeeper Thomas Glover was left with blood streaming down his face after he was allegedly struck with a metal bucket during a pitch invasion by fans on Saturday. In a few chaotic moments the warm glow cast by Australias heroic World Cup campaign in which the Socceroos reached the last 16 had faded. It was just sickening. I was appalled Francis Awaritefe the chair of Professional Footballers Australia told the BBC. My heart sank because after the highs of the World Cup where the Australian team performed so well and brought the country together it was just really sad. What had started as a protest by fans against a decision to undo tradition and relocate to Sydney the grand finals of the national mens and womens competitions descended into an uncontrolled melee at AAMI Park as Melbourne Victory took on rivals Melbourne City. The match was abandoned and the inquest quickly began. What we all witnessed on Saturday night can only be described as horrific and conduct that is not consistent with the values of Australian football nor the expectations of our community said James Johnson the head of Football Australia the governing body. Both sets of fans had been hurling flares on to the pitch. The situation appeared to escalate when City keeper Glover picked a flare off the turf and threw it back into the stand where Victorys most fervent supporters had gathered. It appeared to ignite the frenzy. Dozens of people poured on to the ground in a wave of disorder that has rarely if ever been seen at a football match in Australia. Two security guards and a TV camera operator were also injured and referee Alex King was also struck by a bucket. Arrests have already been made and more could follow. The game cannot try to spin its way out of this Mr Awaritefe says. If there are fringe elements that are attaching themselves to the game we need to roundly reject these people. Then weve got to use law enforcement to make sure that these people are weeded out. Former Socceroo Craig Foster told Australian television that the sports reputation had been stained. Its shameful and its embarrassing and its a moment that comes after an incredible month for the game he said. Its been on this huge high literally hundreds of thousands of fans getting together at live sites all around the country and watching the Socceroos and that togetherness and that unity was so beautiful. And then to see this its kind of like going from heaven to hell for a moment. The game is in damage control but noone knows what the longerterm consequences might be. Melbourne Victory is facing sanctions because of the behaviour of a minority of its fans. The club could be fined stripped of competition points or forced to play matches behind closed doors. Football in Australia boasts unrivalled participation by girls boys and adults but at an elite level it lags behind the rugby codes Australian Rules football and cricket. Arguably Australia has never really embraced its national football competition. The ALeague replaced the National Soccer League and kicked off its inaugural season in 2005. It has 12 teams 11 from Australia and one from New Zealand. Its played in the summer to avoid fixture clashes with most of the other heavyweights but average attendances are well below 10000. Saturdays scenes in Melbourne could stoke further disenchantment at the grassroots. The ALeague has been on a downward spiral for a while. Prior to the World Cup the game was struggling here a bit even though its the highest participation sport explained Simon Cox president of North Sydney United a thriving amateur club with 1700 members. He told the BBC that the violence was a reminder of the bad old days when football in Australia was divided along ethnic lines drawn between migrant communities whod imported their sporting hostilities from Europe. Not only does it bring back memories for those that followed the old National Soccer League and its tribalism which triggered bouts of bad behaviour it is behaviour we thought wed gone past. But it seems to be rearing its ugly head again Mr Cox said. Its not going to encourage families to go along which is what the ALeague is desperate for. But next year Australia has the chance to show the world its affinity and zest for the game. In July and August 2023 it cohosts the Womens World Cup with New Zealand. Australias Matildas the national team that includes superstar Sam Kerr and their supporters will be craving the sort of homegrown success enjoyed by Englands Lionesses at this years European Championships. The Matildas in terms of their image and womens football generally is massively on the up here said Mr Awaritefe a former Socceroo. Hopefully that will help to bring the country together and to heal some of the wounds that we have suffered in the last few days because of the appalling behaviour of a few.,2022-12-20T05:13:53Z

In 2015 she launched the Instagram account thegreatwomenartists to increase the profile of female and gendernonconforming artists worldwide it now has more than 300000 followers and she hosts a podcast of the same name. Hessel has written and presented arts documentaries for the BBC and her debut book The Story of Art Without Men published by Hutchinson Heinemann celebrates female artists from the past 500 years. It has just been named Waterstones book of the year. 1. Place Niki de Saint Phalles Tarot Garden in Garavicchio Tuscany This is an incredible glittering sculpture park in the middle of Tuscany that hardly anyone knows about. The FrenchAmerican artist Niki de Saint Phalle worked on it for the last three decades of her life and its full of these giant tarot figures covered in mirrored mosaics. I went there a few years ago but Im going back in January. Its sculpture park paradise. 2. Book The Scent of Flowers at Night by Lela Slimani I read an advance copy of this book out in April by the author of Lullaby and its brilliant. Its partly a memoir about writing a bit like Deborah Levys living autobiographies which are my favourite books. Slimani talks about addiction to writing the power of words and what words can do. She writes brilliantly about the sacrifices that you have to make in order to complete a book. 3. Art Lynette YiadomBoakye Fly in League With the Night Tate Britain Ive seen this exhibition three times already and also when it was at the Tate in 2020. It was amazing to revisit it two years on when the world is in a completely different place and all of us are too. I saw YiadomBoakyes figures slightly differently this time they seemed more contemplative and deep in thought. Initially I thought they were more performative. YiadomBoakye is a master storyteller. I love artists who construct this other world for us. 4. Theatre Orlando at the Garrick theatre London This new stage version of Virginia Woolfs Orlando stars Emma Corrin in the title role who was completely wondrous and transfixing. It follows an individual through time from the 16th to the 20th century and explores gender and time and society. It made me think about the treatment of women over those 400 years. I found it really joyous it was like going to a party full of amazing costume changes. 5. Restaurant Dorian Notting Hill London I went one Friday night recently to this restaurant called Dorian in Notting Hill and bumped into a load of friends. Its so good. Ive seen it described as an elevated British bistro and wine bar but the food is a total mix. We shared lots of plates ribeye steak turbot beef tartare crab rsti liver parfait. The chefs kept coming over and giving us wonderful things to eat. It was such fun. 6. Film The South Korean film Decision to Leave was a bit like being in a giant surrealist painting with weird closeups of fish and an ending where they made the sea look like a monster. It was such a captivating and a painterly film and the storyline about a detective investigating a suspicious death and getting obsessed with the victims wife was gripping. But I loved it most for the visuals. It sort of reminded me of Dal. 7. Fashion Bella Freud suit I just bought my first Bella Freud suit three piece darkblue and doublebreasted corduroy. It feels kind of rocknroll but so elegant as well. I saw Bella Freud in conversation the other night with the artist Celia Paul who used to sit for Bellas father Lucian Freud. It was really interesting to hear them speak about what it was like to sit for a painter in a painting you know so well. I wore the suit to the talk. I love the idea that this fashion designer has an art history connection that she brings to her clothes.,2022-12-31T15:00:20Z

According to the Telegraph they eat anything and attack humans and local press in Scotland refers to them as a farmland pest that fights back. Farming unions have told the BBC that the animals are frequently seen killing and eating sheep though there has been little evidence of this. In the UK a naturedepleted country where one is unlikely to stumble on a wild animal larger than a squirrel in most areas it is perhaps unsurprising that the appearance of wild pigs has caused so much fear and loathing. But speaking to those in the Highlands where the populations are tells a different story. Boar became extinct in the UK hundreds of years ago as a result of hunting and habitat degradation. Populations have been reestablished most notably in the Forest of Dean where they are a draw for nature enthusiasts who particularly enjoy seeing their humbugstriped young and for hunters. The creatures were first confirmed to be roaming Scotland in the early 00s thought to have either escaped from private collections or been deliberately released by guerrilla rewilders. Now their population is estimated by some to be about 5000 and they breed very successfully. This means it is very unlikely they will be eradicated from Scotlands landscape any time soon. When a crofter working on Steve Micklewrights Highlands estate first saw a large tusked creature looming up out of the dark he was terrified. But the wild pigs have since been welcomed by Micklewright and his estate workers and tenants who have found them relatively easy to coexist with. We were surprised when they appeared on our estate he said but weve grown to appreciate them. He has found them scary. They can be quite frightening if you come across them. Ive come across them in enclosed areas and theyve been fine they havent done anything. But they are quite scary particularly if they have young. Unless a mother is protecting her young it is extremely unusual for them to attack. In other parts of Europe its just taken for granted that they are out there there are very few cases where they hurt people. Micklewright runs the woodland charity Trees for Life and says he has been pleasantly surprised by the impact the boar have had on his woods. In woodlands they do an amazing job. They rootle around they disturb the ground they make it more diverse and in more of a natural state he said. Though they can cause hassle on agricultural land by digging it up he said the cat is out of the bag in Scotland when it comes to wild boar so they need to be managed properly and shot under licence if causing nuisance. Scotland should bite the bullet on this recognise them as a native species give them the protections a native species has and give those who have a problem with wild boar the ability to manage them properly he said. At the moment people can just go out and shoot them. They need intelligent management. As time goes on and the population increases there is a huge opportunity for sustainable hunting. In Italy for example there is a whole culture of sustainable boar hunting over there. He said they could be enjoyed as a wild food and become a Scottish delicacy like venison. Hugh Raven who for years has managed estates in Scotland lives near some wild boar that have recently arrived near his family estate in the Highlands. He said that although he loves the idea of having them policy needs to be developed so there is local consent. My own feeling is that they will only survive in Scotland in the long term if there is public consent for them he said. That includes being able to control them if they are causing too much damage. Otherwise public opinion will be turned against them. There are enough people in Scotland who own and know how to use rifles that the population could easily be exterminated if there is not public consent. The lurid warnings about attacks on humans have been overblown he added. I have never heard of them hurting anyone but I have heard of someone in the Black Forest in Germany who was chased by a female boar and had to climb up a tree. The idea of them attacking humans is highly improbable. There needs to be a public information campaign as there is a widespread misapprehension about their behaviours. Chantal Lyons an environmental science policy expert who is writing a book on wild boar has been studying their interactions with humans around the Forest of Dean. She said boar were less dangerous than many pet dogs. Wild boar have now been back in the UK for more than 30 years and we have just two recorded incidents of injury she said. The injuries were minor one was some bruising after being charged by a female sow and the other was a man who had a fingertip pad bitten off. It would be good to have boar back more widely she said as they are ecosystem engineers that can breathe life back into our woodlands. By rooting boar can break up monocultures like bracken create more favourable soil conditions and allow a greater diversity of vegetation to grow. In the Forest of Dean I sometimes notice oak seedlings growing in old boar rootings and I wonder if jays have planted them there because the soil is so good so easy to plant acorns in. Boars will not rampage around eating sheep she said. They will certainly eat sheep they find dead as they are omnivorous and enthusiastic carrioneaters. However I think it is extremely unlikely that they have actively killed sheep which are big animals I suspect they were already dead. If the sheepkilling was happening with the frequency it appears to from the claims made youd think someone wouldve been able to get footage of it by now.,2022-12-30T12:32:48Z
