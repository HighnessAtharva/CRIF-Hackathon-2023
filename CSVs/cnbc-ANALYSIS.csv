If youll recall the JFK8 facility in Staten Island became the first unionized Amazon warehouse after workers voted 23501912 in favor of joining a union back in April 2022. Amazon said at the time that it was disappointed with the result and challenged the vote alleging inappropriate and undue influence from the NLRB. The Wall Street Journal says the eretailer also accused Amazon Labor Union organizers of threatening employees to vote in favor of unionization. Overstreet however has ruled that the company was unable to present sufficient proof of inappropriate conduct to overturn the elections results. He agreed with the labor board hearing officer who recommended in September that JFK8s union vote should be upheld. In a tweet ALU president Christian Smalls celebrated being certified by Region 28 NLRB. He added that the union beat Amazon fair and square and tagged Amazon CEO Andy Jassy asking him to come to the table so they could sign a contract.

2,John Deere Says It's About to Jump in the Satellite Business,"There’s plenty of names that probably come to mind when one thinks of satellite operators, but odds are a tractor company isn’t at the top of that list. John Deere wants to change that.Read more...",https://gizmodo.com/john-deere-tractor-satellites-geospatial-mapping-1849954535,Theres plenty of names that probably come to mind when one thinks of satellite operators but odds are a tractor company isnt at the top of that list. John Deere wants to change that. The 186yearold U. S. based agricultural giant first revealed its interest in exploring satellite tech late last year but now says its finalizing an agreement with an industry partner to make that interest a reality. In a recent interview with CNBC John Deere CEO Jahmy Hindman said that partnership could help the company achieve its goal of one day creating a geospatial map farmers can use to monitor and track their crops. We really have been focused on trying to solve connectivity globally Hindman told CNBC. We look at the burgeoning efforts that are happening in low Earth orbit satellites as an examplepotentiallyfor us to start to solve some those connectivity issues. Why satellites Some current John Deere models already rely on rudimentary satellite tech but the company imagines a near future where tractors both traditional and autonomous can communicate with orbiting satellites beaming them realtime information and communication. John Deere believes this flood of new data could help farmers increase productivity which in turn could yield increased food production. We believe SATCOM will unlock significant opportunities in agriculture by enabling farmers to take advantage of innovative technologies that rely on realtime information and communication Lane Arthur John Deeres VP of Data Applications and Analytics said in a statement. The agricultural companys interest in satellite tech could come at precisely the right time. A record number of satellites have entered Earths orbit in recent years a that trend thats only expected to continue. Space focused market intelligence firm Euroconsult estimates over 2500 additional satellites will launch each year until 2031. John Deere did not immediately respond to Gizmodos request for comment. Though they dont often dominate headlines John Deere and some of its agricultural competitors have spent years integrating sensors AI and other tech into their products. Last year for example John Deere revealed a fully autonomous GPSguided 8R farm tractor that could start shipping this year. Prior to that the company partnered with Volocopter to create a flying crop dusting drone. In 2023 highend tractors arguably look more like robots or computers than their early 20th century predecessors. John Deere says this embrace of evolving technologies could drive down costs for farmers and help them meet rising global demand for food which they estimate will increase by 50 globally in the next 10 years. Heightened valuations and investments awarded to firms billed as technology companies surely doesnt hurt either. Both of those rationals contributed to John Deere spending big in recent years to acquire numerous agricultural tech startups. This comes from our realization that technology is going to drive value creation and increase productivity profitability and sustainability for farmers Jorge Heraud John Deeres vice president of automation and autonomy said in an interview with CNBC. That focus on technology however means John Deere increasingly has to address issues once associated with tech firms like cybersecurity privacy regulations and right to repair disputes.

4,Sam Bankman-Fried is expected to plead not guilty in the FTX fraud case - and prosecutors won't be lenient,"""They're not going to be welcoming of any sweetheart plea deal,"" a former assistant US attorney told CNBC.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud-charges-bankruptcy-arraignment-plea-deal-2023-1,Sam BankmanFried is expected to enter a plea of not guilty in his fraud case on Tuesday. The disgraced FTX founder is accused of defrauding investors and is facing eight criminal charges. A former federal prosecutor weighs in on why BankmanFried wont just get a slap on the wrist. Sam BankmanFried is expected to plead not guilty on Tuesday initiating a legal backandforth that former federal prosecutors say is unlikely to result in a lenient deal from the Justice Department. When the FTX founder is arraigned in federal court for fraud charges he will appear in person to enter his not guilty plea the Wall Street Journal first reported on Friday. In confirming the news Bloomberg also pointed out that the move can provide his legal team more insight into prosecutors evidence and more time to potentially negotiate a lighter sentence if he changes his plea to guilty. BankmanFried is facing eight charges after his nowbankrupt cryptocurrency exchange reportedly lost at least 8 billion of customer money. US prosecutors have alleged he orchestrated a yearslong scheme where he used FTX deposits for various investments and daily expenses at his trading firm Alameda Research. The Justice Department is in a good position when it comes to the fraud case former federal prosecutor Danya Perry told CNBC noting that former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX cofounder Gary Wang have pleaded guilty. Behind the scenes she believes negotiations have been underway for a possible deal but prosecutors most likely have other cooperating witnesses lining up at the door. They have a mountain of paper evidence and in fact admissions by the defendant himself added Perry a former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York. So theyre not going to be in any particular rush and theyre not going to be welcoming of any sweetheart plea deal. Other former prosecutors have similarly cast doubt on BankmanFrieds ability to secure a deal. Ian McGinley who also previously served as an assistant US Attorney in the SDNY told CoinDesk that winning leniency typically requires a defendant to present evidence against someone else. But its unclear if BankmanFried can point the finger at others. The issue here that he faces is he is the head of FTX. The buck presumably stopped with him. So its hard to see how he could cooperate at all McGinley said. And if the case goes to trial he has almost no chance of getting acquitted former Watergate prosecutor Nick Akerman has said. BankmanFried hasnt helped his cause either especially while on a public apology tour after FTXs liquidity crisis in early November. Instead of laying low and listening to his legal counsel he spoke with an array of news outlets about the situation. I dont think Ill be arrested BankmanFried said during an interview hours before he was detained by Bahamian authorities on December 12. He even tweeted on Friday to deny moving tokens out of Alamedas crypto wallets shortly after being released on bail. A not guilty plea would mean the government continues its investigation but Perry told CNBC that prosecutors are only going to be digging in deeper. Theyve said theyre really looking under every stone here. She added That may not be his best move either.

Theres no amount of money they could give us to make us fly Southwest again Alex Kain told CNBC. A couple says they ended up driving for 18 hours on Christmas Eve to catch a lastminute flight after their Southwest flight from Denver was canceled amid the travel chaos. Alex Kain told CNBC that the flight he and his girlfriend were meant to take from Denver to Seattle was canceled at 2 a. m. They decided instead to hire a rental car and drive more than 1100 miles to an airport in Redmond Oregon which offers multiple flights a day to Seattle to catch an Alaska Airlines flight he said. Theres no amount of money they could give us to make us fly Southwest again Kain told the outlet. The lastminute change of plan ended up costing the couple up to 3000 Kain estimated. They told CNBC that they planned to request reimbursement to cover the hotels rental car gas and replacement flight. Some passengers were stranded over Christmas as the bitter winter storm that ripped through the US last week caused major disruptions to air travel across the country. Southwest took much longer to resume normal operations than other airlines. This has stemmed largely from issues with its scheduling tools including problems getting crew to where they needed to be to operate flights. The Dallasbased airline canceled 71 of its schedule or 2909 flights on Monday according to flighttracking site FlightAware. The airline also said it would operate roughly onethird of its regular schedule for the next several days. On Thursday Southwest cut 57 of its flights per FlightAware data compared with 5 at Frontier the US airline with the secondhighest percentage of flights canceled that day. But Southwest plans to resume normal operations with minimal disruptions from Friday. As of 6 a. m. ET only 39 flights less than 1 of its schedule are set to be cut according to FlightAware. We are encouraged by the progress weve made to realign crew their schedules and our fleet the airline said in a statement on Thursday. The carrier has asked corporate employees to volunteer for eighthour shifts helping with crew scheduling rather than carrying out their normal duties Insider reported. A union representing Southwest staff has blamed the airline for the chaos saying that outdated scheduling software meant flight attendants had to rely on manual solutions and phone calls to get accommodation and find out their next routes. We have much work ahead of us including investing in new solutions to manage widescale disruptions Southwest said Thursday. Southwest said passengers who experienced cancellations or significant delays between December 24 and January 2 can fill in a form to request a refund of their unused ticket. The airline says it will honor reasonable requests for reimbursement for meals hotel and alternate transportation. This includes rental cars or tickets on other airlines if passengers email their receipts. Southwest also said customers booked on flights through January 2 could rebook the same route on new dates within 30 days of their original departure date at no extra charge. Southwest did not immediately respond to Insiders request for comment made outside of normal working hours.

He is accused of impersonating the House speakers top aide in calls and emails to wealthy donors. A fundraiser for Rep. George Santos allegedly posed as House Speaker Kevin McCarthys chief of staff in a bid to fundraise money from wealthy donors according to CNBC. Sam Miele who worked for Santos campaign is said to have impersonated Dan Meyer who has served as McCarthys chief of staff since 2019 in phone calls to donors during the 2020 and 2022 election cycles people familiar with the matter said per CNBC. The Washington Times was the first to report the claim of impersonation last month when it said that the fundraiser allegedly posing as Meyer also used a fake email address to send followup emails to donors. A source a New York GOP operative who did not disclose their name told The Washington Times that McCarthys aides first became aware of the allegations after a GOP donor flagged contact from the supposed McCarthy aide as unusual in August 2021. According to CNBC Santos campaign paid Miele almost 50000 for fundraising during the embattled lawmakers failed 2020 run for Congress. Miele was also paid over 42000 during the 2022 cycle Federal Election Commission data shows per CNBC. Santos lawyer Joe Murray told CNBC that Miele was let go about a year ago.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering sampling wastewater taken from international aircraft to track any emerging new variants the agency told Reuters. Such a policy would offer a better solution to tracking the virus and slowing its entry into the United States than new travel restrictions announced this week by the U. S. and other countries three infectious disease experts told Reuters. Travel restrictions have so far failed to significantly curb the spread of Covid and function largely as optics said Dr. Michael Osterholm an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota. As Covid19 infections surge in China the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering sampling wastewater taken from international aircraft to track any emerging new variants the agency told Reuters. Such a policy would offer a better solution to tracking the virus and slowing its entry into the United States than new travel restrictions announced this week by the U. S. and other countries which require mandatory negative Covid tests for travelers from China three infectious disease experts told Reuters. Travel restrictions such as mandatory testing have so far failed to significantly curb the spread of Covid and function largely as optics said Dr. Michael Osterholm an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota. They seem to be essential from a political standpoint. I think each government feels like they will be accused of not doing enough to protect their citizens if they dont do these he said. The United States this week also expanded its voluntary genomic sequencing program at airports adding Seattle and Los Angeles to the program. That brings the total number of airports gathering information from positive tests to seven. But experts said that may not provide a meaningful sample size. A better solution would be testing wastewater from airlines which would offer a clearer picture of how the virus is mutating given Chinas lack of data transparency said Dr Eric Topol a genomics expert and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla California. Getting wastewater off planes from China would be a very good tactic Topol said adding that its important that the United States upgrade its surveillance tactics because of China being so unwilling to share its genomic data. China has said criticism of its Covid statistics is groundless and downplayed the risk of new variants saying it expects mutations to be more infectious but less severe. Still doubts over official Chinese data have prompted many places including the United States Italy and Japan to impose new testing rules on Chinese visitors as Beijing lifted travel controls. Airplane wastewater analysis is among several options the CDC is considering to help slow the introduction of new variants into the United States from other countries CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said in an email. The agency is grappling with a lack of transparency about Covid in China after the country of 1. 4 billion people abruptly lifted strict Covid lockdowns and testing policies unleashing the virus into an undervaccinated and previously unexposed population. Previous Covid19 wastewater surveillance has shown to be a valuable tool and airplane wastewater surveillance could potentially be an option she wrote. French researchers reported in July that airplane wastewater tests showed requiring negative Covid tests before international flights does not protect countries from the spread of new variants. They found the omicron variant in wastewater from two commercial airplanes that flew from Ethiopia to France in December 2021 even though passengers had been required to take Covid tests before boarding. California researchers reported in July that sampling of community wastewater in San Diego detected the presence of the alpha delta epsilon and omicron variants up to 14 days before they started showing up on nasal swabs. Osterholm and others said mandatory testing before travel to the United States is unlikely to keep new variants out of the country. Border closures or border testing really makes very little difference. Maybe it slows it down by a few days he said because the virus is likely to spread worldwide and could infect people in Europe or elsewhere who may then bring it to the United States. David Dowdy an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said increasing genomic surveillance is important and wastewater sampling could be helpful but the testing takes time. I think we should be cautious in how much we expect those data will be able to truly inform our ability to respond he said.,2022-12-30T03:35:00Z,George Santos campaign paid staffer nearly $100k to pretend to be Kevin McCarthy's chief of staff and get money from donors,Extremely Negative,730,"pretend, fake, allegations, embattled, violation, allegation, complaints, complaints, complaint, complaint, controversial, falls","criminal, criminal, criminal, fire, Republican, Communist","George, Santos, Kevin, McCarthys, George, Santos, Kevin, McCarthys, George, Santos, Kevin, McCarthys, Sam, Miele, Santos, Dan, Meyer, Meyer, lawsuit, McCarthy, Santos, Miele, Miele, Joe, Murray, Miele, Santos, Brendan, Fischer, Robert, Maguire, Fischer, lawsuit, Santos, Santos, lawsuit, Santos, Santos, lawsuit, Jack, Ma",    entrepreneur
11,'Quiet Hiring' Is on the Horizon – Here's What Employers and Employees Need to Know,"This new hiring trend could be the difference between a business sinking or swimming in 2023, but it all depends on how employers communicate the change to their employees.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/what-is-quiet-hiring-and-how-you-can-use-it-to-your/442210,Quiet Hiring Is on the Horizon Heres What Employers and Employees Need to Know This new hiring trend could be the difference between a business sinking or swimming in 2023 but it all depends on how employers communicate the change to their employees. 2022 came with a slew of new workplace lingo quiet quitting quiet firing and fast quitting. However a new trend is likely to dominate the hiring space in 2023 quiet hiring. The concept of quiet hiring hinges on the idea that a business can add new skills and fill gaps without actually hiring fulltime employees. Gartner research expert Emily Rose McRae told CNBC that quiet hiring often comes in two different forms internal and external. Internal quiet hiring means current employees might temporarily move to other roles or take on different assignments within the organization. External quiet hiring means hiring shortterm contractors to keep the business running without taking on more fulltime employees. The reality for the next year is whether or not we go into a recession everyones a little nervous McRae said per CNBC. In a lot of cases organizations are not necessarily doing a hiring freeze or layoffs but maybe slowing down a little bit on their hiring. Although quiet hiring might be the ideal solution for employers to ensure workplace efficiency without causing financial strain its success or failure could hinge on one factor communication. Related Googles Quiet Hiring Method Is Excellent for Employers But Dangerous for Employees Who Quiet Quit McRae warns that without adequate transparency about the reasoning behind the decision to implement quiet hiring some employees might take the shift from their current role into another one as a signal they arent needed and therefore begin looking for other opportunities. McRae told CNBC that employers should be clear about what the move means for workers and assure them of the importance. If youre asking a bunch of people to make this move you should be able to articulate What does this mean for them McRae told the outlet. Employers should reiterate how the move not only helps the organization but also the individuals strengths and career trajectory. McRae encourages employees to think about leveraging quiet hiring as a way to advance their careers and current positions.

The round will likely led by Andreessen Horowitz also known as a16z per an email reviewed by CNBC as the famed venture capital firm reached out to prospective investors. Prior backers for SpaceX include Founders Fund Gigafund Sequoia and others. Over the last 12 months SpaceX raised more than 2 billion including a 250 million funding round in July when it was valued at 127 billion. Bloomberg had reported in December that SpaceX was allowing shareholders to sell equity at 77 per share which valued the company at about a 140 billion. Notably a16z was also a participant in Elon Musks 44 billion Twitter acquisition a deal that some Tesla investors have since lamented. Despite some snags in 2022 SpaceX still notched milestones such as its satellite internet provider Starlink surpassing 1 million subscribers. Musk also facilitated Starlink as an emergency internet provider for Ukraine citizens and soldiers amid the ongoing war with Russia. SpaceX too also had more than 60 reuseable rocket launches last year via its Falcon program.

Bob Iger the chief executive said hybrid workers will be asked to treat Monday through Thursday as inperson workdays according to an email seen by CNBC which first reported the news. As Ive been meeting with teams throughout the company over the past few months Ive been reminded of the tremendous value in being together with the people you work with Iger wrote. As youve heard me say many times creativity is the heart and soul of who we are and what we do at Disney. And in a creative business like ours nothing can replace the ability to connect observe and create with peers that comes from being physically together nor the opportunity to grow professionally by learning from leaders and mentors. The move comes after Iger who ran Disney as CEO for 15 years and retired as chairman in 2021 came out of retirement to serve as chief executive for two years. He took the helm from Bob Chapel in November in a surprise comeback to boost investor confidence and profits at Disneys streaming media division. During the Covid19 pandemic workers were forced to work from home and many now split their time between there and the office in a hybrid model. Disney is one of a number of companies clamping down on flexible working. The US businesses Snap Tesla and Goldman Sachs have asked their staff to come back to the office while many other companies have stuck to hybrid working. Apple in September told staff to return to the office three days a week while the Twitter owner Elon Musk ordered nearly all employees to come back five days a week in November. Citi and HSBC are among banks that have promised to make hybrid working permanent but dealmakers still face pressure to be in the office. Most managers believe flexible working helps productivity though long hours are still seen as essential for career progress a UK study has shown.,2023-01-10T08:11:41Z,"Elon Musk's SpaceX is launching a $750 million funding round with Andreessen Horowitz that values the company at $137 billion, report says",Extremely Negative,210,"snags, emergency",-,"Elon, Musks, Elon, Musks, Andreessen, Horowitz, Elon, Musks, Musk",-

He served as one of Guggenheims first managing partners and was a touted market commentator. Minerd was regarded as one of markets bond kings due to his highly regarded analysis. Guggenheim Partners chief investment officer Scott Minerd died unexpectedly on Wednesday at 63 the investment firm said. He died after a heart attack during his regular workout and is survived by husband Eloy Mendez according to Guggenheim. I have known Scott for over 30 years and we were partners much of that time. Scott was a key innovator and thought leader who was instrumental in building Guggenheim Investments into the global business it is today said Mark Walter chief executive and one of the founding partners of Guggenheim said in a statement. He will be greatly missed by all. Guggenheim Investments will continue to be led by CoPresidents Dina DiLorenzo and David Rone as well as Anne Walsh a managing partner and CIO of Guggenheim Partners Investment Management. Minerd who was regarded as one of markets bond kings due to his highly regarded analysis joined the firm as one of its first managing partners shortly after its inception. He was a frequent markets commentator on both social media and television for outlets such as the Financial Times Bloomberg CNBC and the Wall Street Journal. CNBC anchor Brian Sullivan took to Twitter to mourn Minerds death saying he was a giant of a man with an even bigger heart. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman also posted on Twitter to mourn Minerd saying that he was an old fashioned handshake businessman whose word was his bond. Before his 25year tenure with Guggenheim Minerd worked with Morgan Stanley as a risk manager then moved to Credit Suisse First Boston as a managing director. Minerd was also a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets. He attended the Wharton Business School in Pennsylvania.

Walgreens might have blown the horn too loud over retail theft a company executive said in an earnings call on Thursday. We might have cried too hard on theft said James Kehoe CFO of Walgreens Boots Alliance per CNBC. In its 2022 Retail Security Survey the National Retail Federation reported that 32. 8 of its surveyed retailers said organized retail crime has become much more of a concern in the past five years. The Walgreens executive also said it has hired private security companies to manage the theft. The security companies are proven to be largely ineffective Kehoe noted. In its November earnings call for the third quarter Target said it had lost 400 million in 2022 due to a significant increase in theft and organized retail crime across our business. Walmart also raised the alarm over the issue last month. Related Walmart CEO Doug McMillon Says Organized Retail Theft Could Lead to Stores Closing The thefts are also going viral on social media such as when two men made off with about 35000 in merchandise from an Apple store in Palo Alto California in November. In October 2021 Walgreens closed five stores in San Francisco over what it said was widespread shoplifting per Bloomberg. Companies often use shrinkage the gap between what stores think their inventories are versus what they have in stock and it includes things like employees stealing or breaking products and theft from external stakeholders per CNBC. Last year Kehoe said shrinkage was clocking in at about 3. 5 of inventory. This year compared to 2021 shrinkage has come down in the lower 2s call it the mid 2. 5 2. 6 kind of range now he said. And were stabilized he added. The company also said it probably invested too much in security guards. Actually probably we put in too much and we might step back a little bit from that he said. Walgreens reported betterthanexpected earnings sending its stock up slightly.

18,Weed has been legal in New York state since 2021 but the first dispensary is set to open — finally — in Manhattan,"""These shops are masquerading as safe, legal entities, but there are currently no licensed sales happening right now in the state of New York,"" a rep for the New York State Office of Cannabis Management said.",https://www.businessinsider.com/where-is-the-first-legal-weed-dispensary-opening-in-nyc-2022-12,Weed has been legal in New York state since 2021 but the first dispensary is set to open finally in Manhattan Marijuana has been legal in New York State since March 2021 but there are still no licensed dispensaries in NYC. The first legal dispensary in New York State will be opened by an HIVAIDS nonprofit in Manhattan on Dec. 29 Gov. Hochul announced. Cannabis tourism has become a billiondollar industry but up until this week visitors to New York City couldnt find licensed dispensaries to buy weed despite the drugs legal status. According to the governors official site on Thursday Housing Works a New York Citybased HIVAIDS nonprofit will become the first nonprofit in the state to legally sell cannabis products when it opens the doors to its new store in the East Village of Manhattan. In March 2021 cannabis was legalized for recreational use in New York state. Last August Gov. Kathy Hochul said her goal was to open 20 legal dispensaries by the end of 2022 digital news platform The City reported. All sale proceeds at Housing Works will go toward the organizations efforts to provide job opportunities legal advocacy and comprehensive housing and health services the governors site reads. The industry will continue to grow from here creating inclusive opportunity in every corner of New York State with revenues directed to our schools and revitalizing communities Hochul said in statement. Prior to this announcement how and where to legally obtain weed in New York City was a confusing matter. There had been no way to legally purchase recreational marijuana in New York City although using the drug is permitted by law for those ages 21 and older. The first 36 retail licenses were issued in November to 28 businesses and eight nonprofits out of 900 applicants statewide NBC New York reported. However cannabis has been available through illicit businesses already threatening the success of future legal dispensaries according to CNBC. Weed found in bodegas brickandmortar stores and popups can easily be purchased but the products are unregulated and often untested for contaminants. A November survey by the New York Medical Cannabis Industry Association found that THC products purchased from 20 illicit marijuana businesses in New York City tested positive for E. coli salmonella pesticides and heavy metals. These shops are masquerading as safe legal entities Trivette Knowles a press officer at the New York State Office of Cannabis Management told CNBC. But there are currently no licensed sales happening right now in the state of New York. According to CNBC city officials are cracking down on the reported tens of thousands of illegal businesses in New York City as licensed retailers prepare to open their doors. Data experts estimate the national market for illicit businesses is worth around 60 billion while the legal industry is half that the report reads. We will not let the economic opportunities that legal cannabis offers be taken for a ride by unlicensed establishments New York Mayor Eric Adams said in a news conference. Harlem in upper Manhattan is expected to be home to the first forprofit retail location in New York state after the lease was inked with just three weeks left in the year according to The Citys report. Its unclear when the dispensary will open or which business will operate the location.

Just over 3000 employees will be let go one of the sources said but the final number is yet to be determined. That scale of layoffs would be the largest since the 2008 financial crisis one of the sources said. The sources could not be named as the information was not yet disclosed publicly. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Bloomberg News reported on Sunday that Goldman would eliminate about 3200 positions. Goldman had 49100 employees at the end of the third quarter after adding significant numbers of staff during the coronavirus pandemic. The layoffs are likely to affect most of the banks major divisions but should centre on Goldman Sachs investment banking arm one of the sources said. Wall Street banks have suffered a major slowdown in corporate dealmaking activity as a result of volatile global financial markets. Hundreds of jobs are also likely to be reduced from Goldman Sachs consumer business Marcus after it scaled back plans for the lossmaking unit the sources said. The banks chief executive David Solomon sent a yearend voice memo to staff warning of a head count reduction in the first half of January two separate sources said. Goldman Sachs declined comment on the memo. The job cuts come ahead of the banks annual bonus payments which are usually delivered later in January and are expected to fall about 40 per cent. The bank restarted its annual performance review process and staff cuts in September after pausing for two years during the pandemic. The Wall Street giant typically trims about 1 per cent to 5 per cent of employees each year. These new cuts will come on top of the earlier layoffs. Global banks including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. have reduced their work forces in recent months as a dealmaking boom on Wall Street fizzled out owing to high interest rates tensions between the United States and China the war between Russia and Ukraine and soaring inflation. Global investment banking fees nearly halved in 2022 with US77billion earned by the banks down from US132. 3billion one year earlier Dealogic data showed. The total value of mergers and acquisitions MA globally had slumped 37 per cent to US3. 66trillion by Dec. 20 according to Dealogic data after hitting an alltime high of US5. 9trillion last year. Banks had executed US517billion worth of equity capital markets ECM transactions by late December 2022 the lowest level since the early 2000s and a 66percent drop from 2021s bonanza according to Dealogic data. Despite the slowdown Goldmans top deal makers told Reuters in recent interviews that they are bullish on an MA recovery in the second half of 2023.,2023-01-09T13:47:57Z,Weed has been legal in New York state since 2021 but the first dispensary is set to open — finally — in Manhattan,Generally Neutral,680,"confusing, illicit, threatening, untested, illicit, illicit, unlicensed, unclear, falls","Marijuana, marijuana, drug, marijuana, illegal, Communist","lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit, Hochul, lawsuit, Kathy, Hochul, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit, Trivette, Knowles, lawsuit, lawsuit, Eric, Adams, Jack, Ma",businessinsider

The airline is currently offering affected passengers 25000 frequent flier points valued at over 300. As Southwest Airlines continues to address its costly holiday travel meltdown qualifying passengers are being offered 25000 frequent flier points in addition to refunds reimbursements and vouchers. Passengers whose flights were disrupted between Dec. 24 and Jan. 2 received an email on Tuesday from Southwest CEO Bob Jordan apologizing for the airlines widespread flight cancellations and offering 25000 Rapid Rewards points valued at over 300 the Wall Street Journal reported. On behalf of Southwest I want to let you know were so sorry Jordan wrote in the letter. I know that no amount of apologies can undo your experience. It will cost Southwest more than frequent flier points to correct the mistakes made during December 2022 which left thousands stranded at airports over the holidays thanks to winter storms and the airlines outdated scheduling technology that thwarted staffing. The company could end up paying between 600 million and 700 million Bank of America airline stock analyst Andrew Didora told CNBC. The estimate includes both lost revenue from refunds and reimbursements for expenses like hotels and rental cars CNBC reported. According to Jordans email the points are being offered as a gesture of goodwill and are also available to passengers who requested a refund or travel reimbursement. The Points Guy reporter Zach Griff tweeted on Tuesday that he was among those who received the email noting that the points will come in addition to nearly 500 he already received in compensation in the form of refunds reimbursements and vouchers. Although its unclear exactly how many travelers experienced significant delays or cancellations during the meltdown those hoping to claim points were put on a virtual waitlist on Tuesday due to a high volume of traffic according to Griff. Zach Griff ZachGriff January 3 2023 While Griff reported a 15minute wait to receive points another traveler told WSJ he had an estimated wait time of over an hour to redeem the 75000 points offered to his party of three.

Crypto winter inflation and a possible recession havent dampened wealthy car buyers enthusiasm for the RollsRoyce. On the contrary the highend automaker clocked record sales in 2022 making it clear plenty of people are still ready to shell out a halfmillion dollars for a name synonymous with luxury. CNBC reports that the BMWowned company delivered 6021 cars last year up 8 over 2021 and the first time the company crossed the 6000 mark. The same article quotes Rolls CEO Torsten MullerOtvos who said his company hasnt seen any slowdown or downturn. We havent seen any negative impact. While CNBCs article notes that RollsRoyce opened an invitationonly private office in Dubai to cater to its VIP customers it reports that the United States was the biggest marketplace for Rolls buyers in 2022. Thirtyfive percent of the companys sales of its 500000plus vehicles came from American buyers with China coming in second for sales at 25. Heres more about the companys banner year The companys SUV the Cullinan was its bestseller in 2022 making up about half of global sales MullerOtvos said. Its Ghost model accounted for over 30 of sales while the Phantom accounted for about 10. Meanwhile the automakers biggest launch of 2022 was the Spectre RollsRoyces first electric vehicle and the beginning of its plan to become fully electric by 2030. According to CNBC 300 US customers had already preordered the 413000 Spectre before RollsRoyce revealed the EV version of the rebooted model. While MullerOtvos indicated orders kept climbing he did not provide actual numbers. The CEO also said that should there be a fullblown recession RollsRoyce is insulated against an economic downturn thanks to a hefty backlog of orders it will fulfill throughout the year.

O is nearing a preliminary deal to build production facilities in Indonesia with a capacity of one million units Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted on Wednesday Please be cautious about writing articles citing unnamed sources as they are frequently false in a comment on a tweet referencing the report. Indonesias senior cabinet minister Luhut Pandjaitan who has been leading the talks with Tesla said negotiations were still ongoing but declined to say more citing a nondisclosure agreement. The electricvehicle maker did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Musk last month said Tesla was close to picking the location of its new Gigafactory following media reports that the automaker could announce a new factory in the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon as soon as December. In November Musk said South Korea was among its top candidate locations for a factory it plans to build in Asia for making EVs according to South Koreas presidential office. Tesla makes its electric cars in Chinas Shanghai Germanys Berlin and Austin and Fremont in the United States.

23,Sam Bankman-Fried borrowed $546M from his hedge fund to buy a Robinhood stake,"When Sam Bankman-Fried bought a nearly 7.6% stake in Robinhood, the popular stock-trading app, earlier this year, he financed the deal with more than half a billion dollars borrowed from the his own hedge fund — the entity that prosecutors say was illegally f…",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/business/robinhood-sam-bankman-fried-alameda/index.html,When Sam BankmanFried bought a nearly 7. 6 stake in Robinhood the popular stocktrading app earlier this year he financed the deal with more than half a billion dollars borrowed from his own hedge fund the entity that prosecutors say was illegally funneling customer funds from its affiliated platform FTX. In an affidavit that emerged Tuesday BankmanFried said he and FTX cofounder Gary Wang borrowed more than 546 million from the hedge fund Alameda Research which they used to purchase the Robinhood shares via a holding company primarily controlled by BankmanFried. Wang has since pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud and conspiracy in cooperation with US prosecutors investigating FTXs collapse. BankmanFried has been indicted on eight criminal counts. Since stepping down from FTX he has repeatedly denied knowingly committing fraud his arraignment date hasnt been set. He was arrested earlier this month in the Bahamas where FTX was based and extradited to the US last week. He is under house arrest at his parents home in California and scheduled to enter a plea in a federal court in Manhattan on January 3. He could face life in prison if found guilty. BankmanFrieds stake in Robinhood is now at the center of a separate multinational legal battle over the assets associated with FTXs bankrupt crypto empire. Four separate entities have laid claim to the approximately 56 million shares worth about 450 million. FTXs new management which is trying to claw back funds for investors and customers of the bankrupt platform want to wrest control of the shares from the Antiguabased holding company 90 owned by BankmanFried. BankmanFried himself claims ownership of the shares seeking a source of payment for legal expenses according to FTX. Also claiming the Robinhood shares are bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi and an individual FTX creditor. Because the competing claims FTX filed a motion earlier this month to the Delaware bankruptcy court to keep the assets frozen until the court can resolve the issues in a manner that is fair to all creditors of the Debtors. Its not clear from the court filings whether the 546 million used to purchase the stake included funds that prosecutors allege were stolen from customer deposits in FTX. BlockFi a prominent crypto lender halted withdrawals as FTX came unraveled citing significant exposure to the trading platform. It filed for bankruptcy on November 28 just over two weeks after FTX Alameda and dozens of affiliates went under. BlockFi is suing BankmanFried for the Robinhood shares which BlockFi claims it is owed after Alameda defaulted on 680 million in collateralized loan obligations. Earlier this month Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC that hes not surprised the stake is one of the more valuable assets on FTXs books because it is a public companys stock. We dont have a lot of information that you guys dont have. Were just watching this unfold and its going to be locked up in bankruptcy proceedings most likely for some time. Meanwhile the recent implosion of cryptocurrencies has been disastrous for Robinhood. The company laid off 23 of its staff in August after cutting 9 of its employees in April.

24,"'Maybe we cried too much' over shoplifting, Walgreens executive says","Throughout the pandemic, major retailers have warned about surging theft and a rise in brazen shoplifting attempts. But a top Walgreens executive now says the freakout may have been overblown.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/06/business/walgreens-shoplifting-retail/index.html,Throughout the pandemic major retailers have warned about surging theft and a rise in brazen shoplifting attempts. But a top Walgreens executive now says the freakout may have been overblown. Maybe we cried too much last year about merchandise losses Walgreens finance chief James Kehoe acknowledged Thursday on an earnings call. The companys rate of shrink merchandise losses due to theft fraud damages misscanned items and other errors fell from 3. 5 of total sales last year to around 2. 5 during its latest quarter. Kehoes message is a notable shift from comments about theft from Walgreens and other retailers like Walmart and Target over the last nearly three years. Companies and retail industry groups have tried to draw attention to shoplifting and organized retail crime rings smashing windows and grabbing aisles full of merchandise off shelves urging lawmakers to crack down. Incidents have certainly happened Many political leaders and local and national news outlets including CNN have picked up on viral incidents of smashandgrab robberies. So retailers took action. Some began locking up more products like deodorant and toothpaste adding extra security guards and even shuttering stores. Last January Walgreens WBA said its shrink was up by more 50 from the year prior. The company blamed part of that spike on organized retail crime and closed five locations in the San Francisco area in 2021 claiming theft as the reason for their closure. This is not petty theft Kehoe said last January. These are gangs that actually go in and empty our stores of beauty products. And its a real issue. But a year later Kehoe said Thursday that the company added too much extra security in stores. Probably we put in too much and we might step back a little bit from that he said of security staffing. The company has found private security guards to be largely ineffective in deterring theft so instead its putting in more police and law enforcement officers. The numbers used didnt add up Though Walgreens may have overblown the shoplifting threat over the last few years its true that theft has always been a problem for retailers and that it often spikes during recessions and other periods of economic hardship when people are desperate and may feel the need to turn to petty crime to sustain themselves. Whats more recent factors like shortstaffed stores and selfcheckout can make it easier for thieves to steal. The National Retail Federation estimated that shrink cost retailers 94. 5 billion in 2021 up from 61. 7 billion in 2019 before the pandemic. Shoplifting often does not go reported to the police but companies have said theft has worsened during the Covid crisis. Along with other retailers weve seen a significant increase in theft and organized retail crime across our business Target TGT CEO Brian Cornell said in November. Walmart WMT CEO Doug McMillon said last month on CNBC that theft is an issue and higher than what it has historically been. He warned stores could close if it continued. However its not clear the numbers add up. For example data released by the San Francisco Police Department does not support the explanation Walgreens gave that it was closing five stores because of organized retail theft the San Francisco Chronicle reported in 2021. One of the shuttered stores that closed had only seven reported shoplifting incidents in 2021 and a total of 23 since 2018 according to the newspaper. Overall the five stores that closed had fewer than two recorded shoplifting incidents a month on average since 2018. Similarly a 2021 Los Angeles Times analysis of figures released by industry groups on losses due to organized retail crime found there is reason to doubt the problem is anywhere near as large or widespread as they say.,2023-01-06T17:37:56Z,"

The standard screening test for potential psychopaths is the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. Many of the traits we seek in leaders such as fearlessness dominant behavior and immunity to stress are found in psychopaths. Indeed psychopaths are found in greater proportions among CEOs. Between 3 and 21 of CEOs are probably psychopaths according to a 2016 study by Bond University psychologist Nathan Brooks. In 2021 Fortune found that 12 of corporate senior leaders in the United States showed psychopathic traits. In fact most people display some symptoms of psychopathy superficiality glibness promiscuity etc. and that does not make you a psychopath. According to CNBC while one out of five business leaders may show psychopathic tendencies a certain degree of nonconformity and unconventionally can help drive innovation. The standard screening test for potential psychopaths is the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. In the test a clinician interviews a potential sociopath and scores them on 20 criteria such as promiscuous sexual Behavior or impulsivity. On each criterion the subject is ranked on a 3point scale 0 item does not appl y 1 item applie s somewhat 2 item definitely applies. The scores are summed to create a rank of zero to 40. Anyone who scores 30 and above is probably a psycho.

Exxon is projected to rake in more than 56 billion while Chevron may reach 37 billion per the Financial Times citing data from SP Capital IQ. For both the companies annual earnings are seen hitting record highs. The profit boon comes after global oil prices soared in response to Russias invasion of Ukraine which squeezed supply in energy markets. While Brent crude was trading around 86 a barrel at last check Tuesday the European benchmark surged toward 140 last March.

32,3 reasons why Nike's ex-CEO is what Disney needs right now,Mark Parker is credited with overseeing a smooth CEO transition at Nike and engineering the company's successful direct-to-consumer push.,https://www.businessinsider.com/nike-ex-ceo-mark-parker-what-disney-needs-on-board-2023-1,3 reasons why Nikes exCEO is what Disney needs right now Parker remains executive chairman of Nike where hes credited with a smooth CEO transition. At Nike Parker engineered the companys directtoconsumer push. The Walt Disney Co. on Wednesday said former Nike CEO Mark Parker will become the companys next chairman as it opposes activist investor Nelson Peltzs attempt to join the Disney board. The moves set up a boardroom struggle that will play out over the next several months. While Disney hasnt announced a date for this years annual meeting which will mark the start of Parkers new role last years meeting took place on March 9. Heres why Parker a Nike lifer could help Disney work through its problems and why some watchers question the decision to tap him for the most important chair in the boardroom. Hes credited with a smooth CEO transition at Nike After the short rocky tenure of Bob Chapek as Disney CEO the company needs steady hands as it searches for its next longterm CEO in the wake of Bob Igers temporary return. Parker has been a stable force at Nike and Disney. He joined Nike in 1979. He became CEO in 2006 and served in the role until 2020. He remains executive chairman of Nike and joined Disneys board in 2016. At Nike Parker handed the CEO baton to John Donahoe in January 2020. Peltz isnt the only investor who wants Disney to prioritize finding a longterm CEO to succeed Iger. Disneys board believes Parker can do that. During his four decades at Nike Mark has led one of the worlds most recognized consumer brands through various market evolutions and a successful CEO transition and he is uniquely positioned to chair the Disney board during this period of transformation said outgoing Disney Chair Susan Arnold in a press release. Parkers also chairing a new board committee searching for Disneys next CEO. But some question Parkers credentials as a succession expert including Reuters columnist Jennifer Saba who noted he was on Disneys board when it tapped Chapek for the job. Relatedly Donahoes tenure at Nike isnt without critics including those who worry about a talent drain on his watch. Not to mention Saba points out chairing a large public company is a fulltime job. Parkers now chairing two of them. Peltz echoed those concerns Thursday in a CNBC interview. While he credited Parker for the wonderful job he did at Nike he also criticized Disneys 71 billion acquisition of Fox which happened during Parkers service on Disneys board. Parker is a directtoconsumer expert In a letter to shareholders filed with the SEC Peltz Trian Group argued Disney has a flawed directtoconsumer strategy despite having a significant IP advantage. In the CNBC interview Peltz called Disney the most advantaged consumer company on the planet. In 2017 as Nike CEO Parker introduced the Consumer Direct Offense an aggressive directsales push thats been a winner with Wall Street although frustrating some on Main Street. Since that time Nikes direct sales more than doubled to 18. 7 billion according to the companys last annual report. Nikes stock is up 117 since it announced the strategy in 2017 while the SP 500 is up 65. Always on the offense In its letter to Disney shareholders Trian said it has a singular focus on improving shareholder returns. While he was Nike CEO Parker frequently used the phrase always on the offense to describe the companys aggressive approach to growing sales and market share. The companys stock climbed more than 760 during his CEO tenure far exceeding the market. Revenue nearly tripled to 39. 1 billion. But the financial success at Nike also came with links to scandals including bruising criticisms about a toxic workplace and a boys club culture and a connection to disgraced running coach Alberto Salazar.

After years of avoiding the political backlash that has been directed at big tech peers such as Amazon and Google the software giant now appears to be on a collision course with U. S. regulators emboldened by President Joe Bidens push to get tough on anticompetitive behavior. The FTC claims the merger could violate antitrust laws by suppressing competitors to Microsofts Xbox game console and its growing Xbox Game Pass subscription business. At the center of the dispute is Microsofts rivalry with PlayStationmaker Sony to secure popular Activision Blizzard franchises like the military shooter game Call of Duty. Microsofts response to the FTC tries to downplay Xboxs role in the industry describing itself as the thirdplace manufacturer of gaming consoles behind Sony and Nintendo and one of just many publishers of popular video games with next to no presence in mobile gaming where it is trying to make gains. Activision Blizzard filed its own rebuttal to the FTC complaint on Thursday criticizing what it described as the FTCs unfounded assumption that Microsoft would want to withhold Call of Duty from platforms that compete with Xbox. Its CEO Bobby Kotick said he believes the companies will prevail. The dispute could be a difficult test case for Bidenappointed FTC Chair Lina Khan who has sought to strengthen enforcement of antitrust rules. The FTC voted 31 earlier in December to issue the complaint seeking to block the deal with Khan and the two other Democratic commissioners voting in favor and the sole Republican voting against. The deal is also under close scrutiny in the European Union and the United Kingdom where investigations arent due to be completed until next year. The FTCs complaint points to Microsofts 2021 acquisition of wellknown game developer Bethesda Softworks and its parent company ZeniMax as an example of where Microsoft is making some upcoming game titles exclusive to Xbox despite assuring European regulators it had no intention to do so. Microsoft on Thursday objected to the FTCs characterization saying it made clear to European regulators it would approach exclusivity for future game titles on a casebycase basis which is exactly what it has done. The FTCs suit describes topselling franchises like Call of Duty as important because they develop a base of loyal users attached to their preferred console or streaming service. With control of Activisions content Microsoft would have the ability and increased incentive to withhold or degrade Activisions content in ways that substantially lessen competition including competition on product quality price and innovation the FTC lawsuit says. This loss of competition would likely result in significant harm to consumers in multiple markets at a pivotal time for the industry. Microsoft signaled that it will vigorously fight the case in court with a team led by highprofile corporate attorney Beth Wilkinson while also leaving open the possibility of a settlement. Even with confidence in our case we remain committed to creative solutions with regulators that will protect competition consumers and workers in the tech sector said Microsofts president Brad Smith in a statement Thursday. As weve learned from our lawsuits in the past the door never closes on the opportunity to find an agreement that can benefit everyone. Microsofts last big antitrust battle occurred more than two decades ago when a federal judge ordered its breakup following the companys anticompetitive actions related to its dominant Windows software. That verdict was overturned on appeal although the court imposed other penalties on the company. The FTCs decision to send the complaint to its inhouse Administrative Law Judge D. Michael Chappell instead of seeking an urgent federal court injunction to halt the merger could drag the case out at least until August when the first evidence hearing is scheduled. Microsofts agreement with Activision Blizzard requires it to pay the video game company a breakup fee of up to 3 billion if it cant close the deal before July 18. The timing and trajectory of the case could change depending on how regulators in the U. K. and Europe rule on the merger next year. If Microsoft wins approval in Europe it could use that to try to expedite the process in U. S. courts. The merger faced yet another challenge this week from a group of individual video game players who sued in a San Francisco federal court to stop the deal on antitrust grounds. The plaintiffs all fans of Activision Blizzards Call of Duty franchise and other popular titles such as World of Warcraft Overwatch and Diablo are particularly concerned about how the consolidation would affect future game quality innovation and output said their attorney Joseph Alioto. When theres a lack of competition the quality necessarily goes down Alioto said. By eliminating Activision it gives such a strong position to Microsoft that they can do whatever they want.

On Tuesday Wells Fargo shared major changes happening to its business in 2023. The company announced strategic plans to focus on serving bank customers and minority homebuyers. It also intends to descale its mortgage business formerly one of the top lenders in the country. Additionally the company will exit the correspondent business which purchases loans from thirdparty lenders and reduce the size of its mortgageservicing portfolio. We are making the decision to continue to reduce risk in the mortgage business by reducing its size and narrowing its focus Kleber Santos CEO of consumer lending said in the press release. Executives have acknowledged that the changes will result in a new round of layoffs CNBC reported but declined to estimate the number of employees who will be affected. Related Youre More Likely to Get Laid Off If You Work in One of These Industries Study Finds With the new focus and direction Wells Fargos business model will more closely resemble that of rival banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America both of which stepped back from the mortgage business after the Great Recession of 2008. The deescalation of Wells Fargo as a major lender might have implications for the mortgage market in the U. S. When major lenders exit the business nonbanks step in to meet demand. However these nonplayers are far less regulated than banks CNBC reported. Related Choosing the Best Mortgage Lender for You Currently Wells Fargo is the thirdlargest mortgage lender behind Rocket Mortgage and United Wholesale Mortgage both of which are nonbank players. One of the biggest initiatives in Wells Fargos new focus is supporting minority homebuyers. The bank will invest 100 million in advancing racial equity in homeownership and stated it intends to continue to invest in this sector for years to come. As the largest bank lender to Black and Hispanic families for the last decade we remain deeply committed to advancing racial equity in homeownership Santos said in the release. Additionally Kristy Fercho head of home lending and head of diverse segments representation and inclusion at Wells Fargo stated that the company will hire additional mortgage consultants in communities of color. The initiative comes months after the bank was exposed for falsifying diversity efforts. A former employee claimed Wells Fargo had a practice of holding interviews for positions that were either already filled or didnt exist. The interviews were a vehicle for recording diversity efforts on paper rather than carrying them out in reality. Joe Bruno the former Wells Fargo employee who came forward with the claims had been fired by the bank in August 2021.

35,FTX Co-Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Pleads Not Guilty to Fraud Charges - CNET,The former crypto exchange CEO faces eight counts of money laundering and conspiracy to commit fraud.,https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-fraud-charges/,The cofounder and former CEO of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX Sam BankmanFried has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges according to CNBC. BankmanFried appeared in a federal courtroom on Tuesday in New York City for his arraignment where he faced eight fraud and conspiracy charges. The presiding judge has not set a trial date. Two of BankmanFrieds associates already pleaded guilty to fraud charges and are said to be cooperating with investigators. BankmanFried was extradited from the Bahamas in December as US authorities continue investigating FTXs titanic collapse. Prosecutors say BankmanFried took peoples money stored with the cryptocurrency exchange and fraudulently sent it to and from Alameda Research his cryptocurrency hedge fund. In interviews with various media outlets BankmanFried has denied any criminal wrongdoing or intent. Samuel Raymond and Andrew Rohrbach have been named as prosecutors in BankmanFrieds case court documents show. Among other cases Raymond handled the seizure of a painting looted by Nazi forces during World War II that was returned to its rightful owners in Ukraine. Rohrbach was one of the prosecutors leading the case against Jeffrey Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell who was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Judge Ronnie Abrams originally slated to preside over the BankmanFried court proceedings has recused herself after noting that her husbands law firm had advised FTX in 2021. The case has been reassigned to New York Southern District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan whos taken highprofile cases involving organized crime and art fraud. Separate from BankmanFrieds case the Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into 370 million that went missing just hours after FTX declared bankruptcy. The investigation will be led by the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team which the DOJ launched last year to focus on cybercrime associated with cryptocurrency.,2023-01-03T20:45:00Z,"

37,Fundstrat's Tom Lee highlights the biggest risk to his bullish 2023 stock market outlook of more than 20% gains,"""If [wages] begin to accelerate it means the Fed has a lot more wood to chop and that raises the risk,"" Lee said.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-tom-lee-biggest-risk-2023-forecast-inflation-2022-12,Fundstrats Tom Lee expects the SP 500 to soar more than 20 in 2023 to 4750 as inflation cools off. But he highlighted a big risk to his forecast on Friday that centers around sticky wages and a hawkish Federal Reserve. If wages begin to accelerate it means the Fed has a lot more wood to chop and that raises the risk Lee said. Fundstrats Tom Lee is the biggest bull on Wall Street as his 2023 SP 500 price target of 4750 exceeds Wall Streets median forecast by 17. But during an interview with CNBC on Friday he acknowledged theres a big threat next year that could derail his bullish outlook. The risk remains that the Fed has to stay tighter and therefore it actually doesnt lead to a soft landing it leads to an outright recession and maybe even a financial crisis. So I think the thing that remains the biggest risk is if wages actually accelerate Lee said. His bull case hinges on inflation continuing to decline and a friendlier Federal Reserve leading to a soft landing in the economy that makes corporate earnings more resilient than most expect. So its no wonder that a more hawkish Fed could sabotage Lees upbeat prediction. In fact thats exactly what happened in 2022. Fed Chair Jerome Powell hiked interest rates by 425 basis points and started to reduce the Feds balance sheet which led to a swift riskoff market environment that ultimately sank Lees initial 2022 SP 500 price target of 5100. The SP 500 is poised to end 2022 at just above 3800. The Fed is currently expected to raise interest rates by at least 50 basis points in 2023 which would be made up of two 25basispoint hikes at its February 1 and March 22 FOMC meetings. To gauge whether the Fed will continue to hike interest rates Lee suggests investors focus their attention on wage growth because if wages grow too fast while other aspects of inflation continue to cool then the Fed may still feel the need to tighten monetary conditions further. If wages begin to accelerate it means the Fed has a lot more wood to chop and that raises the risk he said.,2022-12-30T18:03:21Z,No Headline,Extremely Negative,190,-,-,-,businessinsider

Brody noted that transparency claims made by crypto firms were often difficult to test which makes the industry an insiders game. Policymakers have urged the SEC to tighten regulation on crypto firms criticizing the current handsoff approach. FTXs collapse shows that crypto contagion isnt over and the lack of transparency in the industry means crypto is an insiders game according to EYs head of blockchain Paul Brody. Were definitely not done with the contagion Brody said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday. People said crypto is going to be better because its going to be transparent and theres no politically motivated central bank in this ecosystem. Its turned out to be quite the opposite. Crypto is extremely nontransparent. Thats been exposed with the collapse of prominent crypto firms this year with companies like Terra Luna and Sam BankmanFrieds FTX declaring bankruptcy setting off a domino effect of other collapses in the industry. FTXs bankruptcy in particular revealed chaotic recordkeeping within the crypto exchange and extravagant purchases using company funds rattling the trust of its former users. But the problem is deeper than just bad actors in the industry Brody said. Users often dont have the ability to fully evaluate crypto firms for themselves even when businesses are transparent with their algorithm. He noted that his own team finds transparency claims among crypto firms difficult to test and follow through. In some cases thats absolutely by design he said. You follow all the rules but the rules are complicated and so therefore its an insiders game. Brody predicted customers would start to look to firms in the space that they could trust and were inspected by regulators adding to a chorus of market commentators who have urged government agencies to tighten the screws on crypto firms.

Low unemployment high household balance sheets and low corporate leverage are supportive of the economy. Inflation will stay elevated so the Fed isnt likely to pivot away from rate hikes until late 2023 according to John Woods. Its hard to believe the US will tip into recession this year according to Credit Suisses chief investment officer for Asia Pacific. Speaking to CNBC Wednesday John Woods said the Swiss bank sees only a 40 chance of a 2023 recession compared with a market consensus of around 5055. Im not entirely sure we are expecting a recession with any meaningful probability he said. Low unemployment high household balance sheets and low corporate leverage are key factors underpinning Woods view. Right now unemployment is extremely low household balance sheets in an absolute sense are extremely high corporates are not particularly leveraged and in those circumstances its hard to anticipate a recession certainly developing in the first half of this year he said. Woods view is at odds with most recent Wall Street forecasts for the US economy. A majority of analysts and market commentators have warned of a recession in 2023 with some of the worlds biggest banks including JPMorgan Morgan Stanley and Bank of America expecting US stocks to fall 20 or more this year as the economic downturn sets in. The pessimistic view comes on the backs the Federal Reserves aggressive monetary tightening campaign over the past year which many market experts say is hurting the economy. The central bank has boosted benchmark rates toward 4. 5 from almost zero last March to contain inflation that hit 40year highs last summer. While Woods debases the recession argument he said he anticipates more Fed rate hikes in the first or second quarter of 2023. I disagree with this concept or idea that there will be a rapid pivot anytime soon. I think inflation will remain elevated and I think interest rates will remain elevated he said. If there was a pivot itd probably be in the fourth quarter of this year more likely in the first quarter of next year because my sense is the Fed remains committed meaningfully to ensuring inflation is well under control he added.,2023-01-12T12:07:08Z,71 top VCs landed on Insider's 2022 list of investors to watch.

Timothy Massad noted that many exchanges werent registering with the SEC and claiming that tokens were commodities not securities. That reluctance to follow rules that protect clients is among the biggest risks in the crypto space he said. A lack of regulation is not the problem with crypto but rather the fact that exchanges simply are not following rules that are already in place according to former Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Chair Timothy Massad. Massad pointed to the Securities and Exchange Commissions existing rules to protect investors. But many crypto exchanges just arent registered with the regulator and are claiming that crypto tokens arent securities though SEC chief Gary Gensler has said that they are. The real issue here is that the basic investor protection standards we have in the securities market and the derivatives market arent being observed by these trading platforms. And by that I mean the rules weve developed over decades to protect customer assets to prevent a trading venue from operating a conflicting business and having conflicts of interest rules to prohibit fraud and manipulation the trading platforms arent observing those he said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. Many crypto exchanges have claimed that cryptocurrencies are commodities Massad said which places them in a regulatory loophole as there is no federal oversight over the commodities spot market. The reluctance to follow rules for securities is a major risk for trading crypto he added urging regulators to enforce common standards for commodities and securities in the crypto space. That includes limiting how much exchanges can leverage and limiting the extent a exchange can be involved with conflicting businesses. We have to have much tougher standards on protecting customer assets Massad said.

They told us they want a weak economy. I think thats a very friendly way of saying you want a recession Harris warned. He predicted the central bank would raise rates another 75basispoints and wont be stopped by recession warnings. The Federal Reserve wants a recession and is desperate to convince markets its serious about bringing inflation down according to Bank of Americas chief economist Ethan Harris. They are trying desperate to convince the markets they are serious here Harris said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday pointing to the minutes from the Feds December meeting. Central bankers reiterated their view that they would keep interest rates restrictive and continue hiking to 5. 1 in 2023 though bond markets are pricing in a lower Fed funds rate and stocks are still strong. Markets dont believe the Feds serious about fighting inflation. I think theyre wrong. I think the Fed will deliver more than the market is expecting he said. That echoes the views of other economists who have warned that the central bank was unlikely to back down on its aggressive monetary tightening regime to prevent inflation running out of hand. Prices have barely cooled from a 41yearhigh this summer despite the fact that officials raised rates 425basispoints last year to lower inflation. Interest rates at this level risk tipping the economy into a recession though the Fed could be willing to take that risk in order to drive their inflation fight home Harris warned especially since inflation indicators like the labor market are still running hot. And while inflation cooled to 7. 1 in November thats largely due to shortterm variables Harris said and the Fed is focusing on longterm inflationary pressures. They told us they want a weak economy. I think thats a very friendly way of saying you want a recession Harris warned. The fact that the signals that a recession is coming isnt going to stop the Fed. Harris said the Fed would continue hiking rates until they saw clearer evidence of a cooling job market and lower services inflation.

He sees the index reaching 4625 as long as inflation keeps dropping and the Fed eases its aggressive monetary policy. But volatility could also shape the market in 2023 he warned foreseeing a hop a drop and a pop in stocks. Stocks could jump this year as long as inflation keeps coming down and the Federal Reserve backs off from its aggressive monetary policy according to Piper Sandler chief market technician Craig Johnson. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday he predicted the SP 500 could rally to 4625 which is about an 18 gain from the indexs current levels. He pointed to improving macroeconomic backdrop after a dismal year for stocks in 2022 when the SP 500 lost 20 largely due to a strong US dollar and the Fed raising interest rates to battle inflation. But those pressures have eased in recent months Johnson said which could be bullish for equities. The US dollar has slipped 10 since September and the Fed has slowed its pace of interest rate hikes as inflation continues to moderate. After dialing down its increases from 75 basis points to 50 basis points last month the Fed is expected to lift rates by 25 basis points in February. Those have set up stocks for a small rally in recent weeks with the SP 500 up 4 from the start of the year. That momentum could be boosted by the release of the December Consumer Price Index report on Thursday a key inflation measure that will influence the Feds outlook on rate hikes throughout 2023.

S. judge overseeing Sam BankmanFrieds criminal case to make public the names of two people who helped guarantee the FTX cryptocurrency exchange founders 250 million bond. Saying the public interest cannot be overstated lawyers for the outlets including Reuters said the publics right to know BankmanFrieds guarantors outweighed their privacy and safety rights. In a letter to U. S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan the lawyers distinguished the case from another judges December 2020 decision not to reveal who guaranteed a bond for British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell then accused and later convicted of aiding in financier Jeffrey Epsteins sex crimes. While Mr. BankmanFried is accused of serious financial crimes a public association with him does not carry nearly the same stigma as with the Jeffrey Epstein child sex trafficking scandal lawyers for the outlets wrote. Media seeking to identify BankmanFrieds sureties also include the Associated Press Bloomberg CNBC Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones the Financial Times Insider and the Washington Post. The New York Times has asked separately for the names. A spokesman for Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell who represent BankmanFried declined to comment. Cohen and Everdell also represented Maxwell in her criminal case. In seeking to keep the sureties names under wraps BankmanFrieds lawyers said their clients parents who cosigned the 250 million bond had been harassed and received physical threats since FTXs early November collapse and bankruptcy. The lawyers said there was serious cause for concern the additional sureties might suffer similar treatment if their names went public. BankmanFried has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges that he looted billions of dollars at FTX in part by diverting customer deposits to support his Alameda Research hedge fund buy real estate and make political donations. His parents Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried are Stanford Law School professors. Bankman who has not been accused of wrongdoing has hired his own lawyer in the case according to a person familiar with the matter.

48,‘Maybe we cried too much’: Walgreens hints it exaggerated shoplifting surge,"Financial chief James Kehoe admits company may have overstated purported problem, which prompted rightwing outrage over crimeA major US drugstore chain that supposedly experienced a surge in shoplifting last year – fanning the flames of conservative outrage o…",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/06/walgreens-shoplifting-surge-chief-financial-officer,A major US drugstore chain that supposedly experienced a surge in shoplifting last year fanning the flames of conservative outrage over a purported spike in crime and disorder said on Thursday that it might have overstated the problem. Walgreens chief financial officer James Kehoe said during an earnings call that shrinkage the difference between a balancesheet inventory and actual stock had returned to lower levels after a brief rise. Retail shrinkage is largely due to theft though some is also due to accidental damage or loss. Maybe we cried too much last year when we were hitting numbers that were 3. 5 of sales Kehoe said according to an earnings call transcript. Were down in the lower twos call it the mid2. 5 2. 6 kind of range now. Conservative politicians and commentators have invoked a purported spree of shoplifting part of an effort to cast Democratic officials and reformminded prosecutors as soft on crime. Walgreens added fuel to the fire last year when it said it was closing several of its San Francisco stores due to retail theft that could not be stopped despite security investments. The company hired private security at some stores and at least one outlet put ice cream under lock and key. Those approaches were excessive Kehoe admitted on Thursday. Weve put in incremental security in the stores in the first quarter actually probably we put in too much and we might step back a little bit from that he said. The chain part of the Walgreens Boots alliance would shift more toward relying on law enforcement rather than private security companies as the security companies are proven to be largely ineffective Kehoe said. Other retailers have recently stuck by their contention that theft of some kinds is up. Walmart claimed it was struggling with an increase in shoplifting and warned of consequences such as increased costs and potential store closures. Theft is an issue. Its higher than what it has historically been the company chief executive Doug McMillon told CNBC. However McMillon said that this has largely stemmed from organized retail theft rather than oneoff shoplifting. While shoplifting might not have hurt Walgreens bottom line as much as it once thought the company said it suffered a 3. 7bn loss in its first quarter partly relating to litigation over the US opioid epidemic which has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans in the last decade. Walgreens reached an opioidrelated settlement with state and local governments last quarter to pay 5. 7bn over 15 years.,2023-01-06T17:38:06Z,Three things people in Finland—the "happiest country in the world"—never do,Extremely Positive,30,"skeptical, breaking, overlook, break",-,"Frank, Martela, Martelas, Kell, onni",-

I think he wanted to step down Trump told One America News. Former President Donald Trump thinks Elon Musk polled people about whether he should remain the CEO of Twitter knowing he would lose. I think he wanted to step down. I think thats a good way of stepping down you know just losing a poll and saying Im outta here Trump said of Musk during an appearance on One America News on Tuesday. Trump was referring to the poll Musk posted on Twitter on Sunday where 57. 5 of over 17. 5 million people voted for him to step down as the CEO of Twitter. On Tuesday Musk tweeted that hell step down as Twitter CEO when he finds someone foolish enough to replace him. When asked on One America News if he had any advice for Musk Trump said Musk needs a replacement who wears a lot of different hats. Thats not an easy thing to find in that world you need technology you need politics. You need sort of everything Trump said. And you have to have business sense a good business sense. So its going to be interesting to see who that is. Trump also lauded Musk for releasing the Twitter Files which showed thenpresidential candidate Joe Bidens campaign asking Twitter in 2020 to remove tweets including nude photos and videos about Bidens son Hunter Biden. Its a very important part of his legacy Ill tell you that Trump said of the Twitter Files calling them more important than anything else Musk has done. Id say hes a hero Trump added. Trump and Musk have had a rocky relationship over the years. Before the 2016 election Musk told CNBC Trump shouldnt be president. In December 2016 Musk was appointed to two economic advisory councils under the Trump administration. Musk left the posts on June 2 2017 when Trump said the US would pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The two started to feud openly in 2022. In July Trump called Musk a bullshit artist and accused him of lying about his voting history. After Trumps comments Musk tweeted that it might be time for Trump to give up on being president again. I dont hate the man but its time for Trump to hang up his hat sail into the sunset Musk tweeted on July 11. Dems should also call off the attack dont make it so that Trumps only way to survive is to regain the Presidency. In November Musk reinstated Trumps Twitter account. Trump has not tweeted from his reinstated account sticking instead to posting from his own platform Truth Social. Representatives for Trump and Musk did not immediately respond to Insiders requests for comment.

51,Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel channels Warren Buffett in explaining the problem behind Tesla's epic stock price decline,The philosophies of two market gurus have collided as Jeremy Siegel weighs in on the ongoing Tesla stock crash.,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jeremy-siegel-warren-buffett-tesla-stock-price-crash-elon-musk-2023-1,Jeremy Siegel used a quote from Warren Buffett to explain the problem behind Teslas epic stock price decline. Its far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price Buffett once said. The problem with Tesla was always the price and I think thats the bottom line Siegel said. Teslas epic stock price decline has been jarring to many investors but not Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel who channeled Warren Buffett in explaining the problem behind the stock. Tesla stock has erased just over 900 billion in market value over the past year with the stock price falling more than 70 from its record high. The decline accelerated in recent months after CEO Elon Musk acquired Twitter for 44 billion. What might be confusing to some investors is the fact that as Tesla continues to decline with the stock price down another 13 on Tuesday the underlying business continues to grow at a fast clip. Tesla announced fourthquarter deliveries of just over 405000 on Monday falling short of Wall Street forecasts but representing yearoveryear growth of 31. For the fullyear the company delivered just over 1. 3 million vehicles representing yearoveryear growth of 40. But none of that matters according to a Friday CNBC interview with Siegel. Warren Buffett said fall in love with the price of a stock. Dont fall in love with the company Siegel said. The full Buffett quote Siegel may be referring to is Its far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price. The problem with Tesla was always the price and I think thats the bottom line Siegel said. When Siegel says price he is referring to Teslas valuation which has been skyhigh since it started producing profits in 2021. According to data from YCharts Tesla currently trades at a forward pricetoearnings ratio of about 25x which is its lowest level ever. For much of 2022 Tesla traded at a valuation multiple of more than 60x and it peaked at over 180x in late 2021. Im old enough to remember when everyone fell in love with Polaroid in 1975 and sent it up to 95 times earnings Siegel said. Polaroid was a nifty fifty stock a term attributed to a group of largecap blue chip US stocks that were seen by investors as immune to broader market woes in the 1960s and early 1970s. The fervor for these stocks sent their valuations to ranges so high that some never revisited those levels ever again like Polaroid. Well I dont think Tesla is going to have the same fate as Polaroid but every stock that was sent up over 50 times earnings performed extremely poorly in the future. Its the price its not the company that causes investors problems Siegel said.,2023-01-03T18:39:45Z,Trump thinks Elon Musk's poll about his future as the CEO of Twitter was a good exit strategy: 'I think that's a good way of stepping down',Generally Neutral,280,"lose, lose, losing, foolish, rocky, lying, hate, hang, falls","hell, nude, bullshit, Communist","Trump, Elon, Musks, Donald, Trump, Elon, Musk, Trump, Donald, Trump, Elon, Musk, Trump, Musk, Trump, Musk, Musk, Musk, Trump, Musk, Trump, Trump, Musk, Joe, Bidens, Bidens, Hunter, Biden, Trump, Musk, Trump, Trump, Musk, Musk, Trump, Musk, Trump, Musk, Trump, Trump, Musk, Trumps, Musk, Trump, Trump, Musk, Trumps, Musk, Trumps, Trump, Trump, Musk, Jack, Ma",businessinsider

They will probably stay restrictive too long too long Lakos warned. The Federal Reserve isnt going to make things easy for the market and stocks still have at least 7 more to fall before hitting a bottom according to JPMorgans chief equities strategist Dubravko Lakos. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday he warned that expectations for corporate earnings are still too high as the 10 largest companies in the SP 500 are seen reporting a 10 increase in earnings this year. We think that in the first part of the year we still continue to face a pretty fair deal of headwind on the earnings side Lakos said pointing to the disinflation in goods prices but sticky inflation in wages. I think thats a pretty bad combination for profit margins. He predicted the SP 500 will dip at least to 3600 representing a 7 decline from current levels particularly since central bankers are expected to keep interest rates restrictive. The Fed hiked interest rates by 425 basis points last year to rein in inflation leading the SP 500 to sink 20 for its worst losses since 2008. Fed officials have signaled theyll keep rates high throughout 2023 which could tip the economy into a recession and spell nearterm trouble for equities I dont think the Fed is going to make it easy for the market. They will probably stay restrictive too long too long. Thats going to continue to result in a flush Lakos warned. He pointed to the trillions of dollars wiped out of the crypto market and the 700 billion valuation dent in Tesla a sign that retail traders are panicking. Economists have also warned that the Fed wont dial back rate hikes to buoy stocks as that risks stagflation a scenario where inflation expectations become entrenched in the economy. That could slam the economy with high unemployment low growth and high prices which could do more serious damage than a recession according to top economist Mohamed ElErian.

53,Travel credit cardholders may have a harder time redeeming rewards this year,Airlines and card issuers are raising redemption thresholds on loyalty perks as travel demand roars back.,https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/travel-credit-cardholders-may-have-harder-time-redeeming-rewards-this-year,The news Airlines and card issuers are raising redemption thresholds on travel perks to maintain a sense of exclusivity for things like airport lounge access and elite status for loyalty programs per CNBC. American Express will charge Platinum cardholders 50 for each guest they bring to Centurion airport lounges starting next month. Previously cardholders could bring two guests for free. American Airlines Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are increasing the spending requirements for some of their elite frequent flier tiers. Why the change A surge in travel demand combined with pandemicera policy changes has led to busier airport lounges and maxedout capacity for premium airplane seats. Airline executives are worried that this will ruin the appeal of their premium loyalty program benefits which were once harder to earn Delta is making policy changes because if everyones special no one feels special CEO Ed Bastian said. How we got here Many airlines lowered the requirements for elite travel perks in late 2020 to encourage spending. American Airlines for example waived the airfare spending requirements needed to achieve elite status in its AAdvantage loyalty program if customers spent at least 30000 on eligible AAdvantage credit cards which are issued by Citi. These types of promotions helped boost business for airlines and their issuing partners. But now that travel demand has come roaring back some airlines want to retire those changes to preserve an air of exclusivity for their loyalty programsand potentially to cut costs. Why its worth watching Some of the policy changes coming down the pike could risk alienating cardholders. That could have consequences for the large amount of money many airlines sweep in each year through cobrand card deals with issuers Delta expects its nonticket revenueswhich includes its partnership with Amexto account for 57 of overall sales in 2023. Many consumers with travelfocused credit cards hoarded points throughout the pandemic and are now using them to book travel. But it may become harderor at least more expensiveto redeem points toward indemand travel as airlines and issuers pivot their loyalty strategies. Twentynine percent of US adults said transferring rewards to loyalty programs was extremely valuable according to our US Premium Travel Credit Card Emerging Features Benchmark 2022. Twentyone percent said the same for paypervisit access to airport lounges To make up for those changes issuers may compensate with nontravel perks.,2023-01-10T15:27:52Z,"The Fed isn't going to make things easy for the market and stocks still have at least another 7% to fall, JPMorgan's chief equities strategist says",Somewhat Negative,330,"fall, restrictive, restrictive, warned, fall, warned, sticky, bad, decline, restrictive, sink, worst, losses, recession, trouble, restrictive, warned, dent, panicking, warned, risks, damage, recession, recession",-,"Dubravko, Lakos, Lakos, Dubravko, Lakos, Lakos, Lakos, Mohamed, ElErian",businessinsider

Miller told CNBC on Friday that Tesla is starting to lose market share as more electric vehicles hit the road. Its a phenomenal company but its not worth 380 billion. I shorted it recently Miller said. Legendary value investor Bill Miller said he is shorting Tesla stock due to the growing threat of competition. I think Tesla has been a phenomenal company. I think Elon Musk is a genius Miller admitted in an interview with CNBC on Friday before highlighting the fact that Teslas current valuation makes it seven time the size of General Motors 50 billion market cap. The main driver behind Millers short Tesla thesis is the fact that while the company owned the entire electric vehicle market for more than a decade thats no longer the case. All the major automakers are pivoting to electric vehicles and Tesla is starting to lose ground to them according to Miller. Tesla is now losing market share. Theyre cutting price. BYD is introducing a luxury car over in China. Its a phenomenal company but its not worth 380 billion in my opinion... I just dont think its worth more than the top five automakers in the world combined. And all of them are coming with electric vehicles Miller said. Aside from competition Millers bearish argument on Tesla also boils down to the ongoing debate between bulls and bears is Tesla a tech company or a car company According to Miller its a car company. And because its a car company its valuation is way too high. I think Tesla is too expensive. Tesla is much more profitable than the current auto companies. It has a lot of free cash flow. The earnings multiple if you consider it a tech stock is not out of whack certainly with its dominance in electric vehicles Miller said. But theres one big difference between Tesla and other tech stocks and thats the fact that the car business is not an attractive industry to realize outsized returns for investors. The difference between Tesla and other technology stocks is its selling into a bad business. The auto industry globally is a bad business. It has too much capacity and they earn low returns on capital. With Tesla its fighting a bad tide on that one Miller said. I shorted it recently. I shorted more today. If it goes up Ill short more Miller said.

Hes going to create breathing room for himself. This is the simplest and most obvious way for him to do it the socalled SPAC King said on a podcast. A Starlink IPO this year would be much earlier than expected. In 2022 Musk said a public offering was at least three to four years away. Elon Musk could take SpaceXs Starlink satelliteinternet business public this year according to Chamath Palihapitiya. In a recent episode of his AllIn podcast the socalled SPAC King said a Starlink IPO would be an obvious outcome in 2023. Musk talked about this on our pod about the difficulties and the dangers of margin loans and all of that stuff Palihapitiya said according to Bloomberg. Hes going to create breathing room for himself. This is the simplest and most obvious way for him to do it. Itll give him a ton of more dry powder. A Starlink IPO this year would be much earlier than expected. In 2022 Musk discussed the possibility of taking Starlink public during an all hands meeting for parent company SpaceX and CNBC reported that he suggested a Starlink IPO was three to four years down the line. Palihapitiya didnt provide any specific details that would explain why or when Musk could offer a Starlink IPO and he isnt especially close to Musk to be privy to such a plan. But he was involved in taking Virgin Galactic public and invested in space startup Relativity while his podcast cohosts Jason Calacanis and David Sacks were involved in Musks Twitter takeover Bloomberg said. Palihapitiya is known for taking startup firms public through special purpose acquisition companies also known as blank check companies that serve as an alternative to a traditional initial public offering. SPACs were an investor favorite for a large part of 2020 but have since floundered as markets continue to tumble on growing recession fears. Starlink which provides internet services via thousands of satellites gained more prominence last year in the wake of Russias invasion of Ukraine. SpaceX provided Kyiv with Starlink access to help the military coordinate its defenses against Russia while also providing the civilian population with continued internet service. Musk raised doubts about the future of Starlinks contributions to Ukraines defense effort when the company said in October it could no longer afford to continue donating access and wanted the Pentagon to pay for the service. But he has since backtracked while Kyiv said in November that it will seek assistance from allies to pay for Starlink service.,2023-01-09T14:16:11Z,"Legendary investor Bill Miller says he's shorting Tesla because the EV maker has a looming competition problem: 'If it goes up, I'll short more'",Somewhat Negative,190,"stiff, lose, threat, lose, losing, bearish, expensive, bad, bad, bad",-,"Bill, Miller, Miller, Miller, Bill, Miller, Elon, Musk, Miller, Miller",businessinsider

Munster is bullish longterm and he believes shares are undervalued after a brutal 2022 selloff. I remain positive on this company. I think ultimately there are a few good reasons to own this in 2023 he told CNBC. Tesla stock has more downside ahead and investors should brace for as much as a 25 drop in future earnings amid recent price cuts according to Loup Ventures Gene Munster. I am a longterm believer in Tesla. I think that the shares are undervalued. Nearterm I would be cautious. I think that theres going to be some earnings pressure based on some of the discounting that has happened Munster said in an interview on CNBC on Tuesday. That comes shortly after Tesla announced it had missed its production and delivery targets in the fourth quarter causing shares to fall another 4 in early January. Shares of the car maker had a historically bad year in 2022 amid a wider selloff in high growth stocks and investors growing concern over Elon Musks focus on Twitter which he acquired in October. The companys stock shed 700 billion in market value last year. Last week the company slashed its prices in China by around 13. Munster told investors to expect a 25 cut to Teslas earnings in March as he expected more earnings discounts to come. That echoes the view of other Tesla analysts who have warned that the stock likely wont rebound until at least after it releases its fourth quarter earnings at the end of this month. There is this bias when a stock is down as much as Tesla just to want to own it Munster said. We want to own it in our funds. We dont own it yet because we want to optimize that opportunity. Munster has been particularly critical of Musk as the CEO has damaged Teslas brand through his chaotic takeover of Twitter. Musk stepping down as Twitter CEO could be bullish for Tesla stock Munster previously said adding that he was bullish on the EV maker over the longterm. I remain positive on this company. I think ultimately there are a few good reasons to own this in 2023.

57,"Don't snap up stocks just yet – but stay alert as the Fed could soon spark a rally by wrapping up its rate-hiking campaign, a JPMorgan strategist says","""We think they're close to wrapping it up, thank goodness,"" JP Morgan Asset Management strategist Phil Camporeale said Wednesday.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-rally-outlook-federal-reserve-pause-interest-rates-jpmorgan-2023-1,Investors shouldnt pile into stocks yet but should be ready to jump in a JPMorgan strategist said. He thinks the Fed could soon pause its ratehiking campaign which would lift US equity markets. We think theyre close to wrapping it up thank goodness Phil Camporeale told CNBC Wednesday. Investors shouldnt be buying US stocks yet but they should be on high alert for when the Federal Reserve wraps up its interest ratehiking campaign according to a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. Portfolio manager Phil Camporeale expects the US central bank to stop the monetary tightening soon given inflation is cooling towards the 2 target it wants to reach. The economy is at risk of slipping into a recession if the Fed presses ahead with outsized rate hikes much longer. Whats the benefit of them continuing to move so aggressively if the cost of those hikes puts undue uncertainty on the economy in a world where inflation is moving in the right direction Camporeale told CNBCs Closing Bell on Wednesday. We think theyre close to wrapping it up thank goodness he added. The Feds aggressive rate increases which saw the cost of borrowing rise from nearzero in March to the current level of around 4. 5 an addition of 450 basis points in total have weighed on stocks. Rising rates eat away at companies future cash flows which help make up their overall valuation. JPMorgan isnt telling investors to pile into stocks just yet the strategist said. It still gives US equities an underweight rating meaning it thinks they will offer lower returns than other assets like bonds. Thats because the impact of the Feds aggressive hiking cycle is still filtering through the stock market according to Camporeale. Plus the Fed sets its policy based on inflation data but experts such as Jeremy Siegel have said the official indicators lag the real amount of inflation in the economy by up to 18 months opening up the risk of mistakes. Were still underweight right now because the Fed last year did the quickest monetary tightening that they have ever done he said. Theyve moved by 450 before but theyve never done it that quickly. So there still remains uncertainty about what that lagdefective policy does he added. But the bank is readying itself for any potential Fedfueled rally by snapping up call options on some SP 500 stocks Camporeale said. Call options give investors the power to buy a stock at a certain price before a particular date. Right now were long some calls on the SP Camporeale told CNBC. Yes were underweight but were long calls that can get us back into the SP if that underweight is incorrect.

The shares have been hit by pandemic disruptions management issues and the wider market downturn. The media giants shares are trading close to an eightyear low. Disney stock has plunged 45 this year leaving it poised to deliver its worst annual performance in nearly five decades as a profusion of challenges continues to bedevil the media giant. Shares of Disney closed almost 5 lower Monday after the longawaited Avatar The Way of Water had a disappointing opening weekend in movie theaters. They rallied as much as 2 on Tuesday. The stock is now trading at 2014 levels on a splitadjusted basis and remains on track for its largest yearly decline since 1974 according to CNBC. The painful selloff has erased about 200 billion from Disneys market capitalization since March 2021. Disneys business stretches from blockbuster movies to TV shows cable channels theme parks resorts cruises retail stores video games and streaming entertainment. Unsurprisingly it was hit hard by the travel restrictions production disruptions and closures of cinemas stores and entertainment venues seen during the COVID19 pandemic. While most of its operations have now reopened they havent fully recovered yet. One bright spot has been Disney Plus which has grown its paid subscribers from about 27 million at the end of 2019 to 164 million as of October 1. Yet investors have balked at the streaming services rising costs which fueled a hefty 1. 5 billion operating loss in Disneys streaming division last quarter. Disney stock has also been caught up in a wider market downturn. Inflation has surged to 40year highs this year spurring the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates from virtually zero in March to over 4 today in a bid to slow the pace of price increases. However rising prices and borrowing costs are squeezing consumers and businesses. Theyre also dragging down asset prices and fanning fears of a recession and slump in company earnings next year. The entertainment titan weathered some bad publicity during Bob Chapeks tenure as CEO. However Bob Iger who masterminded Disneys acquisitions of Marvel Pixar and Lucasfilm took back the companys reins in November sparking an uplift in its stock price and revitalizing investors hopes of a turnaround.

59,"Tesla stock is broken, and it's premature to call a bottom as shares will continue to fall through January, Fundstrat strategist says","Tesla stock has broken since Elon Musk dumped his shares, and the stock is likely to keep falling in the near-term, Fundstrat's Mark Newton said.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-outlook-broken-elon-musk-quit-twitter-ceo-rally-2023-1,Tesla is clearly broken since Elon Musk dumped his shares according to Fundstrats Mark Newton. Newton said it was premature to believe a strong rally will take place and the stock likely has more nearterm downside. The biggest fallacy on Wall Street is that its immediately right to buy dips on something thats down 50 he warned. Tesla stock is broken and investors cant bet on the stock rebounding in the nearterm according to Fundstrat global stock strategist Mark Newton. The stock is clearly broken. For intermediateterm investors we almost need to get above the area it broke down to really think were going to start a much larger rally Newton said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday referring to the level around 206 a share from which is began to fall in November. Getting back up to those levels would mean nearly doubling the current stock price and investors cant really work that way Newton warned. That comes amid a dismal fourth quarter for Tesla with the stock dropping 60 in less than four months and wiping out 700 billion in market cap. The electric vehiclemaker missed its earnings target in the third quarter and fell short of production and delivery targets but the drop has largely been spurred by the Tesla CEO Elon Musk who dumped his own shares of Tesla to fund his 44 billion acquisition of Twitter. The purchase has rattled Tesla investors with some urging Musk to step away from the social media company as he faces growing criticism for his leadership style and political tweets and memes. The company is now in its most brutal selloff since it first went public in 2010. Musk has vowed to step down as Twitter CEO once finding a suitable replacement which analysts say could be bullish for Tesla stock. But a major rebound is unlikely in the nearterm Newton said. He noted the stock only starting falling two months ago meaning fundamentals were still weak. The biggest fallacy on Wall Street is that its immediately right to buy dips on something thats down 50. If 2022 has taught us anything its that it doesnt necessarily always work out well in a bear market he added. It could have a very sharp bounce but I think its premature to think about that level right here. Newton said there could be a buying opportunity for investors by the end of the month when Tesla releases its fourth quarter earnings though theres still nearterm downside ahead. He added that if the stock fell 10 through January there could be room for a 3050 rebound.,2023-01-05T14:17:38Z,"Disney stock has plunged 45% this year, putting it on track for its worst performance in nearly 5 decades",Extremely Negative,360,"worst, issues, downturn, worst, disappointing, decline, painful, hard, hefty, loss, downturn, slow, dragging, fears, recession, slump, bad",-,"Bob, Chapeks, Bob, Iger",businessinsider

Shares of Tesla have cratered more than 70 from their record high as investors grow concerned about Musks focus on Twitter. Youre no longer buying a company youre buying a human being Damodaran said. Elon Musks personality represents an overhang for Tesla stock and the EV company needs to break ties with Musks image in order to win back investors according to NYUs Aswath Damodaran. Tesla was worth more than 1 trillion at the start of 2022 as investors saw a promising future of growth ahead for the electric vehicle company that was being run by what many considered to be a true innovator. Investors attributed the Elon Musk premium as partly the reason why even though it only sold a fraction of the number of cars Tesla was worth more than Toyota Volkswagen Honda Ford General Motors and Mercedes combined. Today Tesla is worth 345 billion less than double Toyotas valuation of 219 billion. In recent months Tesla stock has crashed more than 70 to levels not seen since 2020 as investors grow concerned about Musks ongoing antics as the new CEO of Twitter and his divided attention running Tesla SpaceX and Twitter all at the same time. In order to win back investors Damodaran dubbed NYUs dean of valuation due to his expertise in value investing told CNBC on Thursday that its a double edged sword when a companys image is so closely tied to its leader. Its a danger buying a company thats so closely tied to a personality that youre no longer buying a company youre buying a human being Damodaran said. In a sense what youre getting here is a bet for or against Elon Musk. And thats all well and good when the perception of the leader is mostly positive but public perception can change on a dime. I think that Tesla needs to find a way to disconnect itself from personality and thats going to be tough to do because it is a company built in Elon Musks image. And once a company becomes equated with a person you run all kind of risks and Tesla investors are facing those risks Damodaran said. Investors are finally catching on to those risks as they push the Tesla board to reveal its succession plans in the event that Musk decides to focus his attention on his other business ventures. One of Teslas largest individual shareholders has called for Tesla to start searching for a new CEO amid the volatility. Meanwhile a Tesla shareholder in Iceland submitted a resolution for Tesla investors to vote on in May as to whether the board of directors should prepare and maintain a keyrisk report according to the LA Times.,2023-01-06T14:48:46Z,"Tesla stock is broken, and it's premature to call a bottom as shares will continue to fall through January, Fundstrat strategist says",Extremely Negative,520,"broken, dumped, downside, fallacy, warned, broken, broken, broke, fall, warned, dismal, missed, fell, dumped, rattled, criticism, brutal, unlikely, falling, weak, fallacy, downside, fell","premature, premature","Elon, Musk, Mark, Newton, Newton, Mark, Newton, Newton, Newton, Elon, Musk, Musk, Musk, Newton, Newton",businessinsider
61,Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel says the Fed needs to end its aggressive inflation-fighting policy and stop hiking rates now,"The Fed is likely overestimating inflation and needs to end its aggressive monetary policy now, top economist Jeremy Siegel said Thursday.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jeremy-siegel-fed-inflation-rate-hike-outlook-recession-risk-tightening-2023-1,The Fed needs to stop its aggressive inflationfighting policy now according to Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel. The top economist said the CPI had an upwards bias due to lagging indicators. Siegel has urged central bankers to stop aggressively hiking rates in order to avoid a recession. The Federal Reserve needs to end its aggressive inflationfighting policy and stop hiking interest rates now according to Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel. If Powell looks at the actual rate of inflation with good housing data not lagged housing data we are in a deflationary mode. It is time to stop raising rates the top economist said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. Inflation has been elevated above the Feds 2 target for well over a year now but the Core Consumer Price Index has an upwards bias Siegel said which means that officials could be overestimating the actual rate of inflation and therefore do not need to tighten policy as much as they think. He pointed to the fact that shelter prices are falling rapidly though those changes will likely lag behind official CPI by around 18 months. More current estimates of shelter inflation from Zillow and the Federal Housing Authority show that housing prices are actually falling. 7 monthtomonth a major drop in inflation considering that housing accounts for about a third of headline CPI and 40 of core CPI. The Feds committement to waging a fight it probably already won could spell trouble for the economy Siegel said. Central bankers raised interest rates 425basispoints last year to rein in inflation but rates that are restrictive could overtighten the economy into a recession he warned. December inflation clocked in at 6. 5 on Thursday inline with economists forecasts. But the lag in housing prices means thats around 30 to 40basispoints too high Siegel estimated who has urged the Fed for months to ease up monetary tightening efforts. Officials have signaled they will continue to hike interest rates past 5 this year. Markets are expecting another 25basispoint rate hike in February bringing the Fed funds rate target to 4. 54. 75. Other economists have warned that inflation still remains too big of a risk for the Fed to ease up on rate hikes now. Top economist Mohamed ElErian noted the Fed is trying to repair its credibility after mistakenly calling inflation transitory in 2021 and cant afford to let up on monetary tightening and let inflation expectations spiraling out of control.,2023-01-12T18:33:35Z,"Tesla needs to separate itself from Elon Musk's personality to win back investors after 75% crash, NYU's 'dean of valuation' says",Extremely Negative,280,"concerned, break, crashed, concerned, danger, risks, risks, risks, volatility",-,"Elon, Musks, NYUs, Aswath, Damodaran, Damodaran, Elon, Musks, Musks, NYUs, Aswath, Damodaran, Elon, Musk, Musks, Damodaran, Damodaran, Elon, Musk, Elon, Musks, Damodaran, Musk",entrepreneur
62,'Show Some Skin': Newly Released Surveys Reveal a Toxic Culture for Women at Nike,"The surveys, made available through a lawsuit and a motion from multiple publications, paint a troubling workplace culture.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/toxic-culture-for-women-at-nike-revealed/441680,Show Some Skin Newly Released Surveys Reveal a Toxic Culture for Women at Nike The surveys made available through a lawsuit and a motion from multiple publications paint a troubling workplace culture. Newly unsealed surveys paint a bleak picture of the toxic culture for women inside the Portlandbased sportswear giant Nike. The surveys known as the Starfish Surveys are an explosive part of 5000 pages of unsealed legal documents about an ongoing lawsuit against Nike for genderbased discrimination. Although employees took the surveys in 2018 the contents were only revealed to the public last month after a legal challenge from Insider The Oregonian and the Portland Business Journal. Nike employees filled out the surveys after being fed up with the company culture. According to the New York Times the surveys were then delivered in a packet to the CEO Mark Parker. The surveys expose sexual intimidation bullying and other toxic behavior in the Nike workplace. Maybe if you dressed nicer I would be on time a man at the company reportedly told a Nike female employee. Take that baggy jacket off and show some skin. A bad look for Nike Nike is among the most successful athletic apparel companies in the world. The company reported quarterly earnings this week that surpassed investors expectations and boosted their stock some 10 on the news per CNBC. But the companys reputation was upended in 2018 in the wake of the MeToo movement when women employees began speaking out internally and externally about a culture that was often belittling and demanding to them per NYT reporting at the time. Ten Starfish Surveys are now publicly available but employees say some 100 were collected per Insider. The surveys provide information about what employees experienced at the company. Per Insider many women said that HR was a joke and that women had no power to affect change society at the company that has been and continues to be disrespectful to women and that it is a boys club. Another woman said she walked into the company gym and saw an employee receiving oral sex from an employee who was not as high up the corporate ladder. One employee reported that a manager phoned in a favor to avoid getting in trouble for calling an employee under him a bitch. As Insider noted Nike lost several executives after the 2018 internal investigation. But one person Laura Salerno Owens an attorney for the victims in the gender discrimination case pushed back on the idea that the toxic behavior only applied to a small group of people which Nike said in 2018. It wasnt limited to one vertical or one department And it wasnt limited to one manager. This was a common experience throughout the company. Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

63,Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says there's 2 more years of pain before tech rally,"From explaining why he is so optimistic about India's growth story to delving into his own company's transformation in light of both micro and macro economic challenges and of course shedding light on the tech outlook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella holds forth …",https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-says-there-will-be-2-more-years-of-pain-before-a-massive-tech-rally-15578191.htm,Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the world specially the tech sector should brace itself for two more years of struggle before it can see growth again. According to Nadella the current downturn being experienced by the tech industry is because the demand spurred by the COVID19 pandemic has begun to cool down and that coupled with a recession in several parts of the world has resulted in a normalisation. How quickly life can turn upside down Indians bear brunt of Goldman Sachs layoffs IST3 Mins Read Explained Why the farmers are protesting in Bihars Buxar IST4 Mins Read Fixed deposits offering up to 9 interest rates Is it time to book FDs or wait for more hikes IST5 Mins Read That said Nadella expects the tech industry to experience a massive growth cycle after these two years of pain. I would say the next two years are probably going to be the most challenging because after all we did have you know a lot of acceleration during the pandemic and there is some amount of normalisation of that demand Nadella told CNBCTV18 during an interview adding There is a real recession in large parts of the world. And so the combination of pull forward and recession means we will have to adjust. Nadella added that he is extremely optimistic about India given its wealth of talent and opportunities. If we see all of the worlds software developers India is No. 2 already. And in fact when it comes to AI artificial intelligence projects India is No. 1. And so... this next phase is going to be an AI age and you have to be long on India Nadella said during the interview. There are three factors that add to his optimism about India he added. India is a hotbed for startups I think its No. 2 in the world in terms of startups Nadella said. Secondly what strikes me as just phenomenal is people upskilling themselves in India is double the global rate. And all thats translating ultimately into Indian growth into Indian productivity Nadella added. And finally the fact that India is growing at 67 percent is the cherry on the cake. Nadella said the most exciting fundamentally unique thing happening in India right now is that there is a recognition that the next stage is digital and it requires both private sector innovation and public sector participation. In the digital ecosystem progress is being seen in Indias identity system with the payment infrastructure now scaling into ecommerce and healthcare Nadella said. He also touched on the governments Bhashini programme which as per the official portal aims to enable all Indians easy access to the Internet and digital services in their own language and increase the content in Indian languages. The Bhashini programme is fantastic. Its basically saying every Indian company and every Indian citizen should have access to AI models that sort of democratise language. So that means I should be able to translate from Hindi to Telugu Tamil to Kannada or what have you without any impedance in any application and that to me is a very enlightened set of policies by the government the Microsoft CEO said. Nadella feels India is one of the exceptions to the challenges assailing many countries such as inflation recession et al. That said he said it wont be all smooth sailing this year. There are parts of India Middle East Latin America some of the other parts of Asia where things that are green. But I think 2023 will be much harder. So yes we want to be very cautious in our outlook he said. However Nadella added he was bullish right out of the gate in 2023. I think were going to have a supply cycle thats going to persist and a classic demand cycle there will be some economies that will go through a recession some deep others minor then inside of that there will be pockets of growth like India Nadella said. That he said means Microsoft will have to see to full operational focus making sure its expenses are in line with its revenue growth manage the short term but make sure its investing for the long term. Nadella further said it is time for the tech sector especially in the light of prevailing circumstances to take a deep look inwards and change with the times respond to the new economic reality. Referring to the recent dunking tech stocks took Nadella said The markets are smarter than us all. And I think they are reflecting on where the growth is coming from. He said while he doesnt equate stock performance with economic performance it is imperative to keep an eye on the GDP. If we believe software and digital infrastructure is going to be important in construction energy and manufacturing then longterm you have to be long on tech industry. That does not mean any company can ignore the shortterm view and stop evolving into a more efficient productive machine. Will we have to go through our own cycles around productivity Absolutely like anybody else. But in the short run what we have to focus on is our own productivity and making sure we are efficient Nadella said. I think overall quite frankly whether its for us at Microsoft or the tech sector its going to be very important to look inside and say Are we as efficient as we need to be to be competitive I mean at the end of the day just because we are a technology company doesnt mean that we are the most efficient at what we do Nadella said. Further Nadella said it is important to distinguish between what he terms as tech industry employment and tech employment. Overall tech jobs actually increased. Tech jobs now are coming in financial services in energy companies in retail even in manufacturing and thats healthy because in the long run all those employees are going to consume more tech infrastructure Nadella said adding When we think about our cloud business longterm were bullish because of the fact that theres more employment outside of the tech industry. Thats what were banking on.,2023-01-06T17:09:20Z,"

64,Fed's George: It will be key to hold rates up once hikes end - Reuters,"Kansas City Federal Reserve leader Esther George said on Thursday that she hopes the central bank will continue its efforts to shrink its balance sheet, while also warning that she believes the Fed will need to press forward with rate rises and keep them high…",https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/feds-george-it-will-be-key-hold-rates-up-once-hikes-end-2023-01-05/,Feds George It will be key to hold rates up once hikes end NEW YORK Jan 5 Reuters Kansas City Federal Reserve leader Esther George said on Thursday that she hopes the central bank will continue its efforts to shrink its balance sheet while also warning that she believes the Fed will need to press forward with rate rises and keep them high for some time once the tightening process ends. In an interview on CNBC George said she believes the Fed will need to lift a federal funds rate target now at between 4. 25 and 4. 5 to over 5 and stay there for some time... until we get the signal that inflation is really convincingly starting to fall back toward our 2 goal. George is retiring from the Kansas City Fed this month. She held a voting role on the ratesetting Federal Open Market Committee last year. The Fed veteran she started at the bank in 1982 was often one of the most hawkish policymakers serving at the central bank. She ended up voting against her colleagues preferred monetary policy stance in nearly half of her FOMC votes a record without compare among currently serving policymakers. In the interview George said her colleagues should press forward with their ongoing efforts to shrink the size of the Feds balance sheet. Along with its efforts to raise shortterm rates to combat high levels of inflation the Fed is reducing the size of its holdings of securities and cash. From a peak of nearly 9 trillion this summer the Fed now holds 8. 6 trillion as it sheds nearly 100 billion per month in bonds it now owns. The Fed has given no guidance about where it will stop its drawdown. A growing number of analysts believe the Fed may have to stop this year due to looming shortages of reserves in the banking system that would threaten its ability to have strong control over its interest rate target. I think its very important that the Committee follow through on its plans to significantly reduce the balance sheet George said. She noted that she still views the Fed using its balance sheet as a tool of monetary policy as experimental and full of the possibility of unintended effects on the economy. I think we still have a lot to learn about what the consequences are of these balance sheet policies George said. But she was not ready to say that Fed actions that doubled the size of its balance sheet over the course of the pandemic were wrong because it was unclear how that period of crisis would play out. George said that she doesnt believe the size of the Feds balance sheet has created major financial stability risks but said its something that needs watching. Some have argued Fed asset buying drives too much risktaking creating the rising threat of unexpected trouble. I think you always have to be concerned about financial stability George said. That doesnt mean I see something on the verge of blowing up but I think we know from history those things dont really manifest themselves until they do.

65,Amazon evades hefty fine in the EU by settling antitrust cases,Amazon is making changes to how it deals with sellers to settle two EU antitrust investigations that could have resulted in a fine worth 10% of the company's annual global turnover.,https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-reaches-settlement-with-eu-on-antitrust-cases,Amazon evades hefty fine in the EU by settling antitrust cases The retail giant has agreed to change the way it deals with marketplace sellers in order to settle the EUs antitrust probes. What you need to know Amazon has made a series of concessions to address the European Unions concerns over its use of the sellers data to gain market advantage. The online retail giant has agreed not to use the sellers data for its own retail business and inhouse products. Amazon has also committed to giving equal treatment to sellers when ranking their offers for the buy box button on its website. The EU could have imposed a fine of up to 10 of Amazons global annual turnover without these concessions. Amazons business is so immense that its constantly being watched by regulators worldwide not the least of which is the European Commissions antitrust watchdog. The regulators have been probing the retail giants marketplace practices since at least 2019 for antitrust violations some of which have now been addressed by the company. The EC has announced opens in new tab that Amazon agreed to make changes to its business practices in order to settle two antitrust probes. The regulators have accepted those concessions and will continue to monitor the company for at least the next seven years. Concerns about how Amazon leveraged its market dominance emerged as early as 2019 when the EC discovered that the company used the sellers data to adjust its retail strategy. This occurred in several of Amazons major European markets including France and Germany. The watchdogs investigation later concluded that this practice distorted fair competition on its platform and prevented effective competition. To address this concern Amazon has agreed to stop using nonpublic data from independent sellers to gain an unfair market advantage. The company has also stated that it will not use such information to sell its private label products. In a separate antitrust probe the EC was concerned that Amazons criteria for the buy box tool and Amazon Prime favored its own retail business and thirdparty sellers that use its logistics and delivery services. Moving forward the retail behemoth will give equal treatment to sellers when ranking their products for the buy box which appears on the right side of a product. Amazon will also display a second competing offer to the Buy Box winner if there is a second offer from a different seller that is sufficiently differentiated from the first one on price andor delivery. The company has also promised to make sure that discrimination against sellers in Amazon Prime will be a thing of the past. As for Prime members Amazon will give them the liberty to choose any delivery service. The EC will monitor Amazons compliance with its commitments pertaining to Prime and Buy Box for seven years. Meanwhile the rest of the commitments will be in effect for the next five years. If Amazon breaks them regulators may impose a fine of up to 10 of Amazons annual global turnover which could amount to 47 billion according to CNBC opens in new tab. Earlier this year Amazons business practices were also embroiled in an antitrust lawsuit in the United States for allegedly fixing thirdparty prices and undermining competition. This forced the company to shut down its Sold by Amazon program and pay 2. 25 million which looked like a negligible sum when compared to its revenues.

66,Video shows 8-car pileup after a Tesla allegedly using Full Self-Driving stopped in a highway tunnel,"The Tesla driver said at the time of the accident that he had been using the carmaker's Full Self-Driving software, The Intercept reported.",https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-stops-tunnel-pileup-accidents-driver-says-fsd-enabled-video-2023-1,Video shows 8car pileup after a Tesla allegedly using Full SelfDriving stopped in a highway tunnel Surveillance video shows a Tesla stopping in a San Francisco tunnel and the resulting eightcar pileup. The Intercept published the footage from November 24 on Tuesday. Surveillance footage from San Francisco Bay Bridge shows a Tesla coming to a stop within a highway tunnel and an eightcar pileup that followed according to a recent report from The Intercept. The accident which occurred on November 24 halted traffic on the road for over an hour and injured nine people including a 2yearold the publication reported. The Intercept obtained two surveillance videos from the incident via a public records request. At the time of the accident the Tesla driver told local police the car had been under the influence of Teslas Full SelfDriving FSD software and had moved into the left lane and come to a stop directly in front of another vehicle the publication reported citing a traffic crash report from the incident. Spokespeople from NHTSA and California Department of Transportation did not confirm whether the FSD feature was activated. The video from The Intercept reporter Ken Klippenstein shows the Tesla moving into the left lane with its blinker and quickly coming to a stop in front of another car. Ken Klippenstein kenklippenstein January 10 2023 On the day of the pileup a witness to the scene Shayna Kelly of San Francisco told KTVU that she saw the Tesla abruptly swerving. He just made a sudden stop she said. At that point there was nowhere to go. FSD is an addon to Teslas Autopilot driver assistance feature that enables the vehicle to automatically change lanes enter and exit highways recognize stop signs and traffic lights and park. The software is in beta testing and it still requires a licensed driver to monitor the system at all times. A spokesperson for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA told Insider the agency had launched an investigation into the crash. As of December 22 the agency has launched at least 41 investigations into Tesla crashes where automated features including automatic emergency braking and Autopilot or FSD were involved CNBC previously reported. On Monday Associated Press reported that the NHTSA as part of an investigation into multiple Tesla accidents is also reviewing a tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk in which the billionaire said he planned to update FSD software to get rid of a steering wheel monitoring feature for some drivers. Teslas FSD software has faced criticism in the past. Over the years beta testers have taken to YouTube to post examples of bugs in the software from phantom braking and attempts to turn into the wrong lane to incidents when the software appeared to fail to recognize pedestrians in the road. Last year the California Department of Motor Vehicles accused Tesla of deceptive marketing practices in the advertising of Autopilot and FSD. In 2021 a man was arrested after he was pulled over for riding in the back seat of his Tesla while using Full SelfDriving. Read the full story on The Intercepts website.

Staff and lawmakers in the House of Representatives have been ordered to uninstall TikTok from their iPhones iPads and Android devices. The US government has previously threatened to ban TikTok from the App Store entirely though deadlines for Apple and Google to comply were xjref. More recently despite the issue being outside the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission FCC commissioner Brendan Carr has been pressing for a total ban. Now according to CNBC the House of Representatives has instigated an immediate ban on the videosharing service for all its staff. The Houses Chief Administrative Officer Catherine L. Szpindor reportedly issued a memo after her cybersecurity staff concluded that TikTok represented a high risk to users due to a number of security risks. Consequently staff and lawmakers were directed to either not download the app or to uninstall it if they had already got it on their phones. House staff are NOT allowed to download the TikTok app on any House mobile devices said the memo seen by CNBC. If you have the TikTok app on your House mobile device you will be contacted to remove it. CNBC notes that part of the 1. 7 trillion omnibus spending bill passed by Congress earlier in December includes a TikTok ban. That bills measure regarded a ban of the app from some government devices plus all executive branch devices though not members of Congress and their staff. Similarly the new directive from the House does not apply to the Senate. TikTok has not commented publicly on the ban however it has previously said that it was working to meaningfully address any security concerns that have been raised at both the federal and state level. These plans have been developed under the oversight of our countrys top national security agencies plans that we are well underway in implementing to further secure our platform in the United States said the company and we will continue to brief lawmakers on them.

Many shady dispensaries have opened however. Family members of mine who live in the area and others who have visited them have regaled me with stories of how Manhattan is now a dope smokers paradise. Having seen this play out in other places we can count on the government wanting the tax revenue and this getting somewhat worked out but never perfectly. The licensing program in New York is years behind the states sophisticated black market. New York doled out its first set of dispensary licenses last month but recreational marijuana has been legal in the state for nearly two years. These shops are masquerading as safe legal entities said Trivette Knowles a press officer at the New York State Office of Cannabis Management but there are currently no licensed sales happening right now in the state of New York. The problem is particularly cumbersome in New York City Knowles said. Weed can be bought from brickandmortar storefronts trucks popup shops bodegas and even courier services that deliver directly to consumers. His office has sent out ceaseanddesist letters to some of the unlicensed operators in the state but some trade groups say there are likely tens of thousands of illegal businesses in the city alone.

It's the league's second major commitment to streaming in recent years.",https://www.npr.org/2022/12/22/1145025417/nfl-sunday-ticket-youtube-directv,NFL Sunday Ticket is headed to YouTube beginning next season Fans will have to Google it beginning next season if they want to access the NFLs Sunday Ticket package. The NFL announced a multiyear agreement on Thursday for Google to distribute the package of outofmarket Sunday afternoon games on YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime Channels. The NFL was seeking 2. 5 billion per season for the package which has been on DirecTV since 1994. The satellite provider has paid 1. 5 billion per year on an eightyear contract that expires at the end of this season. Commissioner Roger Goodell said during an interview with CNBC over the summer that the next move for Sunday Ticket would be to a streaming service because that would be the best option for fans. Goodell reiterated that with Thursdays announcement. For a number of years we have been focused on increased digital distribution of our games and this partnership is yet another example of us looking towards the future and building the next generation of NFL fans he said in a statement. It is the second time in less than two years that the NFL has partnered with a streaming service to air games. The leagues 11year contract with Amazon Prime Video for Thursday night games started this season. Besides Amazon Apple and ESPN also expressed interest in NFL Sunday Ticket. As the ways fans enjoy NFL football evolve in a changing media landscape partnerships with innovators like YouTube will ensure that more games are available to more fans said New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft who is also chairman of the NFLs media committee. This partnership will grow our game for future generations and allow them to follow their favorite sport. Technology How YouTube became one of the planets most influential media businesses How YouTube became one of the planets most influential media businesses The NFL has had a presence on YouTube since 2015 when it launched its official NFL channel. That has increased to include channels for all 32 teams and 10 official league channels including NFL Films NFL Network and Mundo NFL. NFL Network and NFL RedZone have been available to subscribers of YouTube TV since 2020. Through this expanded partnership with the NFL viewers will now also be able to experience the game they love in compelling and innovative ways through YouTube TV or YouTube Primetime Channels YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in a statement.

Google said in June that YouTube TV which was launched in 2017 had surpassed 5 million accounts and was the biggest internetbased pay TV service in the U. S. That number includes users on free promotional trials. YouTube Primetime Channels which launched in November is a service that allows users to subscribe and watch content from streaming services on the YouTube app. Even with Sunday Ticket moving to YouTube the price is not expected to substantially decrease due to contracts with CBS and Fox which carry the Sunday afternoon games. Viewers pay around 300400 a season for the package which averages 2 million subscribers. The league also said it would work with YouTube to determine additional ways to support distribution of Sunday Ticket in commercial establishments.

70,"NYC could lose 10,000 Airbnb listings because of new short-term rental regulations","The new short-term rental registration law, which will go into effect next month, could take thousands of Airbnb listings off the market.",https://www.npr.org/2022/12/28/1145709106/nyc-could-lose-10-000-airbnb-listings-because-of-new-short-term-rental-regulatio,NYC could lose 10000 Airbnb listings because of new shortterm rental regulations A new shortterm rental registration law put forth by the administration of New York City Mayor Eric Adams could remove thousands of Airbnb listings from the market next month. The San Franciscobased company which connects customers to shortterm housing accommodations across the globe is no stranger to conflict with New York City one of its largest markets in the United States. Previously the company sparred with former Mayor Bill de Blasio over listing regulations for shortterm rentals. In July the Adams administration filed a lawsuit to shut down an illegal shortterm rental operation in Manhattan. Earlier this month officials held a public debate with local Airbnb hosts over the new shortterm rental registration law. And on Tuesday Airbnb sent out an email to some of its users containing a form where people can complain to New York city officials about the new restrictions. Were reaching out because the City is set to enact a law that would drastically affect the ability of New York Hosts to continue sharing their homes the email reads. As a result shortterm rental accommodations for travelers like you will be dramatically reduced to hotels and a shared room with no locks. This will restrict travel options outside popular tourism areas and hurt small businesses throughout the city. The new measure which will go into effect in January will require Airbnb hosts to register their shortterm rentals with the citys database including proof that the hosts themselves reside there and that their home abides by local zoning and safety requirements. If Airbnb hosts fail to comply they could face 1000 to 5000 in penalty fees. A spokesperson for Airbnb said the new regulations will hurt average New Yorkers who are struggling to keep up with rising costs. Airbnb agrees regular New Yorkers should be able to share their home and not be targeted by the City and we urge the administration to work with our Host community to support a regulatory framework that helps responsible Hosts and targets illegal hotel operators Nathan Rotman public policy regional lead for Airbnb said in a statement to NPR on Wednesday. Christian Klossner executive director for the citys Office of Special Enforcement told the New York Daily News that he expects to see 10000 listings disappear after the new regulations go into effect. Every illegal shortterm rental in our city represents a unit of housing that is not available for real New Yorkers to live in New York State Senator Liz Krueger said in July following news of the lawsuit. In the middle of an ongoing affordable housing crisis every single unit matters. The measure comes at the same time that the cost of housing in New York City continues to rise. The median monthly rent for an apartment in Manhattan hit 4033 in November according to CNBC. And there now may be more Airbnb listings available than rentable apartments according to a recent report from Curbed. There are nearly 40000 Airbnb listings in New York City alone according to InsideAirbnb which tracks these numbers. More than half of those listings according to the database are for an entire home or apartment.,2022-12-28T10:00:43Z,NFL 'Sunday Ticket' is headed to YouTube beginning next season,Extremely Negative,420,-,"Primetime, Primetime, Primetime, Primetime","Roger, Goodell, Goodell, Robert, Kraft, Susan, Wojcicki, lawsuit",businessinsider
71,Google's management has reportedly issued a 'code red' amid the rising popularity of the ChatGPT AI,CEO Sundar Pichai has reportedly redirected teams to build out new AI products as concerns rise over ChatGPT's threat to Google.,https://www.businessinsider.com/google-management-issues-code-red-over-chatgpt-report-2022-12,Googles management has reportedly issued a code red amid the rising popularity of the ChatGPT AI Google issued a code red in response to the rise of AI bot ChatGPT NYT reports. CEO Sundar Pichai redirected some teams to focus on building out AI products per the report. Googles management issued a code red amid the launch of ChatGPT the buzzy conversational AI chat bot created by OpenAI as its sparked concerns over the future of the Google search engine The New York Times reported. Sundar Pichai the CEO of Googles parent company Alphabet participated in several meetings around Googles AI strategy and has directed numerous groups in the company to refocus their efforts on addressing the threat that ChatGPT poses on its search engine business according to an internal memo and audio recording reviewed by the Times. In particular teams in Googles research Trust and Safety division among other departments have been directed to switch gears to assist in the development and launch of new AI prototypes and products the Times reported. Some employees have even been tasked to build AI products that generate art and graphics similar to OpenAIs DALLE used by millions of people according to the Times. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to Insiders request for comment. Googles move to build out its AI product portfolio comes at a moment when Google employees and experts alike debate whether ChatGPT run by former Y Combinator president Sam Altman has the potential to replace the search engine and in turn hurt Googles adrevenue business model. Sridhar Ramaswamy who oversaw Googles ad team between 2013 and 2018 said that ChatGPT could prevent users from clicking on Google links with ads which generated 208 billion 81 of Alphabets overall revenue in 2021 Insider reported. ChatGPT which amassed over 1 million users five days after its public launch can generate singular answers to queries in a conversational humanlike way by synthesizing information from millions of websites. Users have asked the chat bot to write a college essay provide coding advice and even serve as a therapist Insider previously reported. But some have been quick to notice that the bot is often riddled with errors. ChatGPT is unable to factcheck what it says and cant distinguish between a verified fact and misinformation AI experts told Insider. It can also make up answers a phenomenon that AI researchers call hallucinations. The bot is capable of generating offensive responses that are racist and sexist Bloomberg reported. The chat bots high margin of error and vulnerability to toxicity are some of the reasons why Google is hesitant to release its AI chat bot LaMDA short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications to the public according to the Times. A recent CNBC report said Google execs are reluctant to release it widely in its current state over concerns over reputational risk. Chat bots are not something that people can use reliably on a daily basis Zoubin Ghahramani who leads the Googles A. I. lab Google Brain told the Times before ChatGPT was released. Instead Google may focus on improving its search engine over time rather than taking it down experts told the Times. As Google reportedly works full steam ahead on new AI products we might get an early look at them at Googles annual developer conference IO which is expected to take place in May.

72,"Tesla could still fall more than 60% if it's valued as a traditional automaker like Ford or General Motors, CIO says","If Tesla was valued 3x as much as Ford, it would be worth $135 billion, representing an 89% decline from its peak valuation of $1.2 trillion.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-traditional-automakers-valuation-ford-general-motors-gm-2023-1,Tesla is valued about eight times more than Ford and General Motors even though it makes far fewer cars. Greenwich Capital CIO Vahan Janjigian told CNBC that Tesla would plummet if its valued like a traditional automaker. Tesla saw its worst annual decline on record in 2022 falling more than 60 as investors grew weary of Elon Musks commitment to the company. Should Tesla be valued like a traditional automaker or a tech company That question has been at the center of a yearslong debate between investors and skeptics of the electric vehicle maker as bullish investors focus on its EV innovation selfdriving tech and forays into solar and energy storage as reasons why Tesla deserves a premium valuation to traditional automakers. But one thing is for sure if Tesla ever is valued like Ford or General Motors it has a lot more room to fall according to Greenwich Wealth Management chief investment officer Vahan Janjigian. He told CNBC on Wednesday that even after falling more than 60 in 2022 Tesla is still valued at about eight times more than Ford and General Motors despite selling millions of fewer cars each year. Both Ford and General Motors have a market cap of about 45 billion compared to Teslas valuation of just over 380 billion. In fact even after Tesla erased more than 700 billion in market value this year due to concerns about Elon Musks time commitment to the company its still worth more than the four biggest auto companies combined. Tesla I think is still tremendously overvalued despite its plunge this year... I think Tesla should be selling at a higher multiple than Ford and General Motors because it has much better growth prospects and they dominate the EV market. But this multiple is way too high Janjigian said. Tesla currently trades at a forward PE ratio of 21x compared to 6x and 5x at Ford and General Motors respectively. The only major auto company that has a higher valuation multiple than Tesla is Ferrari which has a gross profit margin thats about double Teslas due to its focus on selling highpriced luxury vehicles. If Tesla were valued by investors more like its automaker peers while maintaining a sizable premium due to its fast growth rate and technological innovations the company could see its value plunge even further according to Janjigian. Tesla is currently selling about 1 million cars per year. That number is going to grow. When I look at Ford which is selling approximately 5 to 6 million cars per year. I think Tesla will get up there so therefore under that argument I think it should be worth at least as much as Ford maybe twice as much as Ford maybe 3x as much as Ford. But 8x as much as Ford I think thats too high Janjigian said. If Tesla fell to a valuation that was three times as much as Ford it would be worth 135 billion. That would represent a 65 decline from current levels and an 89 decline from its peak valuation of more than 1. 2 trillion. Are they going to be the only car seller in the world Are they going to put all these other automobile manufacturers out of business If thats the case then they should be valued higher. But Ford is also making EVs. GM is making EVs. Every single manufacturer now is trying to grow their EV business and they have a lot of years of experience behind them... so I think that they will eventually catch up to Tesla Janjigian said.,2023-01-02T13:30:00Z,Google's management has reportedly issued a 'code red' amid the rising popularity of the ChatGPT AI,Extremely Negative,410,"concerns, threat, hurt, errors, unable, offensive, error, hesitant, reluctant, concerns, risk, falls","racist, Communist","Sundar, Pichai, Sundar, Pichai, Sam, Altman, Sridhar, Ramaswamy, Zoubin, Ghahramani, Jack, Ma",businessinsider
73,"Billionaire investor David Tepper is shorting the stock market heading into 2023 for one big, obvious reason: The Fed","""Sometimes they just tell you what they are going to do and you got to believe them. And I kind of believe them,"" David Tepper said, referring to the Fed.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/david-tepper-short-stock-market-dont-fight-fed-interest-rates-2022-12,Billionaire investor David Tepper is leaning short on the stock market heading into 2023. Tepper is bearish on stocks because of the ongoing tightening by central banks around the world. The upsidedownside doesnt make sense to me when I have so many central banks telling me what theyre going to do Tepper told CNBC. Billionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper is leaning short on the stock market heading into 2023 for the same reason that stocks performed so well in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis in 2009 dont fight the Fed. Sometimes they just tell you what they are going to do and youve got to believe them. And I kind of believe them Tepper told CNBC on Thursday referring to the Fed. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by more than 400 basis points so far this year in an attempt to squash 40year high inflation. Last week Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hiked rates by 50 basis points and indicated that the Fed Funds rate will rise another 75 basis points to about 5. 1 by the end of next year. The Fed terminal rate will likely reach a peak of 5. 25 and theyre going to keep rates high for a while Tepper said. Thats because while inflation has no doubt fallen since its annualized peak at 9. 1 in June theres still a lot more to do if the Fed is going to get inflation down to its 2 target. Central banks are nervous about inflation staying persistently at 4 and theyre getting ahead of that with their continued tightening Tepper explained. Its not just the Feds raising interest rates poses a threat to the stock market. Its also its balance sheet reduction plans as it reduces its massive 8. 6 trillion balance sheet by 95 billion per month. With the Fed shifting to selling bonds rather than buying them that sucks liquidity out of markets and stocks love liquidity. And whats more Tepper highlighted is its not just the US Fed getting tight with its monetary policy but central banks around the world. The Bank of England and the European Central Bank are both in tightening mode with the projection that they will continue to hike interest rates next year. I got everybody tightening and telling me theyre going to tighten more and I got markets that just dont believe it Tepper said. We dont have coordinated tightening around the whole world with everybody tightening at the same time too often. Tepper said that higher interest rates also mean tough competition for other assets like stocks given that an investor can collect an attractive riskfree return of about 45 and that return rate is likely to go higher next year if the Fed continues with its hikes. I hate when I have coordinated tightening. We have coordinated tightening. I got three other central banks telling me theyre going to do more Tepper said. According to data from Bank of America central banks around the world have raised interest rates nearly 300 times this year. Theyre not happy to have asset inflation here. What am I supposed to do fight them Tepper said. And thats exactly why Tepper is not particularly optimistic about the stock market in 2023. Im leaning short on the equity markets because I think the upsidedownside doesnt make sense to me when I have so many central banks telling me what theyre going to do what they want to do and what they expect to do Tepper said. This is going to be a tough level to talk about robust returns in the next year particularly when you have the Feds in such a tightening mode.,2022-12-22T16:48:35Z,"Tesla could still fall more than 60% if it's valued as a traditional automaker like Ford or General Motors, CIO says",Somewhat Negative,190,"worst, decline, falling, weary, fall, falling, concerns, fell, decline, decline",-,"Vahan, Janjigian, Elon, Musks, Vahan, Janjigian, Elon, Musks, Janjigian, Janjigian, Janjigian, Janjigian",businessinsider
74,Sam Bankman-Fried's attorneys are bringing experience working on 'El Chapo' and Ghislaine Maxwell cases to the crypto exec's defense,"Sam Bankman-Fried, who is facing two counts of wire fraud and six conspiracy counts, pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court last week.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sbf-sam-bankman-attorneys-el-chapo-ghislaine-maxwell-defense-experience-2023-1,Sam BankmanFrieds lawyers have experience working on big cases related to drug lord El Chapo and Ghislaine Maxwell. Attorneys Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell are former federal prosecutors who are now partners at Cohen Gresser. Last week BankmanFried pleaded not guilty to six conspiracy counts and two counts of wire fraud. FTX founder Sam BankmanFrieds attorneys are no stranger to highprofile court cases. Christian Everdell and Mark Cohen have worked on cases involving drug lord El Chapo and convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell according to the Wall Street Journal. The former federal prosecutors who are now partners at Cohen Gresser are known for an unflashy rolluptheirsleeves style to cases with a meticulous and persistent approach to building a defense the WSJ report states citing lawyers who know the men. Everdell was a part of the team that charged Joaqun El Chapo Guzmn Loera while working as a federal prosecutor from 2007 to 2016. The infamous drug lord was convicted in 2019 on nearly a dozen counts related to the activities of the Sinaloa drug cartel. Meanwhile both attorneys were part of the defense team of Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell who was convicted in 2021 on charges of sex trafficking. Cohen started the boutique law firm with attorney Lawrence Gresser. Founded in 2002 Cohen Gresser now has more than 80 lawyers and expanded offices in New York Washington London and Paris. BankmanFried who is facing two counts of wire fraud and six conspiracy counts pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court last week. Crypto exchange FTX allegedly misused billions in customer deposits for daily operations in BankmanFrieds hedge fund Alameda Research. The pair of attorneys navigated BankmanFrieds tricky extradition process from the Bahamas to US custody. Later legal counsel negotiated with US prosecutors to get their client pretrial release to his parents Palo Alto home on a 250 million bond agreement. The agreement dubbed an recognizance bond did not require payment upfront but a promise to comply with certain restrictions before the 30yearolds trial in October along with 10 of the bail amount in collateral. Cohen previously worked in the US attorneys office in Brooklyn where he worked on securities and business fraud cases for some time. He had a reputation for questioning witnesses in a way that jurors respected lawyer Mark Kirsch told the Wall Street Journal. FTXs stunning collapse is one of the biggest financial frauds in American history Damian Williams the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York said after BankmanFrieds arrest in December. Legal counsel from New Yorkbased firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton Garrison previously advised the dethroned exec before charges were announced. People familiar with the matter told the news outlet that there there was a conflict and BankmanFried was later referred to Cohen. Its going to be a tough case for BankmanFrieds legal team though. Prosecutors have swiftly secured two of the BankmanFrieds former top execs as cooperating witnesses. FTX cofounder Gary Wang and Alameda Researchs former coCEO both plead guilty and are working with investigators in the case. They have a mountain of paper evidence and in fact admissions by the defendant himself former federal prosecutor Danya Perry told CNBC last month. So theyre not going to be in any particular rush and theyre not going to be welcoming of any sweetheart plea deal.,2023-01-09T20:06:51Z,"Billionaire investor David Tepper is shorting the stock market heading into 2023 for one big, obvious reason: The Fed",Extremely Negative,390,"bearish, hedge, Crisis, squash, doubt, fallen, nervous, threat, sucks, hate","fight, fight","David, Tepper, Tepper, Tepper, David, Tepper, Tepper, Jerome, Powell, Tepper, Tepper, Tepper, Tepper, Tepper, Tepper, Tepper, Tepper, Tepper",businessinsider
75,"Save, don't spend, warns Intuit's CEO, as he notices 'good behavior' around money habits eroding","Americans are burning through their supply of early pandemic savings, but it's good to keep your debt total low in preparation for a recession.",https://www.businessinsider.com/save-money-prepare-for-recession-spending-habits-intuit-ceo-2023-1,Save dont spend warns Intuits CEO as he notices good behavior around money habits eroding Americans have been saving less and spending more. Thats partially due to inflation woes but spending on travel and recreation still remains high. The job market is strong but a recession this year is still not out of the cards. Sasan Goodarzi the CEO of Intuit a business software company told Insider that this means Americans should pay close attention to what theyre doing with their money because too much debt can limit your financial options during a recession. Americans were doing remarkably well financially for much of the pandemic. They paid off a record 83 billion in credit card debt in 2020 and four million fewer people had debt in collections in 2021 than in 2019. Thats largely due to an unprecedented boon in cash from stimulus checks and other pandemic aid along with reduced spending amid the pandemic. But with the economy open and help from the government at an end excess savings are depleting and consumers dont seem interested in watching their spending. Inflation has been eating into Americans wallets for the last two years but its not the only reason savings are falling. Spending has remained strong overall especially for inperson services that were especially constrained during the worst of the pandemic said Goodarzi. Coming out of the pandemic we see that consumers are spending less on goods and more on recreational services such as restaurants travel movies and museums he said. Demand for these types of recreational services remains strong. Were also starting to see some of the good behaviors developed during the pandemic like paying down debt and consumers increasing their credit score start to erode a bit he said. Americans stashed away 2. 4 of their savings in November according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis following a 2. 3 savings rate in October. Thats far below the savings rate of 12. 9 in November 2020 in the middle of the first Covid winter and below an average of 6. 3 prior to the pandemic according to SP Global Market Intelligence. Americans may say they are worried about inflation but they are still out shopping which keeps the economy growing for another quarter Christopher Rupkey chief economist at FWDBONDS told Reuters in October. Higher spending and lower saving is starting to impact peoples credit. Weve seen credit scores decline by 8 points throughout 2022 and average credit card balances are up 14 since March 2022 when the Fed first hiked rates Goodarzi said both indicating that consumers are beginning to fall behind financially. In general financial experts recommend tackling as much of your debt as possible in anticipation of a recession. Youll have more credit available in an emergency you could avoid having to pay higher interest rates and you may not have to find other avenues of credit Katherine Salisbury cofounder of Qapital a popular finance app told CNBC last year. Lower and middleincome consumers should be especially wary Goodarzi said that consumers with credit scores between 600 and 659 are carrying the highest debt balances about 8000 on average. Credit bureau Experian defines a score of 580 to 669 as fair and most Americans fall somewhere between 600 and 750. This follows the trend that middleclass families are being pinched the most he said. Its the financial throughline of the pandemic inflation has been hurting everyone but the countrys wealthiest and on the eve of a possible recession its lower and middleincome people who should be most cautious about the debt theyre accruing. Lowerincome consumers have largely depleted their excess savings and are now relying more on credit cards Goodarzi said adding that they have begun to dial back on spending and its clear that inflation is impacting them the most.

76,NFL’s Sunday Ticket package heading to YouTube next year in $2bn-per-year deal,<ul><li>YouTube nabs rights to distribute out-of-market games in US</li><li>CNBC reports deal is worth $2bn annually over seven years</li></ul>Fans will have to Google it beginning next season if they want to access the NFL’s Sunday Ticket package.The NFL ann…,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/22/nfl-sunday-ticket-google-youtube-2023-season,Fans will have to Google it beginning next season if they want to access the NFLs Sunday Ticket package. The NFL announced a multiyear agreement on Thursday for Google to distribute the package of outofmarket Sunday afternoon games in the United States on YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime Channels. The NFL was seeking 2. 5bn per season for the package which has been on DirecTV since 1994. The satellite provider has paid 1. 5bn per year on an eightyear contract that expires at the end of this season. CNBC reported the Sunday Ticket deal is for roughly 2bn annually over the course of seven years. Commissioner Roger Goodell said during an interview with CNBC over the summer that the next move for Sunday Ticket would be to a streaming service because that would be the best option for fans. Goodell reiterated that with Thursdays announcement. For a number of years we have been focused on increased digital distribution of our games and this partnership is yet another example of us looking towards the future and building the next generation of NFL fans he said in a statement. It is the second time in less than two years that the NFL has partnered with a streaming service to air games. The leagues 11year contract with Amazon Prime Video for Thursday night games started this season. Besides Amazon Apple and ESPN also expressed interest in NFL Sunday Ticket. As the ways fans enjoy NFL football evolve in a changing media landscape partnerships with innovators like YouTube will ensure that more games are available to more fans said New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft who is also chairman of the NFLs media committee. This partnership will grow our game for future generations and allow them to follow their favorite sport. The NFL has had a presence on YouTube since 2015 when it launched its official NFL channel. That has increased to include channels for all 32 teams and 10 official league channels including NFL Films NFL Network and Mundo NFL. NFL Network and NFL RedZone have been available to subscribers of YouTube TV since 2020. Through this expanded partnership with the NFL viewers will now also be able to experience the game they love in compelling and innovative ways through YouTube TV or YouTube Primetime Channels YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said in a statement. Were excited to continue our work with the NFL to make YouTube a great place for sports lovers everywhere. Starting next season NFL Sunday Ticket will be available as an addon package on YouTube TV and standalone a la carte on YouTube Primetime Channels. UK viewers will still be able to watch live local and primetime games through the Game Pass International service. Google said in June that YouTube TV which was launched in 2017 had surpassed 5m accounts and was the biggest internetbased pay TV service in the US. That number includes users on free promotional trials. YouTube Primetime Channels which launched in November is a service that allows users to subscribe and watch content from streaming services on the YouTube app. Even with Sunday Ticket moving to YouTube the price is not expected to substantially decrease due to contracts with CBS and Fox which carry the Sunday afternoon games. Viewers pay around 300400 a season for the package which averages 2m subscribers. The league also said it would work with YouTube to determine additional ways to support distribution of Sunday Ticket in commercial establishments. Earlier this year Amazon reached an agreement with DirecTV to make sure Thursday night games were available in bars and restaurants.,2022-12-22T15:42:20Z,"Save, don't spend, warns Intuit's CEO, as he notices 'good behavior' around money habits eroding",Extremely Negative,470,"recession, debt, limit, recession, debt, debt, falling, worst, debt, erode, worried, decline, fall, debt, recession, emergency, wary, debt, fall, hurting, recession, debt, falls",Communist,"Sasan, Goodarzi, Goodarzi, Christopher, Rupkey, Goodarzi, Katherine, Salisbury, Goodarzi, Goodarzi, Jack, Ma",businessinsider
77,"Drivers could see gas prices surge to nearly $7 a gallon in some US states as refinery issues bite supply and Chinese demand bounces back, GasBuddy says","""2023 is not going to be a cakewalk for motorists. It could be expensive,"" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/us-gas-prices-7-gallon-2023-oil-markets-gasbuddy-2022-12,Gas prices could surge toward 7 a gallon in some US states in 2023 according to GasBuddy. Cold snaps across the US and revived energy demand from China are the two key factors that could push up prices. 2023 is not going to be a cakewalk for motorists. It could be expensive said Patrick De Haan in a blogpost. Brace for a spike in US gas prices next year due to refinery disruptions and amid renewed energy demand from China as the Asian nation reopens its economy according to GasBuddy. 2023 is not going to be a cakewalk for motorists. It could be expensive said Patrick De Haan head of petroleum analysis at the firm which tracks fuel costs in its 2023 fuel outlook. The national average price of gas at the pump could top around 4 a gallon in most major US cities as early as May next year De Haan said from 3. 18 on Friday. Cities in the West Coast state of California such as San Francisco and Los Angeles could see gas prices approach nearly 7 a gallon in the summer of 2023 according to GasBuddy. Basically curveballs are coming from every direction De Haan said. I dont think weve ever seen such an amount of volatility as we saw this year and that will be a trend that likely continues to lead to wider uncertainty over fuel prices going into 2023 he added. US gas costs have retreated from the highs reached in June when the national average topped 5 a gallon as global oil prices surged amid disruptions created by Russias war with Ukraine and an energy crisis in Europe. The drop came after President Joe Biden started releasing record amounts of crude from US reserves to rein in energy costs and inflation. According to De Haan a rebound in gas prices is already starting in part due to the extreme cold weather conditions blanketing the US which has caused havoc on refineries and curbed the production of gasoline and diesel. That means 2022 will close with a yearly national average for gasoline of 3. 95 a gallon the highest yearly average recorded De Haan tweeted. Chinas reopening is a wildcard to watch in coming daysweeks De Haan warned in a tweet. The window may be closing on those ultralow prices that weve seen over the last couple of weeks. As China has reopened oil prices have rebounded he said in a Friday interview on CNBC. On the whole however GasBuddy noted that drivers are estimated to spend 10 less on gasoline next year compared with 2022 given that the average household is likely to spend 277 less on fuel. What we saw in 2022 was simply madness at the nations fuel pumps with records being set seemingly left and right as Covid imbalances persisted and Russia invaded Ukraine De Haan said in GasBuddys 2023 outlook report. While its highly improbable that lightning strikes the same spot twice the storm clouds over oil and refined markets may persist and there still could be some spikes as the market remains somewhat tight.,2022-12-31T10:00:00Z,NFL’s Sunday Ticket package heading to YouTube next year in $2bn-per-year deal,Extremely Positive,270,-,"Primetime, Primetime, Primetime, primetime, Primetime","Roger, Goodell, Goodell, Robert, Kraft, Susan, Wojcicki, lawsuit",businessinsider
78,How managers can help make their workers happier in 2023,Surveys have found workers want leaders who create positive workplace cultures and a sense of purpose on the job. Bosses can help by showing empathy.,https://www.businessinsider.com/how-managers-can-make-workers-happier-in-2023-2023-1,How managers can help make their workers happier in 2023 In surveys many workers have said theyre unhappy with their job culture. Many people want leaders who cultivate strong workplace cultures and provide a sense of purpose. The average American worker is tired unfocused and disengaged. Theres a good chance shes quiet quitting too. Thats according to two surveys from Gallup a September poll of about 15000 workers and a December canvass of more than 10000 workers on their attitudes toward work. Some of this is a reaction to the pandemic and how it forced people to prioritize their wellbeing. Its also because some workers are feeling more empowered to speak up about their misgivings. But theres something deeper going on as well. Many workers dont think their leaders are creating positive workplace cultures or giving them a sense of purpose. This matters for companies in part because more engaged workers are linked to things businesses want things like productivity and profitability. CEOs who address worker engagement by making them feel valued not only help limit quiet quitting and actual quitting but also see greater returns according to multiple reports from leadership consultancies. They also help their workers overall wellbeing. Employees who feel supported by their bosses are also more likely to feel happier and less likely to have chronic health conditions. People are tired Jasmine Hill the CEO of Radiant Slate Consulting told Insider in September. CEOs need to invest more time energy and resources into developing their culture into developing their employees. To support your workers mental health make work about more than work Workers dont want to feel like theyre just making a paycheck Chris Howard the chief of research at the management consultancy Gartner wrote in a January blog post. They want to feel valued. People want purpose in their lives and that includes work Howard wrote. The more an employer limits those things the higher the employees intent to leave. Gallups research found that employees who said their companies provided them with a sense of purpose and made them feel a part of something bigger were over seven times as likely to say that their job had an extremely positive influence on their mental health than those who didnt. The takeaway for managers is clear Connect each employees work to the companys larger purpose. Empathy also plays a big role in making workers feel more engaged at work. Leaders dont have to be experts in mental health in order to demonstrate they care and are paying attention Tracy Brower a sociologist and author on happiness wrote in Forbes. Its enough to check in ask questions and take cues from the employee about how much they want to share. Barbara Corcoran the founder of the Corcoran Group and an investor on the TV series Shark Tank told CNBC the most powerful way to build relationships with workers was to listen to them. Opening your ear to employees to find out whats going right and wrong is smart business Corcoran said. You avoid many plane crashes by regularly asking people Hows it going before really listening to their answer. Businessleadership researchers at McKinsey Co. said in a 2021 report that more managers needed to prioritize mental health. As a leader the best thing you can do to encourage employees to consider their own mental wellbeing is to start the conversation of mental health yourself Michelle Tenzyk the CEO of East Tenth Group a business consultancy said. Leaders and their team should be encouraged to take mentalhealth days when needed use up their vacation time and set strict working hours to avoid endless days of overtime Tenzyk said.
