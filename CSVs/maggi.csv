1,Go Big With Banh Mi in Ho Chi Minh City,"In HCMC, banh mi, the classic Vietnamese sandwich, comes loaded with lots of extra cold cuts, cooked meats, pickles, and sauces.",https://www.eater.com/23500270/banh-mi-ho-chi-minh-city-vietnam-saigon,If youve eaten banh mi Vietnams famous sandwich outside of its homeland its fair to say that you already have a rough idea of what to expect in Ho Chi Minh City. Most of the worlds Vietnamese emigrants hail from the countrys south including the city formerly known as Saigon and they have carried their culinary traditions and sensibilities with them. In terms of banh mi this means put bluntly massive sandwiches filled with lots of stuff. But its not all about excess. In an ideal HCMCstyle banh mi the copious meats herbs and condiments even seemingly lackluster bread come together as a cohesive entity one that is greater than the sum of its admittedly many parts in what is undoubtedly one of the greatest sandwiches in the world. What is a Ho Chi Minh Citystyle banh mi Wheatbased ovenbaked bread was introduced by the French who had been visiting Vietnam since the 17th century long before they colonized the area in the 19th century. But according to Andrea Nguyen author of The Banh Mi Handbook the term banh mi didnt appear until 1945. The style of banh mi that emerged in Hanoi in the countrys north was a minimalist affair that had much more in common with its French roots with bread a bit of protein and one or two seasonings. But when the sandwich arrived in HCMC around 60 years ago the city made banh mi its own. People in HCMC like to live large so the sandwiches tend to be bigger and more loaded up than elsewhere says Nguyen. Today banh mi is arguably more beloved and ubiquitous there than it is elsewhere in Vietnam. HCMCstyle banh mi are typically immense combining as many as eight types of meat and a smear of pate a generous helping of crunchy pickled vegetables a tangle of fresh herbs and lashings of mayonnaise soy sauce black pepper and perhaps even chile sauce all in a crispy shelllike roll baguette isnt really an accurate descriptor anymore bulging like Popeyes arms. In addition to girth a particularly good HCMCstyle banh mi should have equal parts crunch from both the bread and pickled vegetables and meat with the condiments and seasonings providing a pleasant but not overwhelming counter to the proteins. The bread The classic Hanoistyle banh mi bread is chewy heavy closer to a French baguette says Peter Cuong Franklin the Vietnamese American chefowner of Anan and Nhau Nhau in HCMC. But this loaf underwent some significant changes in Ho Chi Minh City. In Saigon its all about speed time and money says Cuong Franklin. Bakers need to get the bread out as soon as possible. This means loaves that are baked with lots of water leavening agents and stabilizers at a very high temperature with little variation among vendors or bakers. The result is the standard HCMCstyle banh mi roll a downright blimplike loaf with three slits that allow maximum expansion while baking a thin crust that shatters when you bite into it and a light airy crumb. And although baking snobs may scoff at banh mi bread former Pok Pok chefowner Andy Ricker who has been obsessed with baking the perfect roll for years now says The ethereal loaf does exactly what it is made for delivering the stuffing without interfering in the flavors offering little more resistance to your bite than a slightly crunchy cloud. The fillings According to Cuong Franklin in the north banh mi was often served at charcuterie shops which focused on very choice select meats leading to relatively minimalist sandwiches. In Ho Chi Minh City its the other way around he says. Instead of charcuterie sellers bringing in bread for sandwiches banh mi are found at bakeries that buy their charcuterie from outside. In place of a small menu of Frenchstyle meats HCMCs vendors serve a massive spread of longlasting quickserve tht ngui Vietnamese cold cuts. A single bnh m tht ngui sometimes shortened to bnh m tht can include pork liver pate ch lagi la steamed sausage made with or without pepper gi th headcheese and an array of other meats. It takes a lot of work to prepare quality Viet charcuterie from pate to headcheese says Nguyen who adds that her ideal banh mi order must include these items. I want to see how good the banh mi maker is. Other popular meats are xu mi pork meatballs served plain in a tomatoey sauce or in a broth with bread on the side tht nng grilled pork patties or skewers and g x chicken floss. You may also see x xu Chinesestyle roasted pork ch bng pork floss c mi sardines ch c deepfried fish cake and b strands of pork skin. If youre overwhelmed by the choices opt for c bit the special which typically means more meat. Im often ordering bnh m c bit in Ho Chi Minh City to get a fully loaded banh mi says Nguyen. Its the works and thats what Im in town for Along with proteins you may find pickled carrot or daikon along with fresh vegetables like cucumber onion chile green onions andor cilantro. Often overlooked in the banh mi canon are the sandwiches that revolve around eggs. It doesnt get much simpler than bnh m p la a crispy puffy Ho Chi Minh City roll served with a couple of fried eggs inevitably drizzled with Maggi and supplemented with a few pickles and perhaps a sprig of cilantro. Even better is bnh m cho a deconstructed sandwich of sorts that Nguyen calls the Dennys Grand Slam of banh mi. The meal combines eggs and some kind of protein a slice of peppery steamed sausage a dab of pate or even a hot dog fried in a tiny skillet paired with garnishes and sides that can range from mayonnaise to pickled vegetables with bread on the side. Where to eat banh mi in Ho Chi Minh City In Ho Chi Minh City banh mi is almost always sold to go. Banh mi is like energy bars You can hold it walk around take it back to the office Cuong Franklin says. With the exception of places that sell bnh m cho the deconstructed egg banh mi youre not typically going to find seating. Bnh M Hunh Hoa Bnh M Hunh Hoa arguably the citys most famous banh mi vendor is all about excess. The standard sandwich here is positively massive stacked with six types of Vietnamesestyle cold cuts as well as pate chicken floss and the usual vegetables herbs and seasonings it also costs about 50 percent more than the average banh mi. Youll inevitably have to queue behind dozens of tourists and motorcycledelivery guys and the sandwiches are togo only but its worth the wait for a banh mi that functions as an entire meal. 26 L Th Ring District 1 Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam Bnh M Cho There are more famous vendors of bnh m cho the deconstructed egg banh mi but this alleyside stall in District 1 is a convenient and cheery place to try this unique dish. Order the everything version and youll get a tiny skillet with two fried eggs a meatball and a dab of pate. Mayo pickled vegetables and bread arrive on the side and dont forget to season your spread with a few drops of Maggi sauce a constant companion to egg dishes in Southeast Asia. 6 ng Trn Cn District 1 Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam A Tng Concealed in a sleepy courtyard just off a busy road in central Ho Chi Minh City this vendor does one of the most unique versions in town. Known as bnh m b nng b Campuchia Cambodianstyle grilled beef banh mi the sandwich features chubby toasted rolls slathered with a honey butterlike condiment and paired with slim skewers of spiced grilled beef and crunchy strands of green papaya. Make your own sandwich or dip into the elements separately if youre a fan of sweet flavors its a lot of fun. 171 Cng Qunh District 1 Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam Bnh M Hng Hoa Hng Hoa offers one of the citys better allaround banh mis. The bnh m tht ngui called extra mixed meats on the handy Englishlanguage menu has a bit of everything a schmear of peppery pate crunchy barely sweet papaya pickles Chinesestyle roasted pork Vietnamesestyle steamed sausage salty chicken threads and more. On the opposite end of the banh mi spectrum the bnh m p la with fried egg is minimal and delicious. The place mostly sells items to go but there are a few plastic chairs. Hng Hoa doubles as a bakery so the bread is always fresh. 54 Nguyn Vn Trng District 1 Ho Chi Minh City Nhau Nhau Cuong Franklin has become famous for his 100 foie gras and caviar banh mi at Anan but for something more accessible head upstairs to Nhau Nhau where you can indulge in one of the chefs mini banh mi for less than a tenth of that price. Served on smaller chewier Hanoistyle baguettes that Cuong Franklin commissions especially for the restaurant the wagyu version is impossibly tender while the foie gras is uncompromisingly rich. 89 Tn Tht m District 1 Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam Qun Bnh M Heo Quay Phc Hi A clever twist on the traditional banh mi this version revolves around Chinesestyle roasted pork belly. A small amount of crispy fatty heo quay as its known in Vietnamese is chopped drizzled with a chilestudded brown sauce and a splash of soy and topped with slices of cucumber and lots of cilantro. For HCMC its relatively light and simple and its utterly delicious.

2,Brazil Prosecutors Eye Bolsonaro’s Assets as Rich Backers Disavow Riots,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazilian prosecutors asked a court to seize the assets of former President Jair Bolsonaro as their investigation of the violent, anti...",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brazil-prosecutors-eye-bolsonaro-assets-173057969.html,Brazil Prosecutors Eye Bolsonaros Assets as Rich Backers Disavow Riots Bloomberg Brazilian prosecutors asked a court to seize the assets of former President Jair Bolsonaro as their investigation of the violent antigovernment riots that shook the country Sunday expands beyond the demonstrators themselves. Most Read from Bloomberg US Safety Agency to Consider Ban on Gas Stoves Amid Health Fears Rental Housing Is Suddenly Headed Toward a Hard Landing Brady Gisele Patriots Bob Kraft Among FTX Shareholders Facing Wipeout Microsoft Considers 10 Billion Investment in ChatGPT Creator Stocks Bounce Back With Brewing Optimism Over CPI Markets Wrap Officials said the money should be used to help pay for the damage to public property when protesters stormed government buildings in Brasilia on Jan. 8. Separately investigators have also identified more than 100 companies suspected of having financed the rioters and will call for their assets to be blocked CNN Brasil reported without saying where it got the information. Officials are broadening their investigation into Brazils worst political violence in decades after arresting more than 1500 rioters with a focus on tracking down who paid to ferry the Bolsonaro supporters to Brasilia and who funded protest camps in front of military headquarters. Authorities are also looking into possible ties between the protesters and some members of Brazils massive agricultural sector a key financial backer of Bolsonaro but Justice Minister Flavio Dino said its too early to say who bankrolled the riots. Prosecutors wont stop at the people arrested on site Dino told GloboNews on Tuesday. We will escalate this investigation as much as possible to the upper echelons that directed the terrorism in Brazil. Latin Americas largest economy is reeling from the aftermath of the efforts by backers of Bolsonaro to restore him to power which included trashing government offices breaking windows and destroying artwork. Much like the rioters who broke into the US Capitol in 2021 in support of Donald Trump the former presidents allies are convinced voter fraud kept him from winning reelection in the October vote he lost to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Brazils Lula Says Rioters Will Fail in Coup Attempt Some of the biggest financial supporters of Bolsonaros 2022 campaign disavowed Sundays violence including agribusiness magnate Hugo de Carvalho Ribeiro attorney and preacher Fabiano Zettel and Luciano Hang the billionaire owner of department store chain Havan. Bolsonaro a populist former army captain who stunned political analysts when he won the presidency in 2018 relied on a network of individual donors both bigticketed and small to try to hold on to his job last year. A majority of his campaigns financial support came from the powerful agriculture sector. Brazil is the worlds biggest exporter of soybeans beef coffee and sugar and the industry accounts for about 25 of gross domestic product. After narrowly losing to Lula Bolsonaro retreated to the presidential palace and then holed in Florida as his successor took over. But opponents say his comments in interviews and tweets encouraged thinking among some of his backers that they could overturn his electoral defeat ultimately leading to the riots. Bolsonaro himself condemned the protests on Sunday. After being admitted to a hospital near Orlando with abdominal pain on Monday he told CNN Brasil he expects to cut his US trip short and head back to Brazil. Brazil Rioters Destroyed Priceless Artwork in Capital Rampage Zettel a partner at a Sao Paulobased law firm focused on the finance sector and the biggest single donor to Bolsonaros 2022 campaign sought to distance himself from the riots. The ballot results must be honored democracy defended by us all he said in an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. Hang also criticized Jan. 8s violence. I never backed or would back acts of violence and vandalism he said in an emailed response to questions. I didnt donate to participate in or foster any antidemocratic act nor act against public property. I repudiate everything that was done on Sunday. Ribeiro a member of the sprawling Maggi family one of the biggest landowners in Brazil was the thirdbiggest donor to Bolsonaros presidential campaign last year. He said that rioters should be identified and punished in an emailed statement. Ribeiro is a shareholder at Amaggi a commodities conglomerate that had over 7. 3 billion in revenue in 2021. Farmers in Brazil much like those in the US tend to tilt conservative and align with Bolsonaros avowed religious faith and family values. They also appreciated his willingness to champion their priorities over environmental concerns especially in the Amazon. Brazilian farmers have pushed back on the idea they had any responsibility for the riots in Brasilia. Remarks that suggest otherwise are inappropriate and dont reflect the real importance of agribusiness for the country a group of soybean producers in Mato Grosso state said Monday. For now as authorities try to find those responsible for funding the riots theyre also still trying to track down the people who actually broke into the government buildings. As in the US after Jan. 6 2021 Brazilian authorities are pouring over selfies and social media posts to identify and arrest more participants. The Justice Ministry has set up an email address where people can rat out protesters and has already received over 30000 tips. With assistance from Bruna Lessa and Rachel Gamarski.
