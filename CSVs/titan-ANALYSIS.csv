The shares have been hit by pandemic disruptions management issues and the wider market downturn. The media giants shares are trading close to an eightyear low. Disney stock has plunged 45 this year leaving it poised to deliver its worst annual performance in nearly five decades as a profusion of challenges continues to bedevil the media giant. Shares of Disney closed almost 5 lower Monday after the longawaited Avatar The Way of Water had a disappointing opening weekend in movie theaters. They rallied as much as 2 on Tuesday. The stock is now trading at 2014 levels on a splitadjusted basis and remains on track for its largest yearly decline since 1974 according to CNBC. The painful selloff has erased about 200 billion from Disneys market capitalization since March 2021. Disneys business stretches from blockbuster movies to TV shows cable channels theme parks resorts cruises retail stores video games and streaming entertainment. Unsurprisingly it was hit hard by the travel restrictions production disruptions and closures of cinemas stores and entertainment venues seen during the COVID19 pandemic. While most of its operations have now reopened they havent fully recovered yet. One bright spot has been Disney Plus which has grown its paid subscribers from about 27 million at the end of 2019 to 164 million as of October 1. Yet investors have balked at the streaming services rising costs which fueled a hefty 1. 5 billion operating loss in Disneys streaming division last quarter. Disney stock has also been caught up in a wider market downturn. Inflation has surged to 40year highs this year spurring the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates from virtually zero in March to over 4 today in a bid to slow the pace of price increases. However rising prices and borrowing costs are squeezing consumers and businesses. Theyre also dragging down asset prices and fanning fears of a recession and slump in company earnings next year. The entertainment titan weathered some bad publicity during Bob Chapeks tenure as CEO. However Bob Iger who masterminded Disneys acquisitions of Marvel Pixar and Lucasfilm took back the companys reins in November sparking an uplift in its stock price and revitalizing investors hopes of a turnaround.

For most people that would be when you either try to flee or become a helpless victim but for office worker Akira Tendo this is just the right time to get out of his dead end office job. Instead of fretting over bills and hating himself for not having the courage to ask out his coworker Akira decides to say YOLO and accomplish all 100 items on his bucket list before he inevitably becomes zombie chow or a casualty of the militarys efforts against the horde. Zom 100 is based on a manga of the same name by Haro Aso Alice in Borderland and Kotaro Takata.

4,MSI might have the ultimate mini-LED laptop display at CES 2023,"MSI showed off its next-gen GT77 Titan before CES 2023, which is fitted with a 4K mini-LED display that's certified for DisplayHDR 1000.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/msi-titan-gt77-mini-led-4k-display-ces-2023/,MSI is taking laptop displays to a new level at CES 2023 and it might have the sector cornered for a while. Ahead of CES MSI announced the updated Titan GT77 HX which comes with the first miniLED 4K 144Hz display in a laptop and it boasts some insane specs. If a 4K miniLED laptop display at 144Hz isnt enough the screen also comes with VESAs DisplayHDR 1000 certification. That means it can reach 1000 nits of peak brightness. MSI also says it comes with a 10000001 contrast ratio which is on the level of screens like the Alienware 34 QDOLED and in a laptop at that. MSI says it has an exclusive partnership with AUO and its AmLED display tech which means the Titan GT77 HX might be the only laptop with this display for a while. Its possible well see more laptops with it soon but MSI seems content that the Titan GT77 will be the first laptop with this screen. The exclusive AmLED Adaptive Control Technology is what allows the GT77 Titan to reach such impressive specs. This is a form of local dimming that allows the display to dynamically adjust to images onscreen in real time. In total the GT77 Titan includes 1008 local dimming zones which is close to highend monitors like the Samsung Odyssey Neo G8. HDR performance could be off the charts but MSI didnt forget about color. The company says the laptop covers 100 of the DCIP3 color space and its verified by MSIs True Color certification. That means its examined before assembly to ensure color accuracy. Although we dont have concrete specs yet we expect the Titan GT77 should have topend chips from Intel and Nvidia read last years MSI GT77 Titan review for context. We also expect MSI OverBoost which supplies the GPU and CPU with up to 250 watts of power as well as a multiplexer MUX switch on board allowing you to swap to only discrete graphics for full power or only to integrated graphics for increased battery life. Just like last years model we also anticipate the same mechanical keyboard that MSI codeveloped with Cherry as well as MSIs Mystic Light bar at the back of the machine which you can control with SteelSeries GG software along with the keyboard.

About 8 staff were also laid off in Goldmans research department in Hong Kong the source added with layoffs ongoing in the investment bank and other divisions. Goldmans redundancy plans will be followed by a broader spending review taking in corporate travel and expenses the Financial Times reported on Wednesday as it counts the costs of a massive slowdown in corporate dealmaking and a slump in capital markets activity since the war in Ukraine. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Goldman had 49100 employees at the end of the third quarter after adding significant numbers of staff during the coronavirus pandemic. The lender is also slashing its annual bonus payments this year to reflect the depressed market conditions with payouts expected to fall about 40.

Were grateful for all our peoples contributions and were providing support to ease their transitions. Our focus now is to appropriately size the firm for the opportunities ahead of us in a challenging macroeconomic environment. The cuts are part of broader reductions across the banking industry as a possible global recession looms. At least 5000 people are in the process of being cut from various banks.

8,'Major Milestone': NASA's Webb Telescope Finds Its First Exoplanet - CNET,The world isn't too far off and nearly the exact same size as Earth.,https://www.cnet.com/science/space/major-milestone-nasa-webb-telescope-finds-its-first-exoplanet/,The James Webb Telescope has been operating for less than a year but Wednesday brought news of the first exoplanet to be confirmed using the nextgeneration space observatory from NASA and the European Space Agency. The rocky Earthlike world named LHS 475 b has almost exactly the same diameter as our planet and is located just 41 lightyears away which is very close on a cosmic scale. The team used Webb to observe the system around red dwarf star LHS 475 after data from NASAs Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite TESS hinted there may be a planet circling the small sun. There is no question that the planet is there. Webbs pristine data validate it Jacob LustigYaeger from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory who helped lead the research said in a statement. With this telescope rocky exoplanets are the new frontier. Theres been lots of excitement among astronomers over Webbs potential for taking a closer look at exoplanets to analyze the composition of their atmospheres which may hint at the potential for habitability and even signs of life. In the case of LHS 475 b however the scientists say they need more data to be able to draw any conclusions on that front. Hubble and James Webb Space Telescope Images Compared See the DifferenceSee all photos There are some terrestrialtype atmospheres that we can rule out LustigYaeger explained. It cant have a thick methanedominated atmosphere similar to that of Saturns moon Titan. Scenarios that havent been ruled out however include a world with no atmosphere or one thats 100 carbon dioxide and either of those options clearly isnt good for the prospect of life as we know it. There are some other pretty serious strikes against the potential habitability of LHS 475 b. While its star isnt nearly as hot as our sun for instance the planet orbits so close in that it completes an orbit in just two days and has temperatures that are likely a few hundred degrees hotter than Earth. Nonetheless the find represents a major milestone for Webb according to team coleader Kevin Stevenson.

The deal was targeted to close by the end of 2022 but it isnt clear if it has been finalized yet Semafor reported citing documents sent to prospective investors. The Wall Street Journal reported last Thursday that OpenAI was in talks to sell existing shares of the company in a tender offer that would value the firm at 29 billion. Venture capital firms including Thrive Capital and Founders Funds were in talks to invest at least 300 million in the share sales according to the Journal. As part of the current deal Microsoft is negotiating its proposing to get 75 of OpenAIs profits until it gets it recovers its investment after which Microsofts aims to get 49 stake in the company per the media outlet. Other investors are expected to own another 49 of the company while OpenAIs nonprofit parent would hold the remaining stake per Semafor. Microsoft told Insider it does not comment on speculation. OpenAI did not immediately respond to Insiders request for comment sent outside regular business hours. This would not be the first time Microsofts looking at an investment into OpenAI. The tech titan has already invested 1 billion into OpenAI in 2019. The Information reported in October that Microsoft was looking to increase its investment in the startup.

10,How Big Is The Moon? - Worldatlas.com,"Earth’s moon is the fifth largest moon in the solar system with a diameter of 2,159-miles (3,475-kilometers), making it about 25% the size of Earth.",https://www.worldatlas.com/space/how-big-is-the-moon.html,The moon has a radius of 1080miles 1737kilometers. This means that the moons diameter is 2159miles 3475kilometers across. For comparison the diameter of Earth is 7918miles 12742kilometers. This shows that the moon is approximately a quarter the width of Earth. The moons size impacts specific processes on Earth the most notable of which is the tides. The moons gravitational pull causes the oceans to bulge on either side. As the planet rotates these bulges also rotate causing the rise and fall of seawater. Gravitational force is dictated by the size and distance of objects so if the moon were the size of Marss moons Phobos and Deimos it would not have as strong of a gravitational pull and thus would not affect the tides. Compared To Other Objects in the Solar System It can be hard to visualize just how big celestial bodies are and the moon is no exception. Earths moon is fairly big in comparison to other moons in the solar system but what exactly does that mean The moon orbiting Earth is the fifth largest moon in the solar system. Moons larger than ours include in decreasing order Ganymede Titan Callisto and Io. Even though Earths moon is not the biggest in the solar system it is the largest when compared to the planet it orbits. The moon is also quite a bit bigger than the dwarf planet Pluto which has a radius of 1477miles 2377kilometers. This makes Pluto around 70 the size of Earths moon. Compared to countries on Earth It still might be hard to visualize just how large the moon is when only comparing it to other celestial objects. Comparing the size of our moon to countries and continents on Earth might show more context into its sheer size. The United States of America has a diameter of 2897miles 4662kilometers making it almost the same width as the moon. However having the diameter of the moon only paints a part of the picture. To compare the moons size to the size of countries on Earth the surface area is required. The moons surface area is 14. 6million square miles 38million square kilometers. When compared again to the United States of America the moon has approximately four times as much surface area. This is smaller than the continent of Asia including Russia which boasts a surface area of 17. 2million square miles 44. 6 million square kilometers.,Microsoft is reportedly in talks to pump in $10 billion into OpenAI — the owner of ChatGPT — valuing the company at $29 billion,Extremely Negative,210,"['rival', 'falls']",[],"[Liz, Hoffman, Reed, Albergotti, Sam, Altman, Elon, Musk, Sam, Altman, sama, Beatrice, Nolan, Jack, Ma]"

13,What is the Titan M2 security chip in Google’s Pixel phones?,Google's Titan M2 is a dedicated security co-processor made specifically for Pixel smartphones. Here's everything you need to know.,https://www.androidauthority.com/titan-m2-google-3261547/,Links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. What is the Titan M2 security chip in Googles Pixel phones With the Pixel 6 series Google began developing its inhouse Tensor SoC. But that wasnt the first time the search giant used a piece of custom silicon in its smartphones the Pixel 2s Pixel Visual Core was technically the first. One generation later the company announced that Pixel 3 devices would include a hardware security module dubbed Titan M. Then in 2021 Google followed it up with the Titan M2. The security chip has since become a selling point for Google phones like the Pixel 7 series and Pixel 6a. So in this article lets take a closer look at the role of the Titan M2 in Pixel devices how it works and why its even necessary in the first place. What is the Titan M2 chip all about The Titan M2 is a dedicated security chip included in Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 series smartphones. Google designed the Titan M2 inhouse so that it could exercise complete control over its feature set. The chip is based on the RISCV CPU architecture and contains its own memory RAM and cryptographic accelerator. The Titan M2 is one of the many measures Google has employed to improve smartphone security over the years. The company uses the chip in its Pixel phones to provide an additional layer of protection on top of Androids default security measures. Google designed the Titan M2 chip to augment Androids default security measures. Take Androids mandatory fulldisk encryption. On most devices it relies on a security feature known as a Trusted Execution Environment TEE which is essentially the secure area of a processor. Android devices store their encryption keys within this secure area which is in turn guarded with your pattern PIN or passcode. In other words the TEE isolates cryptographic keys and never reveals them to the user or even the operating system. Related Everything you need to know about encryption Virtually all smartphone SoCs in this day and age have a TEE or similar secure environment. On Snapdragon chips its commonly referred to as the Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment QSEE. Apples Armbased chips like the M1 have the Secure Enclave. With these secure environments in place malicious apps cannot access decryption keys biometrics and other sensitive data. With the Pixel 3 Google decoupled the TEE from the chipset and used a separate security module instead. The Titan M which has now been replaced by the Titan M2 can almost be considered a standalone processor by itself. The chip has its own flash memory for storing sensitive data and runs its own minimal operating system sometimes called a microkernel. The Titan M2 is a separate chip that doesnt share resources like memory or cache with the main processor. Its worth noting that dedicated security chips arent a new concept. Many computer motherboards have a Trusted Platform Module TPM chip that serves the same purpose albeit with less flexibility. What does the Titan M2 chip do Unlike the main SoC that performs generalpurpose tasks a dedicated security chip like the Titan M2 executes very few functions. This vastly reduces the number of potential attack vectors since most software cannot directly interact with the security chip. As for what the security chip actually does lets start with booting the Android operating system. When you turn on a Pixel device the Titan M2 communicates with the bootloader to validate that youre running the latest known version of Android. This check ensures an attacker hasnt rolled back your devices operating system to an older potentially unsafe version. Google also states that the chip safeguards against malicious attempts to unlock the bootloader. The Titan M2 comes into play as soon as you press the power button quite literally. Once booted the phones storage remains encrypted and inaccessible until you clear the lock screen prompt. The Titan M2 plays a key role here as it stores the decryption keys. Even if an attacker tampers the operating system to try and bruteforce their way through the lock screen the chip will limit the number of attempts at the hardware level. Titan M2 will only reveal the decryption keys if you enter the correct pattern or PIN. But what if an attacker tries to tamper with the Titan M2 directly Google thought of that too. You cant change or update the chips firmware without the devices pattern or PIN. The company also says it hardened the chip against sidechannel attacks like power analysis and voltage fluctuations. The Titan M2 also supports Android StrongBox which is a safe storage space for cryptographic keys used by thirdparty apps. A payment app for example could request the chip to generate and store a private key for your saved cards. And with Androids Protected Confirmation the chip also supports the universal FIDO authentication standard. This means you can use Pixel phones as a physical twofactor authentication key for your online accounts. In terms of security Google treats it as on par with the 30 Titan Security Key. The Titan M2 hasnt revolutionized smartphone security by any means but it does eliminate some key potential attack vectors. Google is currently the only smartphone maker to use a dedicated security module. However that doesnt mean other Android devices arent secure enough. The Arm chips used in modern smartphones also have isolated and secure environments just not to the same degree as the Titan M2.

14,Secretlab Omega 2020 vs Titan Evo 2022: The battle of the ultimate gaming chairs,"The Titan is the newest, while the Omega is the least expensive. Which one will come out on top?",https://www.imore.com/gaming/gaming-chairs/secretlab-omega-2020-vs-titan-evo-2022-the-battle-of-the-ultimate-gaming-chairs,Secretlab Omega 2020 vs Titan Evo 2022 The battle of the ultimate gaming chairs The Titan Vs the Omega which is the best gaming chair from Secretlab Still excellent The Secretlab Omega may be a couple of years old now but it is still a phenomenal chair for most people. Its bucketed like a race car and the cushions in the box are brilliant. Its not great for larger people but everyone else is going to love it. For Looks incredible Comfortable bucketing The best neck and lumbar pillows in the business Against Not great for taller or larger people Still quite expensive The big and beautiful The latest chair from Secretlab and potentially its best. Its big comfortable and quite expensive. The chair is well worth the price tag making short work of its competition. The gaming chair for everyone who can afford it. For Very comfortable and supportive Lots of different colors and materials Godtier magnetic pillow Against Expensive Expensive accessory addons. The Secretlab Titan Evo 2022 is one of iMores most highlyrated chairs. Its big comfy and extremely wellbuilt. Its the newest chair in the Secretlab line avaialble in an incredible number of colors and materials. Its also not cheap. The Titan Evo starts at 439 and then goes up to 1099 for the topoftheline Napa Leather option making it one of the more expensive gaming chairs on the market. Its also available in three size options. There are small and regular size options that both cost the same and then an XL option that costs 50 more than the smaller ones. The version here is the XL. While you definitely get what you pay for is it possible to get a similar experience with one of Secretlabs older chairs The Secretlab Omega 2020 is still a fantastic chair. In my review I scored it four and a half stars the only real shortcoming being that its not quite for my body shape or others like me. Otherwise materials patterns and build quality are also excellent and you can grab one from 389 up to 459 for addons and premium materials. Because its one of Secretlabs older models its reduced in effectively a permanent sale. Thats a fair amount less than the newer Titan Evo but is the upgrade worth the extra or should you stick with the older model Weve put them head to head to find out whether you can save some money on the old one and get a similar experience or whether you should spend the extra dollars. Titan Evo 2022 VS Omega 2020 Build and materials Why you can trust iMore Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. The Titan Evo is made out of some of the best materials around. The fabric used on the surface of the chair has to be touched to be believed. Its soft and textured with some lovely give to it. It also feels strong as if it could take some punishment. The PU leather is also impressive feeling as close to real leather as I think its possible for fake leather. Theres oodles of metal all over the place. The metal wheelbase in particular is very impressive spreading out large enough to not fit easily through most doorways in my house. The chair feels like a tank. A big comfy tank. Its certainly built like one for the most part. The only thing that feels a little funky on the chair is the 4D armrests. Its cool that they can pan around in all different directions but theres a wobble present that takes some of the luster away from what is otherwise a spectacularly wellmade chair. Its an issue thats not present on the Omega 2020. While there is a little give in the armrests they otherwise feel phenomenally stable. The rest of the Omega 2020 is similar to the Titan Evo 2022. The materials are again fantastic the PU again feeling uncannily like real leather and the metal making the chair far too heavy for one person to lift up the stairs. It does fall down in one key area compared to the Titan however. These are both chairs with phenomenal levels of tilt. The back falls back far enough to let you stare at the ceiling and the seat base tilts even more effectively letting you lay down flat. Its an impressive feat and one that feels better on the Titan Evo. The Titan Evo feels more strength in the tilt mechanism. The Omega while sturdy has more give to its tilt mechanisms and it can feel a little scary going backward. While the armrests are a little rattly the sturdiness of the tilt mechanism on the Titan means it wins out this round. Winner Titan Evo 2022 Titan Evo 2022 VS Omega 2020 Ease of use While there are loads of levers and nobs on the Titan Evo they are all easy to learn and even easier to use. They all feel sturdy and are within easy reach even on my enormous Titan Evo XL. Theres a lever that unlocks the tilt function under the left side of the chair a lever that controls the height of the chair under the right side and a handle that tilts the backrest on the right side. The two levers on the underside are both plastic but have a pleasing feel to them and the action is positive and easy to click into place. The lever for the backrest has a lovely almost carlike handle on it making swinging the backrest back super easy and convenient. There are then two wheels on the backrest itself. These control the adjustable lumbar on the backrest and both feel excellent to use. Theres one on either side with one controlling the height of the support and the other controlling the depth. The armrests also feature loads of buttons and switches. There are two metal switches that unlock the armrest height adjustment that move with a satisfying clunk. These are on the outside of each armrest and are easy to adjust. Theres then a button under the armrests on the inside of the chair and they control how close the armrests are to you. These again click nicely and the armrests move with a smooth slider. The final buttons are on the end of the armrests and they control the swivel and forwards and backward movement of the rests. These are also metal and feel great to the touch. All these controls may seem overwhelming but you quickly get used to what all of them do. Its as easy to use as any other desk chair with intuitive controls that are all easy to reach. Things are a very similar story in the Omega 2020. The controls to manipulate the tilt and height and the armrest controls are identical all working and feeling as good as the controls on the Titan Evo 2022. It does lack the lumbar adjustment nobs but thats only because it lacks the lumbar adjustment of the bigger chair. Either way the controls on both are equally as sturdy and easy to use so this one is an easy draw. Winner DRAW Titan Evo 2022 VS Omega 2020 Comfort and features The Titan Evo 2022 is to put it simply one of the most comfortable chairs I have ever sat in. The seat base is wide and fairly shallow with plenty of room for my generous frame. The seat cushion has enough give to be comfortable but stiff enough that you dont immediately sink to the hard cushion base of the course of the day. The bucketing on the backrest is excellent and keeps you in place no matter how fast you might spin around on the spinner. The armrests are supportive and while plastic comfortable enough not to notice the hardness of the material. The most comfortable part of the chair is the adjustable Lumbar support on the backrest of the chair. With the nobs mentioned above you can make the support more or less pronounced and you can change the vertical position as well to make sure its in the right place on your back. It can be a little tricky to dial it in but when its there its great. The whole package adds up to be a deskbound throne that keeps you comfy throughout the day. The Omega 2020 is also comfortable but not as comfortable as the Titan Evo 2022. See mileage may vary with this one. The cushion material is similar to that of the Titan but the racecarlike bucketing on the seat digs into my legs as I sit on the chair throughout the day. In this regard the chair isnt as comfortable to me. For those with less posterior girth however things will be a lot more comfortable. The slimmer seat cushion has all the same softness and stiffness benefits as with the new one and that bucketing will do more to keep you in place during long sitting sessions. For me its simply not it. For others it could well be the one. Perhaps its because of the size options that are available on the Titan Evo. My XL is designed to fit taller and larger frames while the Omega is designed for smaller ones. You can of course get the regular and small sizes in the Titan Evo that are closer to the Omega in size but they lack the severe bucketing so to my mind they are likely to be more comfortable. The Omega does lack some of the other comfortable features of the bigger chair. Theres no adjustable lumbar support on the backrest and the armrests are a little harder than those on the Titan. It also doesnt go quite so far up on the back and the head pillow that comes in the box doesnt adjust quite as well as it does on the Titan. Dont get me wrong the Omega is still a super comfortable chair but the Titan just feels a little more so. WINNER Titan Evo 2022 Titan Evo 2022 VS Omega 2020 Look and style If youre looking for something more simple then the Titan is the way to go. It lacks some of the overthetop styling queues of other gaming chairs opting instead to be smoother and less in your face. My version with the SoftWeave fabric looks great and slips perfectly into my workspace. Beyond that however theres not much to comment on. The Omega goes a little further. I simply adore the way this thing looks. Its like a racing seat on a stand replete with bucketing and shaping. Mine also has one of the very cool special designs on in particular the KDA All Out design. It is stunning. Theres glittering thread embroidered into small character logos and KDA on the backrest. Theres more almost fractallooking embroidery on the backrest and seat base as well as shards of holographic PU that shimmers in the light. It looks amazing and feels like itll last too. These designs are available on the Titan Evo but the shape of the chair is still less intricate than the Omega. The Omega is everything all at once and looks great doing it. If you want the comfort of the Titan and the louder design however you can do that. I wish my chair had the design but alas no such luck. Between the two I have to say that the Omega looks better than the Titan. Its a gorgeous chair even without the snazzy design on it but that design just elevates it further. Want something that doesnt shout super loud about itself The Titan Evo is the way to go. Want something that stands out The Omega is the way to go. WINNER OMEGA 2020 Titan Evo 2022 VS Omega 2020 Extras In the Titans box you get a couple of extras. The neck pillow is big and super soft with magnets in the back to make it easy to adjust up and down at the top of the backrest. Secretlabs pillows are always great and this one is absolutely no different. Apart from the little tool kit you get as well however thats pretty much it. While you can swap the covers of the armrests out you dont get any extra ones in the box. You can buy some extras and theyre pretty great. Im currently enjoying the Technogel armrest covers. Theyre a thin layer of gel covered with a PU membrane that are super soft and really makes resting those elbows really comfortable. I am told the PlushCell memory foam armrest covers are also brilliant with the same memory foam and soft fabric youll find in the cushions albeit attached to an armrest cover. You can buy a lumbar cushion from the website as well although its a little thin. Instead I am lucky enough to be able to nab the Lumbar cushion from the Omega. You can buy it online but it comes in the box with the older chair. It is a wonderful cushion. Just the right thickness and covered with a super soft microfibre fabric. Its thin enough that I still get the Lumbar support from the builtin adjustments but thick enough to be really comfortable. In fact for extras you get in the box the Omega wins out. That Lumbar cushion comes along with a still relatively adjustable and consistently excellent neck cushion in addition to the small tool set that you can use to not only build but adjust small parts of the chair. Apart from the armrests you can buy pretty much all the same addons as you can for the Titan including new wheels that are better for different surfaces. You know I love my Titan Evo but the Older Omega 2020 has this one. WINNER OMEGA 2022 Titan Evo 2022 VS Omega 2020 Value and availability The Secretlab Titan is not cheap. It starts at 439 and goes all the way up to a 1099 Napa leather version. The version I have is the Softweave in the Cookies and Cream decoration which costs 589. That is for lack of a better term an expensive chair. For what you get its well worth the price but it is a tough price to swallow. It is also supremely available. There are loads of designs with only a few out of stock. There are different finishes including a PU leather the aforementioned softweave and Napa leather as well as an Exotic officially licensed Lamborghini option. If they go out of stock they are frequently brought back and you can preorder outofstock options to make sure you get one. The Omega on the hand is a fair bit less expensive. It currently starts at 389 and you can choose between a few different decorations and materials. My version is the KDA League of Legends special edition which comes in at 459. Thats a PU leather version of the chair. While the chair is slightly cheaper however youll find that because it is now end of line there are far fewer options to choose from as the chair is no longer being built. Youll save money yes but youll get fewer designs to choose from. In this case the Titan pulls out slightly ahead. The chair may be more expensive but youve more options to choose from and you still get excellent value for money. If you want to save money above all else though Then the Omega 2020 is the way to go. WINNER Titan Evo 2022 And the winner isthe Secretlab Titan Evo 2022 Before talking about why the Titan is better its well worth reminding ourselves that both of these are fabulous chairs. The Omega despite being slightly older comes very close in build quality and even does better when you look at what stuff you get in the box. It even in my opinion looks better than the Titan. Honestly if youre looking to save a little money when youre buying a desk chair from Secretlab then the Omega is a great way to do it. It does however trip over occasionally when you compare it to the Titan Evo 2022. The Titan is far more featurepacked with more lumbar adjustability in the back and with sturdier feeling hinges and tilting. Its also more comfortable for people of all shapes and sizes. If the bigger XL chair would be too big for you you can opt for one of a range of different sizes from the XS for kids through an S and regular size. The XL will cost you a lot more so if you can fit in the regular its worth the saving. The Titan beats out the Omega in most ways including comfort and build. It also in my opinion presents a better value package and its easier to get a hold of. While both of these Secretlab options are excellent the Secretlab Titan Evo 2022 is the better gaming and desk chair. The biggest and the best The Secretlab Titan is the best of these two options. Its unrivalled comfort and cool features let it pull in front. Just choose a cool color or special edition design to make it stand out a little more. Brilliant but not the best While it may not have beaten out the Titan Evo 2022 the Secretlab Omega 2020 is still an excellent gaming chair. If youre looking for a Secretlab chair and want to save some money this is the way to do it. iMore Newsletter Get the best of iMore in in your inbox every day As the Buying Guides and Deals writer for iMore Tammy puts over a decade of experience in finding the best prices of Apple products to work helping you save money on the equipment that you want.

15,Riches review – prepare to be addicted to this Jackie Collins-esque drama,"Soapy, slick and thoroughly enjoyable, this series about the battle to inherit a Black beauty brand is like Empire meets Dynasty meets Footballers’ Wives. It’s confident, escapist funThere is a moment during a particularly climactic scene in the big, juicy me…",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/22/riches-review-juicy-melodrama-rotten-roots-filthy-rich,There is a moment during a particularly climactic scene in the big juicy melodrama that is Riches ITVX in which a scorned wife throws a bowl full of fruit across a boardroom table and screams You bitch Its a good indication of the level of bombast this fantastically overthetop series is going for which seems to be Empire meets Dynasty meets Footballers Wives. So far the new dramas launched by ITVX have been pretty straight and serious but this is far more tongueincheek. It is soapy slick and thoroughly enjoyable. Hugh Quarshie is Stephen Richards the founder and boss of Flair and Glory a Black hair and beauty brand so successful it has turned him into a titan of British industry. Riches begins with Stephen conveniently doing an interview with a journalist allowing him to give us plenty of background on the story. Nobody would lend him the money to start the business he explains. They said Black models dont sell magazines. Nobody believed in his vision. But now look where he is. This is the kind of show that is built on buildings filled with framed magazine covers on the wall big leather sofas and floortoceiling glass windows. Stephen has made it and his family is filthy rich. The most crucial fact however and the basis for all the action to come emerges from a question about why his two eldest children from his first marriage are not involved in the business. He refuses to answer but weve got our bait to keep watching. What is he hiding and where are those children now Roll credits which are incidentally very similar to the credits of The Good Fight. Riches is about to put the two sides of Stephens family at war and we are here for the fallout. Over in New York Stephens eldest children are living without their fathers involvement or financial support. Nina Deborah Ayorinde is a successful businesswoman whom we meet as she is celebrating a successful business thing. I want you to take the rest of the day off her boss tells the office which is a very unNew York thing to do. Nina is outwardly together but she is also attracted to handsome men whom she abruptly discards after she gets what she wants from them which suggests she has commitment issues. Her brother Si Emmanuel Imani is a hair and makeup artist with a handsome boyfriend and extremely tight trousers. They are estranged from Stephen his first wife their mother maintains that he abandoned his young family and left them penniless and alone. Theres a touch of the Jackie Collins to Riches so without spoiling too much lets just say that events conspire to get Nina and Si over to London where they must do battle for the future of Flair and Glory. Their halfsiblings Stephens younger children by his current wife Claudia Ted Lassos Sarah Niles playing a very different kind of woman here appear to have been far more indulged by their fathers wealth and do not have it quite so together. Gus is the playboy son who lets his fake friends rinse his credit cards in clubs so he has people to hang out with. He is the Kendall Roy of this operation and he drives expensive fast cars. Alesha Adeyinka Akinrinade is a wannabe makeup influencer who really needs to check her phone more often. Wanda Nneka Okoye is the sensible one though only by comparison who has a boyfriend who may turn out to be nice or creepy this show insists that you be suspicious of just about everyones motives and perhaps unfairly he has shot to the top of my list.

16,James Webb Space Telescope discovers its first exoplanet,The James Webb Space Telescope has been used to confirm the existence of an exoplanet for the first time. The space observatory also spied a dusty debris disk around a nearby star and a star-forming region in a neighboring galaxy.,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/11/world/webb-telescope-exoplanet-scn/index.html,Sign up for CNNs Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries scientific advancements and more. The James Webb Space Telescope can add another cosmic accomplishment to its list The space observatory has been used to confirm the existence of an exoplanet for the first time. The celestial body known as LHS 475 b and located outside of our solar system is almost exactly the same size as Earth. The rocky world is 41 lightyears away in the Octans constellation. Previous data collected by NASAs Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite or TESS had suggested the planet might exist. A team of researchers led by staff There is no question that the planet is there. Webbs pristine data validate it LustigYaeger said The planets discovery was announced Wednesday at the 241st meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle. The fact that it is also a small rocky planet is impressive for the observatory Stevenson said. Webb is the only telescope that has the capability to characterize the atmospheres of exoplanets that are the size of Earth. The research team used Webb to analyze the planet across multiple wavelengths of light to see whether it has an atmosphere. For now the team hasnt been able to make any definitive conclusions but the telescopes sensitivity picked up on a range of molecules that were present. There are some terrestrialtype atmospheres that we can rule out LustigYaeger said. It cant have a thick methanedominated atmosphere similar to that of Saturns moon Titan. The astronomers will have another chance to observe the planet again over the summer and conduct followup analysis on the potential presence of an atmosphere. Webbs detections also revealed that the planet is a few hundred degrees warmer than our planet. If the researchers detect any clouds on LHS 475 b it may turn out to be more like Venus which is considered to be Earths hotter twin with a carbon dioxide atmosphere. Were at the forefront of studying small rocky exoplanets LustigYaeger said. We have barely begun scratching the surface of what their atmospheres might be like. The planet completes a single orbit around its red dwarf host star every 2 Earth days. Given that the star is less than half the temperature of our sun its possible that the planet could still maintain an atmosphere despite its close proximity to the star. The researchers believe their discovery will just be the first of many in Webbs future. These first observational results from an Earthsized rocky planet open the door to many future possibilities for studying rocky planet atmospheres with Webb said Mark Clampin Astrophysics Division director at NASA Headquarters in a statement. Webb is bringing us closer and closer to a new understanding of Earthlike worlds outside the Solar System and the mission is only just getting started. A dusty disk More Webb observations were shared at the meeting on Wednesday including neverbeforeseen views of a dusty disk swirling around a nearby red dwarf star. The telescopes images mark the first time such a disk has been captured in these infrared wavelegnths of light which are invisible to the human eye. The dusty disk around the star named AU Mic represents the remnants of planet formation. When small solid objects called planetesimals a planet in the making crashed into each other they left behind a big dusty ring around the star and formed a debris disk. A debris disk is continuously replenished by collisions of planetesimals. By studying it we get a unique window into the recent dynamical history of this system said lead study author Kellen Lawson postdoctoral program fellow at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland and member of the research team that studied AU Mic. Webbs capabilities allowed astronomers to see the region close to the star. Their observations and data could provide insights that aid in the search for giant planets that form wide orbits in planetary systems not unlike Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. The AU Mic disk is located 32 lightyears away in the Microscopium constellation. The star is about 23 million years old so planet formation has already ceased around the star since that process usually takes less than 10 million years according to the researchers. Other telescopes have spotted two planets orbiting the star. This system is one of the very few examples of a young star with known exoplanets and a debris disk that is near enough and bright enough to study holistically using Webbs uniquely powerful instruments said study coauthor Josh Schlieder principal investigator for the observing program at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center. The formation of stars The Webb telescope was also used to peer inside NGC 346 a starforming region located in a neighboring dwarf galaxy called the Small Magellanic Cloud. About 2 billion A galaxy during cosmic noon wouldnt have one NGC 346 as the Small Magellanic Cloud does it would have thousands said Margaret Meixner an astronomer at the Universities Space Research Association and principal investigator of the research team in a statement. Even if NGC 346 is now the one and only massive cluster furiously forming stars in its galaxy it offers us a great opportunity to probe the conditions that were in place at cosmic noon. Observing how stars form in this galaxy allows astronomers to compare star formation in our own Milky Way galaxy. In the new Webb image forming stars can be seen pulling in ribbonlike gas and dust from a surrounding molecular cloud. This material feeds the formation of stars and eventually planets. Were seeing the building blocks not only of stars but also potentially of planets said coinvestigator Guido De Marchi a space science faculty member of the European Space Agency in a statement. And since the Small Magellanic Cloud has a similar environment to that of galaxies during cosmic noon its possible that rocky planets could have formed earlier in the history of the Universe than we might have thought.,Riches review – prepare to be addicted to this Jackie Collins-esque drama,Extremely Positive,540,"['soapy', 'Flair', 'filthy', 'refuses', 'bait', 'fallout', 'abruptly', 'issues', 'estranged', 'conspire', 'Flair', 'fake', 'hang', 'expensive', 'creepy', 'suspicious', 'unfairly', 'twists', 'unpopular', 'villainous', 'inevitably', 'harsh', 'wrong', 'Flair', 'bloodthirsty', 'vicious', 'rotten']","['bitch', 'Fight', 'playboy', 'shit', 'fight']","[Hugh, Quarshie, Stephen, Richards, Stephen, Stephen, Stephens, Stephens, Nina, Deborah, Ayorinde, Nina, Si, Emmanuel, Imani, Stephen, Nina, Si, Flair, Stephens, Claudia, Ted, Lassos, Sarah, Niles, Gus, the, Kendall, Roy, Alesha, Adeyinka, Akinrinade, Wanda, Nneka, Okoye, 'lawsuit', Gideon, Downtons, Brendan, Coyle, Claudia, Si, Glory]"

Shares of tech giant Alibaba led the gains leaping 9 to a sixmonth high before closing 8. 7 higher after news emerged over the weekend that founder Jack Ma was ceding control of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group following Chinas crackdown on tech companies since 2020. The stock had fallen 27 in 2022. Ma an outspoken teacher turned tech titan was once a highprofile jetsetter and the face of Chinas Big Tech. But he has been lying low since October 2020 after giving a speech criticizing Chinas financial regulatory system. His words angered the Chinese authorities prompting intense regulatory scrutiny of his businesses and a wider crackdown on tech firms in the country. The Financial Times reported in November Ma had been living in Tokyo for six months and he was spotted last week in Bangkok Thailand. However on December 29 Chinas Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission approved Ant to more than double its registered capital in its consumer finance arm to 18. 5 billion Chinese yuan 2. 7 billion. This led to an 18 gain in Alibabas stock price last week as the market believes the governmental investment means that the conflict between Jack Ma and the authorities has come to an end Ming Lu the China head at Singaporebased Aequitas Research wrote in a note on Monday. Furthermore a top Chinese central bankers suggested over the weekend that Beijings tech crackdown is coming to a close fuelling positive sentiment in the countrys tech sector. The Hang Seng Tech Index an index that tracks the 30 largest tech companies listed in Hong Kong closed 3. 2 higher.

Chinas reopening momentum has been fasterthanmarket and our own expectations though it has resulted in a temporary surge in new cases and depressed mobility we think investors should or will look through and focus on an eventual economic and earnings recovery later in 2023 Nomura analysts in a note on Monday morning. While sentiment is high amid Chinas economic reopening some analysts caution the ride may be bumpy as the country battles a massive surge in COVID19 infections after reversing pandemic policies abruptly last month.

The famed investor discussed inflation and retirement and blasted deceptive earnings adjustments. Here are Buffetts 10 best quotes of 2022. Warren Buffett called out stockmarket gamblers dismissed bitcoin as worthless and lauded Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos in 2022. The 92yearold investor said hes not planning to retire as Berkshire Hathaway CEO anytime soon slammed companies that report misleading financials and recommended one way for people to offset inflation. He made the comments in his yearly shareholder letter at Berkshires annual meeting and during an interview with Charlie Rose. Here are Buffetts 10 best quotes of 2022 lightly edited for length and clarity 1. Charlie and I are not stockpickers we are businesspickers. Buffett was referring to his longtime business partner and Berkshires vicechairman Charlie Munger. 2. Deceptive adjustments to earnings to use a polite description have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks have risen. Speaking less politely I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull. 3. Teaching like writing has helped me develop and clarify my own thoughts. Charlie calls this phenomenon the orangutan effect If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas you may leave behind a puzzled primate but will yourself exit thinking more clearly. 4. I know Ill win over time. That doesnt mean Ill beat everybody else or anything like that. But the game is very very very easy if you have the right lessons in your mind about what youre buying. Buffett was underscoring that he views shares as pieces of a business. 5. We have a successor in place but hes not warming up. Im in overtime but Im out there. 6. Elon is taking on General Motors and Ford and Toyota and all these people whove got all this stuff and hes got an idea and hes winning. Thats America. You cant dream it up. Its astounding. 7. It couldnt happen but it did. If theyd stopped in Omaha on the drive from New York to Seattle and hed said What do you think of this idea I would have said Good luck Jeff. Buffett was referring to Amazons unlikely evolution from an online bookseller to a technology titan under founder Jeff Bezos. 8. Sometimes the stock market is quite investmentoriented and other times its almost totally a casino a gambling parlor and that existed to an extraordinary degree in the last couple of years encouraged by Wall Street. 9. If you told me you owned all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for 25 I wouldnt take it because what would I do with it I would have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isnt going to do anything. 10. The best protection against inflation is still your own personal earnings power. The best investment by far is anything that develops yourself.

21,"The best gaming laptops from CES 2023: ROG, Alienware, Razer, and more","With so many gaming laptops announced at CES 2023, it takes something special to stand out from the crowd. Here are the best we saw at the show.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/best-gaming-laptops-ces-2023/,Gaming laptops have been a big deal at CES 2023. Thanks to the latest chips from Intel AMD and Nvidia weve had a huge slate of new gaming laptops to check out at the show this year. But the ones that stood out did more than just update to the latest RTX 40series graphics cards. These are the devices that ventured into something new and presented an interesting new vision for the future of gaming ROG Zephyrus M16 If theres one gaming laptop this year that has some serious momentum behind it this is the one. The ROG Zephyrus M16 is already a popular laptop but this year its getting pretty serious overhaul. It has a new chassis that looks more refined while also bringing over features like the customizable AniMe Matrix backlit lid. This might seem like an odd place to start especially since the ROG Zephyrus G16 is actually the flagship model. But I went with the ROG Zephyrus M16 because of what Asus is doing with its Nebula Its panel has 1024 local dimming zones making it one of the best miniLED panels weve seen on a gaming laptop. The benefit is a brighter highercontrast panel that should have much better Razer Blade 16 Razer came to the show with two brandnew gaming Most interestingly the Razer Blade 16 features a dualmode miniLED display. That means you can switch between The Razer Blade 16 also features a 1610 display the first of Razers gaming Alienware x14 R2 The Alienware x14 was already a unique gaming laptop given its tiny stature. It wasnt the most powerful system in the world but that was never its aim. The secondgeneration Alienware x14 R2 keeps the crown for being the thinnest gaming laptop on the market without changing dimensions while still making some significant changes. The exterior of the device has been redesigned now featuring an aluminum lid and embossed X. It both looks and feels really premium despite keeping much of the Alienware design language intact. Beyond that the Alienware x14 R2 features an updated screen now with a resolution of 2560 x 1600 and a 165Hz refresh rate. I dont know that youll be able to play many games at the native resolution but we dont know exactly how powerful these latest RTX GPUs are yet. Speaking of GPUs the Alienware x14 R2 is still maxed out at just the RTX 4060 due to the fact that its entirely powered by USBC. To keep things cool the Alienware x14 R2 continues to use the same Thermal 31 thermal compound inside but now applies it to both the CPU and GPU. Theres also a Dellexclusive technology called Smart Fan that allows each of the two fans to spin up or down independently of one another. MSI Titan GT77 HX Yes there are a lot of miniLED gaming First off its the only 17inch miniLED panel weve seen this year while the rest are a smaller 16inch size. More importantly though the Titan GT77HX has a 169 MSI says the updated Titan will be the first of this new crop of miniLED gaming laptops that youll actually be able to buy while many others will arrive later in the year. ROG Zephyrus G14 The everpopular ROG Zephyrus G14 didnt get a big redesign this year. However there are two really important updates from Asus that significantly change the capabilities of this little gaming laptop. First off we know now that configurations will be offered up to an RTX 4090 thanks to a switch from AMD graphics to Nvidia. Those highend configurations will no doubt be expensive but should greatly expand the performance capabilities of this thin and light gaming laptop. The second big update is the screen. A configuration is now being offered with a miniLED screen matching Asus Nebula MSI Cyborg 15 999. Thats how much this new entrylevel gaming laptop from MSI costs. You might be surprised to see a laptop of this type on this list especially since that base price only gets you a 13thgen Core i5 and an RTX 4050. But lets get real times are tough right now and Im always on the hunt for gaming The MSI Cyborg 15 is a new design that has some interesting design traits such as translucent side walls and bottom cover. They give the laptop a unique look allowing you to take a peek into some of the internals. Editors Recommendations Microsoft just scored a big win with Apple I streamlined my PC VR setup and now I use it more than ever Why the MacBook Pro is the perfect gaming laptop for me As a laptop reviewer this is the CES 2023 laptop Im most excited for Heres everything I learned using the HTC Vive XR Elite at CES 2023,"

24,Take Five: Welcome to 2023 - Reuters,"A potential shift by the world's most dovish major central bank, inflation pressures abating, a turn in the economic outlook and oil markets suffering their biggest tumble in decades: Welcome to 2023!",https://www.reuters.com/business/take-five/global-markets-themes-takealook-2023-01-06/,Take Five Welcome to 2023 LONDON Jan 6 Reuters A potential shift by the worlds most dovish major central bank inflation pressures abating a turn in the economic outlook and oil markets suffering their biggest tumble in decades Welcome to 2023 A raft of data should shed light on some of those trends and tribulations while in the United States the earnings season begins. Heres a look at the week ahead in markets from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo Lewis Krauskopf in New York and Amanda Cooper Naomi Rovnick and Karin Strohecker in London. 1 EARNINGS AND INFLATION The week ahead brings a critical read into two key themes for Wall Street in 2023 the health of corporate profits and inflation. Corporate America starts reporting fourthquarter results and investors will be looking for signs of a potential economic slowdown filtering through to companies bottom lines. Friday alone sees results from banks Wells Fargo WFC. N and Citigroup C. N healthcare titan UnitedHealth Group UNH. N asset manager BlackRock BLK. N and Delta Air Lines DAL. N. Consensus analyst estimates call for a 1. 6 decline in SP 500 Q4 earnings versus the yearago period according to Refinitiv IBES. Some reckon 2023 projections are still too rosy given recession risks. Meanwhile the December U. S. consumer price index is out on Thursday. Any signs that inflation continues to ease will not only reinforce the peak rates view but could fuel talk that rate cuts could come later this year. 2 GAME OF CHICKEN Investors will have a keen eye on Tokyos inflation numbers on Tuesday the data point that first tipped the market to a potential Bank of Japan BOJ policy shift. The Tokyo data which frontruns the national numbers often by several weeks surged to a fourdecade high in the previous reading on Nov. 25. Less than a month later the BOJ raised the tolerance ceiling for Japans 10year government bond yield catching market players wrongfooted. The yen has strengthened to sevenmonth highs on rising expectations for a further hawkish shift even as BOJ officials maintain the move was a oneoff. Their next policy decision comes on Jan. 18. Australias inflation data follows on Wednesday and could be crucial for a Reserve Bank board that is finely poised between pausing rate hikes and accelerating them. 3 A CRUDE AWAKENING Crude oil markets are off to a rocky start kicking off 2023 with a near doubledigit tumble in the worst start to a year in three decades. The outlook is far from certain. Worries about a recession especially in the worlds top two consumers the United States and China weigh heavily. But potential supply chain problems could provide support. Insuring vessels to ship Kazakh crude a replacement option for Russian crude for European consumers via the Black Sea could prove more expensive and challenging. A waiver for Russian oil shipments subject to a price cap introduced in early December runs out on Jan. 19. After that sanctions kick in for shipments breaching regulations. With crude oil volatility soaring 2023 might be anything but plain sailing for producers and consumers alike. 4 TROUBLE AND INDUSTRIAL STRIFE Transport and public sector strikes a softening housing market redhot inflation and consumers too fearful to spend. Thats the backdrop for November UK economic output data on Friday likely confirming that a lengthy recession is coming. Following nine consecutive rate rises by the Bank of England and more to come British mortgage approvals sunk to their lowest level in November since the coronavirusinduced market slump of June 2020 recent data showed. As price pressures and higher borrowing costs bite Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has pledged to halve inflation grow the economy reduce public debt and cut health service waiting lists. Still Deutsche Bank sees high inflation persisting this year no rate cuts until 2024 and fiscal policies becoming more austere. Barclays expects the UK economy to keep contracting until the end of the third quarter of 2023. 5 GREEN SHOOTS For the euro area at least the first green shoots of economic hope are emerging. Inflation is tumbling thanks to a decline in wholesale natural gas and power prices. Gas storage tanks boast healthy inventory levels and temperatures are mild after a vicious cold snap in early December. Dutch natural gas futures a benchmark for the region have wiped out all the gains made after Russias invasion of Ukraine last February. It takes time for declines in market prices to filter through into household bills but signs are positive for cashstrapped consumers and businesses. Average fuel prices are down sharply from the highs of mid2022 as well. Economic recovery may still be a way off but the anticipated recession might not be quite as bad as expected gas prices and data releases in coming days will no doubt be watched closely.

25,‘I didn’t steal funds’ says former crypto titan Bankman-Fried,"In a highly unusual post-arrest blogpost a month after his arrest, he said he 'didn't stash billions away'.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/1/12/i-didnt-steal-funds-says-former-crypto-titan-bankman-fried,I didnt steal funds says former crypto titan BankmanFried In a highly unusual postarrest blogpost a month after his arrest he said he didnt stash billions away. Sam BankmanFried has said he did not steal money and blamed the collapse of his nowbankrupt FTX exchange on a broad crash in cryptocurrency markets in a highly unusual blog post a month after his arrest on US fraud charges. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan in December said BankmanFried stole billions of dollars from FTX customers to pay debts for his cryptocurrencyfocused hedge fund Alameda Research buy lavish real estate and donate to US political campaigns. He has pleaded not guilty. The Substack blog post a rare public statement by a US criminal defendant amounts to a preview of the defence case BankmanFried may present when his trial begins on October 2. I didnt steal funds and I certainly didnt stash billions away BankmanFried wrote. Defence lawyers typically advise clients to stay silent before trial because prosecutors may use their comments against them in court. A spokesman for BankmanFried declined to comment. A spokesman for the US Attorneys Office in Manhattan declined to comment. In the post BankmanFried did not directly address many of the other charges brought against him by federal prosecutors in Manhattan last month namely that he misled investors and lenders about the financial conditions of FTX and Alameda. He wrote that he had a lot more to say. The 30yearold onetime billionaire wrote that Alameda failed to hedge against an extreme crash in the cryptocurrency markets which ultimately came to pass last year. As Alameda became illiquid FTX International did as well because Alameda had a margin position open on FTX BankmanFried wrote. Last month two of his closest associates pleaded guilty to defrauding the trading platforms customers and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors investigation. Caroline Ellison Alamedas former chief executive said in her plea hearing that BankmanFried and other FTX executives received billions of dollars in secret loans from Alameda. BankmanFried was released on a 250m bond in December and put under house arrest at his parents Palo Alto California home which was pledged as collateral for his return to court. Best recovery scenario In the post BankmanFried also said FTXs US wing is fully solvent and that its international unit has many billions of dollars in assets. If it were to reboot I believe there is a real chance that customers could be made substantially whole he wrote. The comments came after a lawyer for FTX on Wednesday told a federal bankruptcy court in Delaware that the exchange had located more than 5bn in liquid assets and that the company plans to sell nonstrategic investments that had a book value of 4. 6bn. That did not include assets seized by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas where FTX was based and where BankmanFried lived before he was extradited to the United States. Bahamian authorities said they have seized 3. 5bn but FTX says those funds are worth as little as 170m. On Wednesday night BankmanFried replied on Twitter to a user named wassielawyer who said a sale of the FTX exchange was viable. yup my sense is that is and always has been the best recovery scenario for customers wrote BankmanFried. FTX declared bankruptcy on November 11 the same day BankmanFried stepped down as chief executive officer.,Take Five: Welcome to 2023,Extremely Positive,370,"['suffering', 'tumble', 'critical', 'decline', 'recession', 'risks', 'hawkish', 'CRUDE', 'Crude', 'rocky', 'tumble', 'worst', 'Worries', 'recession', 'problems', 'crude', 'crude', 'expensive', 'challenging', 'crude', 'volatility', 'TROUBLE', 'STRIFE', 'fearful', 'recession', 'sunk', 'slump', 'debt', 'austere', 'decline', 'tanks', 'vicious', 'cold', 'declines', 'sharply', 'recession', 'bad', 'doubt']",[],"[Kevin, Buckland, Lewis, Krauskopf, Amanda, Cooper, Naomi, Rovnick, Karin, Strohecker, Rishi, Sunak]"

27,Here's Why You Should Buy Disney Stock Before the End of 2022,The entertainment titan is poised to rally in 2023.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/12/22/why-you-should-buy-disney-stock/,From 2005 to 2020 Bob Iger helped to transform Walt Disney DIS 0. 41 into a media colossus. Iger spearheaded Disneys acquisitions of Pixar Marvel and Lucasfilm which brought popular franchises like Toy Story The Avengers and Star Wars under the companys expansive umbrella. After a short stint of retirement Iger is now back at Disneys helm. His current mission is to bolster the entertainment giants sagging profits and hes likely to do just that. Heres why you might want to buy Disneys stock now before Iger begins to work his magic. From losses to profits Disneys streaming subscriber growth is impressive. The company ended its fiscal 2022 on Oct. 1 with over 164 million Disney customers along with an additional 47 million subscribers for Hulu and 24 million for ESPN. For context Disneys total of 235 million streaming subscribers surpassed that of Netflix which ended the third quarter with roughly 223 million members. That said Disneys streaming operations have yet to produce a profit. The division has racked up billions of dollars in losses due largely to Disneys heavy investments in content and technology. Yet recently enacted price increases and a new advertisingsupported offering should help Disney reach profitability in fiscal 2024. Iger is also working to restructure the business to reduce costs which should make it even more likely that streaming will become another powerful driver of longterm profit growth for the company by that time. A rebound in travel demand Disneys highly profitable parks and resorts have more than offset its streaming losses. Revenue in the companys parks experiences and products division surged 73 year over year to 28. 7 billion in fiscal 2022 as COVIDrelated restrictions were lifted. The segments operating income in turn increased more than sixteenfold to 7. 9 billion. Traffic at Disneys theme parks resorts and cruise ships should continue to head higher in 2023 as COVID fears subside. At the same time price hikes are likely to bolster the segments already impressive profitability. Disneys stock is on sale The share prices of many highquality companies are down sharply in the current bear market. Unfortunately Disney has not been spared the carnage. Its stock price is down more than 40 over the past year. But these steep price drops allow bear markets to create tremendous bargains for investors. We have one such opportunity with Disney today. Its shares can currently be had for less than 22 times its projected earnings per share in fiscal 2023. Thats a great price for a business with an unrivaled collection of assets that analysts forecast to grow its pershare profits by nearly 24 annually over the next five years. Disney could deliver handsome gains to investors in 2023 Continued subscriber gains progress toward streaming profitability and rising profits at Disneys parks and resorts could all help to drive the entertainment giants stock price higher in 2023. Combined with investors welldeserved confidence in Igers leadership these positive trends could also result in a higher pricetoearnings PE ratio for Disneys shares. Solid earnings growth together with the potential for PE multiple expansion is a powerful formula for shareholder gains and Disneys investors appear set to enjoy just that in the year ahead.,"MSI reveals an army of laptops, monitors, PC components, and more at CES 2023",Somewhat Positive,130,"['avalanche', 'unfortunately', 'ridiculous', 'steal', 'ludicrous', 'problem']",['desire'],"['lawsuit', Zachary, Boddy, Zachary, Zachary, BoddyZachary]"
28,Better Buy: Apple vs. Nvidia,Which tech titan is the better bear market investment?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/12/25/better-buy-apple-vs-nvidia/,Apple AAPL 1. 01 and Nvidia NVDA 2. 35 were both beloved tech stocks that lost their luster over the past year. Apples stock hit an alltime high of 180. 96 in January but it subsequently stumbled back to the 130s. Nvidias stock closed at a record high of 333. 41 last November but it now trades in the 160s. Both stocks declined as inflation rising interest rates and other macro headwinds drove investors toward more conservative investments. Both companies also grappled with their own specific problems Apple faced slower sales of iPhones and supply chain disruptions while Nvidia struggled with the postpandemic slowdown of the PC market. Could either of these outoffavor tech stocks bounce back in 2023 and beyond Lets review their tailwinds headwinds and valuations to decide. What happened to Apple Apples revenue and earnings per share EPS increased 33 and 71 respectively in fiscal 2021 which ended in September 2021 after it finally entered the 5G market with its iPhone 12 family of smartphones. Its revenue and EPS rose another 8 and 9 respectively in fiscal 2022 even after it lapped that launch and faced new supply chain headwinds. For the full year Apples iPhone sales rose 7 and its Mac sales increased 14 even as the market for Windows PCs slumped while its Wearables Home and Accessories sales grew 7 as it sold more Apple Watches AirPods and other peripheral products. Its Services revenue also rose 14 as it locked in more than 900 million paid subscribers across its entire ecosystem. All of those growth engines offset its 8 decline in iPad sales. But fiscal 2023 will be a lot messier. Apples main contract manufacturer Foxconn grappled with disruptions in November as workers at its largest iPhone plant protested its COVID19 restrictions and unpaid bonuses. Apple already reduced its annual production target for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max from 90 million to 87 million units to account for those challenges but future protests could generate more unpredictable headwinds for Apple. Yet Apple still ended fiscal 2022 with 169 billion in cash and marketable securities and it bought back a whopping 550 million in shares over the past decade. That strong liquidity should make Apple an appealing investment as long as rising rates continue to crush unprofitable companies with weak cash flows. Apple is also widely expected to launch a new mixed reality headset next year and that product might just generate a fresh stream of hardware revenue. Based on those expectations analysts believe Apples revenue and earnings will grow 3 and 2 respectively this year. Those growth rates are steady but at 22 times forward earnings Apples stock isnt cheap yet. What happened to Nvidia Nvidia controlled 88 of the discrete GPU market in the third quarter of 2022 according to JPR. The remaining 12 was split between Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. Its revenue and adjusted EPS soared 53 and 73 respectively in fiscal 2021 which ended in January 2021. In fiscal 2022 its revenue rose another 61 as its adjusted EPS increased 78. Most of that growth was driven by three tailwinds Robust sales of PCs throughout the pandemic as more people worked remotely attended online classes and played more PC games. A growing interest in mining cryptocurrencies with gaming GPUs. Usage of more powerful GPUs in data centers to process complex machine learning and AI tasks. But in fiscal 2023 analysts expect its revenue to stay flat and for its EPS to slip by 27. That slowdown was caused by the postpandemic deceleration of the PC market sluggish sales in China amid the COVID19 lockdowns and tighter gaming restrictions and the crypto markets decline which all offset its robust sales of data center GPUs. The Biden administrations ban on advanced chip sales to China which impacts its toptier data center chips will exacerbate that slowdown. For fiscal 2024 analysts expect Nvidias revenue and earnings to rise 9 and 32 respectively as those markets gradually stabilize. But at 38 times forward earnings Nvidias stock still looks a bit pricey relative to its nearterm growth. But just like Apple Nvidia still has plenty of cash. It ended its latest quarter with 2. 8 billion in cash and equivalents and it bought back 8. 8 billion in shares throughout the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. That ample liquidity gives it plenty of room to develop new chips expand into new markets and acquire smaller companies even though antitrust regulators killed its proposed 40 billion takeover of SoftBanks Arm Holdings earlier this year. The obvious winner Apple Apple faces a nearterm slowdown but its business is much better diversified and less cyclical than Nvidias. Its also sitting on a lot more cash its stock is cheaper and it arguably has more options for expanding its portfolio of products and services than Nvidia. Therefore I firmly believe Apple is a better buy than Nvidia in this challenging market for tech stocks.,Here's Why You Should Buy Disney Stock Before the End of 2022,Extremely Positive,80,"['sagging', 'losses', 'losses', 'losses', 'fears', 'sharply', 'Unfortunately', 'carnage', 'steep']",[],"[Bob, Iger, Iger, Iger, Iger, Iger]"
