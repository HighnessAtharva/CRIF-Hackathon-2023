NVIDIA has announced that its bringing GeForce Now game streaming to cars using the companys Drive platform. The rollout will offer access to titles like Cyberpunk 2077 on a driver display while youre charging or parked or any time from the backseat. That could be more than a little helpful on a vacation especially if youd rather not buy a Steam Deck or Switch for a budding young gamer. The cloud gaming option already has initial support from major brands like the Hyundai group including Genesis and Kia Polestar and Chinas BYD. NVIDIA didnt offer a timeframe for GeForce Now access although it noted that BYD would offer Drive Hyperionpowered cars in the first half of 2023. The Polestar 3 SUV built using Drive Orin arrives in late 2023. The incar GeForce Now client works on either Android or webbased infotainment systems. NVIDIAs service provides a catalog of 1500 games over 1000 of which are playable using gamepads. While most of the selection is paid there are freetoplay options like Destiny 2 and Fortnite. As with other game streaming services this could get costly if you plan to use it often. While basic GeForce Now use is free you can pay up to 200 per year for the full experience before you factor in the cost of the games themselves. In some cases though this might make more sense than buying a handheld console or tablet. You only need to pay for a higherend plan when you expect to use it after all you could subscribe during a road trip and stick to free usage when youre commuting around town.,2023-01-03T16:45:11Z,NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti leaks reveal specs and potential price,Somewhat Negative,120,"['rumors', 'rumors', 'delayed']",[],[]

However since the company hasnt yet announced pricing its harder to discern the latest models value. The Nebula display is found in more models than ever this year. That company branding denotes screens with high frame rates 120Hz for 4K and QHD screens and 240Hz or higher for 1080p bright backlights and vivid colors. Meanwhile the new Nebula HDR variant is like an ultrapremium version highlighting Mini LED panels. For example the Nebula HDR display in the Strix SCAR 16 is a Mini LED with 1024 dimming zones double last years model and a 240Hz refresh rate. Although we dont yet know the pricing its a safe bet those models will fetch top dollar. The new laptops which launch in Q2 also have updated 13thgen Intel or AMD Ryzen Zen 4 processors depending on your configuration. NVIDIAs new GeForce RTX 40 Series Laptop GPUs power the graphics in maxedout variants of the new machines. ASUS added intelligent cooling to several new models including the Zephyrus M16 and Strix models in 16inch and 18inch variants. The company accomplished this using a fullwidth heatsink spanning the devices rear. ASUS also added a third cooling fan to more models. It was first seen in the Flow X16 from 2022. That extra fan improves airflow to the GPU and other internal hardware. The Strix SCAR line which ASUS calls the performance flagships have bigger 16 and 18inch screens than their 15 and 17inch predecessors including Nebula HDR in the most expensive tiers. In addition ASUS says this years cooling improvements let these models push higher frame rates. Meanwhile the Strix G16 and G18 are slightly less highend likely cheaper equivalents to the Strix 16 and 18 with the same CPU and GPU options. ASUS is also updating its lightandthin Zephyrus line. The ROG Zephyrus M16 has a Nebula HDR display. Like several other models topshelf models include a MUX Switch and NVIDIA Advanced Optimus. They bypass the machines integrated graphics using discrete graphics almost instantaneously. The fullwidth heatsink and trifan tech also let it run 25 watts higher than the 2022 version. Meanwhile the Zephyrus G16 has the same processor and graphics options with a QHD Nebula display that supports 240Hz. Its smaller sibling the Zephyrus G14 gets a Nebula HDR panel with 504 dimming zones and 600 nits of peak brightness. ASUS Duo 16 is the latest iteration of its quirky dualscreen laptop line. Like the 2022 model the updated version has a 16inch Mini LED panel as its main screen with a smaller 4K display below for multitasking. It also joins other models in offering the new NVIDIA graphics and MUX Switch in the highestend models. The company also updated the ROG Flow its 2in1 tablet PCs for gamers. The Flow X13 which has a 360degree rotating hinge has a 13inch Nebula display supporting a 165Hz refresh rate. Additionally ASUS redesigned its chassis making it 10mm smaller and increasing its battery capacity from 62 to 75 Wh while maintaining the same keyboard layout. The company also made its touchpad bigger and redesigned the 2in1 hinge with better ventilation and an easier grip. The X13s larger companion the Flow X16 has an HDR Mini LED touchscreen with a 240Hz refresh rate and 1100 nits peak brightness. In addition all ASUS 2023 Flow devices use Cornings Gorilla Glass DXC which can increase hardness by 40 percent and reduce glare. Meanwhile the Flow Z13 a detachable thats like a Microsoft Surface for gamers is updated with the new Intel and NVIDIA components and a QHD Nebula display with a 165Hz refresh rate.,2023-01-03T19:00:25Z,NVIDIA's GeForce Now game streaming is coming to cars,Extremely Positive,50,['costly'],['backseat'],[]

It looks pretty similar to the companys previous Freestyle model but this one includes Samsungs smart TV platform and features its Gaming Hub as well. This also provides access to services such as Xbox Cloud Gaming Amazon Luna and NVIDIA GeForce Now for cloud gaming. However the real magic with this years version of Freestyle may become apparent when you have two units. When projections from the two become one as the Spice Girls might have once sang Edge Blending tech can combine them into a single ultrawide display with a 219 aspect ratio. Samsung says the patented technology can automatically keystone the picture and make adjustments for an even more immersive cinematic experience. So if you have a living room with an enormous wall or happen to know a friend with an art gallery you may be able to set up two Freestyle projectors and play Fortnite on a massive display.

At CES 2023 this week the company revealed the Flex Hybrid OLED mobile screen. It folds from one side and slides out the other. This combination not only increases the size but alters the aspect ratio too. Starting off at a relatively compact 4. 2inch device it folds out to a 10. 5inch 43 display. Then because its not done the right side slides and expands out to create a 12. 4inch display with a 1610 aspect ratio which seems like itd be ideal for watching TV and movies. Samsungs folding phones won me over in 2022 even if they could do with longer battery life. With a screen this big that has to be a major consideration for any realworld devices. Weve seen rollout displays on concept phones before. TCL teased such a device in 2021 but it never showed off a working prototype. If Samsung has one at CES well check it out when the show floor opens. Already weve been barraged by PC and TV announcements. Keep track of all the news from CES 2023 right here.

NVIDIA finally unveiled its latest midrange GPU the RTX 4070 Ti. Starting at 799 its a slightly more reasonable alternative to NVIDIAs 1199 RTX 4090 and 1599 4090. But yes its still pretty costly. Is this the new GPU midrange NVIDIA is positioning the RTX 4070 Ti as the pinnacle of 1440p gaming beyond 120 fps. DLSS 3 is a big reason for that just like with the other 4000series cards it uses machine learning to generate entire frames rather than the pixels DLSS 2 created. That means it should be able to deliver better overall frame rates. The RTX 4070 Ti will be available on January 5th. Apple is raising the price of battery replacements for older iPhones It already costs more to give newer iPhones a fresh battery. Apple is adding 20 to the price of battery replacements for preiPhone 14 models on March 1st. For notched iPhones iPhone X through iPhone 13 this will bump the price from 69 to 89. If you have an iPhone SE or iPhone 8 the price will climb from 49 to 69. Its not clear if selfrepair prices will increase at the same time. However part prices roughly equal the cost of asking Apple to perform a battery swap. The company didnt elaborate on the reasoning but last year said inflation had affected business and it raised iPhone prices in several international markets.

In short theyre not as extra as the Alienware laptop family. The G15 will start at 849 for a 13thgen Intel Core i5 with a 1920 x 1080 screen and a choice of RTX 40series GPUs from NVIDIA.

Instead of basic black or gray LG gave the Style which will come in 14 and 16inch sizes a glasscovered iridescent treatment. Also LG did away with a traditional trackpad and instead put a haptics touchpad in the area below the keyboard. But unlike other haptic touchpads like those on MacBooks theres no artificial outline for the touch area its just flat metal all the way across. So how do you find it When you go to use the touchpad the left and right boundaries light up. Read more about the Gram Style.

10,Nvidia unveils GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for laptops,Nvidia unveiled the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti graphics card using its latest graphics processing unit (GPU) chip.,https://venturebeat.com/games/nvidia-unveils-geforce-rtx-40-series-gpus-for-laptops/,Nvidia unveiled the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti graphics card using its latest graphics processing unit GPU chip. It also showed off laptops with a whole family of 40 Series GPUs. The 4070 desktop GPU will sell for 800 and will be available on January 5 for custom addon boards. The Santa Clara Californiabased company said the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is faster than the predecessor GeForce RTX 3090 Ti at nearly half the power thanks to its new Nvidia Ada Lovelace architecture innovations and Nvidia DLSS 3 deep learning super sampling technology. The GPUs are part of the 40 Series family that the company began introducing last fall and they will compete against the latest offerings from Advanced Micro Devices Radeon GPU family. Nvidia made the announcement at an online event ahead of the CES 2023 tech trade show in Las Vegas. Nvidia said that the GPUs will be built into more than 170 laptop models. The laptops use the new 4070 4060 and 4050 GPUs from Nvidia. And 4090 and 4080based laptops will start shipping for 2000 on February 8. Other 40 Series RTX laptops 40506070 starting at 1000 will start shipping on February 22. Nvidia said the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti will max out a 1440p monitor delivering over 120 FPS in modern games like A Plague Tale Requiem Warhammer 40000 Darktide and F1 22. Nvidia showed off a bunch of games that will take advantage of the hardware. Other titles that will use RTXs ray tracing include Cyberpunk 2077 Portal with RTX The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and many more. Jeff Fisher senior vice president of gaming at Nvidia said in the press event that gaming added 20 million new PC gamers in 2022 and 100 million since 2019. Steam hit a new peak of 32 million up 16 from 2021 while esports viewing was up 40 from the prior year he said. He noted Call of Duty Modern Warfare II hit 800 million in revenues in its opening weekend. He said the Ada Lovelace architecture launched last fall with the 4090 GPUs represented a quantum leap in PC gaming with more shader cores RT cores and Tensor cores. He showed off Witchfire a new dark fantasy firstperson shooter coming soon from The Astronaut for the PC. And he displayed Warhaven a new PC title coming from Nexon. And he showed off the coollooking Atomic Heart coming on multiple platforms from Focus Entertainment and 4Divinity. The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is targeted at gamers who play at the midrange or 1440p graphics. The GPU has 7680 CUDA Cores and 12 GB of superfast GDDR6X memory. For users with a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti or GeForce RTX 2080 the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti offers a tremendous upgrade Nvidia said. It delivers up to 12 times relative performance over the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. Nvidia DLSS uses AI to figure out the pixels that need to be displayed on a screen and more than 250 gaming and creative apps use it now. Fifty current and upcoming games are using DLSS 3. 0 which doubles the framerate of a game. AI will define the future of computing and this has influenced much of what were covering today said Fisher. AI will change gaming forever. In addition to running faster than the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti uses 43 less power on average while gaming just 226 watts versus the 3090 Tis 398 watts. And while idle web browsing or watching videos its power usage barely registers thanks to architectural enhancements of the GeForce RTX 40 Series the company said. GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs enable live streamers and video editors to use AV1 the nextgeneration codec. Livestreamers will be able to push higher resolutions and frame rates with improved quality at the current max bit rates in popular streaming apps and platforms. GeForce RTX 4070 Ti GPUs enable streaming the latest PC games with RTX at up to 4K 60FPS and 1440p 120FPS with AV1 encoding. AV1 is also enabled in the top video editing apps including Adobe Premiere Pro via the Voukoder plugin DaVinci Resolve and Jianying the top video editing app in China. Along with the improved quality that AV1 delivers GeForce RTX 4070 Ti features dual eight generation Nvidia Encoders bringing video editors up to two times video export speed. 3D creators will see up to 70 increase in performance compared to the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti in the most popular apps like Blender Unity Unreal Engine and Chaos VRay. Every existing GeForce innovation and enhancement is also available for buyers of GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards including GSYNC GeForce Experience oneclick overclocking and game optimization Shadowplay recording and so much more. Starting on January 5 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti for desktops will be available from top addin card providers Asus Colorful Gainward Galax Gigabyte INNO3D KFA2 MSI Palit PNY and Zotac as well as from gaming system integrators and builders worldwide. The new GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops are up to three times more power efficient than the previous generation and bring the Ada architecture Nvidia DLSS 3 and fifthgeneration MaxQ technologies to laptops for the first time. For gamers RTX 40 Series laptops deliver up to four times the performance in tripleA games like full raytraced Cyberpunk 2077 with new RT Overdrive Mode the company said. With the Ada architecture we set out to transform the performance and power efficiency of gaming and creator laptops said Fisher. The new RTX 40 Series delivers enthusiastclass performance in laptops as slim as 14 inches a new milestone. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 laptops The Ada architecture has also enabled a new class of enthusiast laptops that are the worlds fastest the company said. Gamers can play on three 4K monitors for surround gaming at 60 frames per second enough to power a professionalgrade driving simulator. RTX 40 Series flagship laptops 4080 and 4090 start at 2000 and will be available beginning Feb. 8. RTX 4070 4060 4050 laptops The new RTX 4070 4060 and 4050 laptops are faster than the previousgeneration flagship model using as little as onethird the GPU power. They deliver 80 fps 1440p gaming and transform creation processes like rendering scenes in Blender which used to take two and a half hours to just 10 minutes. The RTX 4050 laptops start at 1000 and will be available beginning Feb. 22. FifthGeneration MaxQ Technologies improve laptop efficiency With each new GPU generation since 2017 advancements in MaxQ technology have improved laptop design. Today alongside the launch of the GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops Nvidia is introducing its fifthgeneration MaxQ technologies which radically enhance efficiency and accelerate gaming performance using the following upgrades Nvidia DLSS 3 has been optimized for laptops and built into MaxQ technologies including Whispermode and BatteryBoost which improve performance acoustics and battery life by up to two times. The lowest voltage GDDR6 memory ever shipped in partnership with multiple manufacturers. Trispeed memory control enables the GPU to switch to newer lowerpower memory states dynamically. Adas onchip memory has been optimized for MaxQ doubling the bandwidth increasing the size by 16 times and improving clock gating. 14Inch laptops more powerful Before the introduction of the Ada architecture 95 of this fastestgrowing laptop segment was limited to basic tasks and apps Nvidia said. More than 13 million were sold last year Fisher said. Now the company said 14inch laptops can take on tasks that were previously impossible such as fast 3D rendering in Blender and cuttingedge AI tools in popular apps like Adobe Photoshop or Premiere Pro. The 14inch laptops are also gaming powerhouses up to twice as fast as a PlayStation 5 but onesixth the size. Gamers can play graphically intense tripleA games like Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing and DLSS. Purposebuilt for 110 million creators The creator market continues to grow rapidly surpassing more than 110 million professional and hobbyist PC creators. And 3D creation on Nvidia hardware specifically grew 42 since last year the company said. GeForce RTX laptop users can benefit from Nvidia Studio accelerations in over 110 of the most popular creative apps plus exclusive access to AIpowered apps like Nvidia Omniverse Canvas and Broadcast. 3D artists can collaborate with one another in Omniverse from anywhere in the world while video editors can produce on location faster with AI tools and cut export times in half with dual encoders. Creating has grown beyond photos and videos to virtual worlds rendered with 3D cinematic graphics and truetolife physics Fisher said. The RTX platform is powering this growth. Stephanie Johnson vice president of studio and gaming at Nvidia said in a press briefing that AI is transforming the work of the 110 million creators in the market and Nvidia Studio has 110 apps that make life easier for those creators. Nvidia enabled the mod Portal Prelude for its RTX Remix tool. The modding community cant wait to get their hands on Remix Johnson said. She said 90 of internet videos run at 1080p or lower but half of RTX users have higher resolution monitors. RTX video superresolution can remove blocky compression and upscale video resolution starting this February with 30 Series and 40 Series GPUs. GeForce RTX 40 Series flagship laptops will be available starting Feb. 8 from the worlds top manufacturers including Acer Alienware Asus Dell Gigabyte HP Lenovo MSI Razer and Samsung. They will also be available from local makers and system builders including CyberPower PC Eluktronics Hasee PC Specialist 3XS by Scan and Schenker with more coming in Q1.

11,Nvidia boosts generative AI for biology with BioNeMo,Nvidia and Evozyne announced BioNeMo helped build a new generative AI model that could help improve human health as well as climate change.,https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-boosts-generative-ai-for-biology-with-bionemo/,In September 2022 Nvidia announced the launch of its BioNeMo Large Language Model LLM service to help researchers build new artificial intelligence AI models for biology and its an effort that has yielded some strong early results. Today Nvidia along with biotech startup Evozyne are announcing that BioNeMo was used to help build a new generative AI model that could have a significant impact on helping improve human health as well as climate change. The generative AI model was used to create a pair of new proteins that are being detailed today. One of the proteins could one day be used to reduce carbon dioxide while the other might help to cure congenital diseases. Proteins are the building blocks of life Kimberly Powell VP of healthcare at Nvidia said during a press briefing. The field of protein engineering looks to discover new proteins that can help us design more effective drugs remove carbon from the air or make more environmentally friendly clothes. Generative AI is leading a revolution for healthcare While generative AI has become a popular topic for discussion in recent months thanks to the popularity of services like ChatGPG its application in the life sciences field is nothing short of revolutionary. Event Intelligent Security Summit OnDemand Learn the critical role of AI ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies. Watch ondemand sessions today. Earlier this week life science vendor Absci announced that it has built a generative AI model using E. coli bacteria that can create entirely new antibody drugs. IBM has developed an opensource library called Generative Toolkit for Scientific Discovery GT4SD to help advance efforts as well. Using generative AI to accelerate drug discovery is likely to be a major trend in 2023 overall as researchers look to reduce the time it takes to create new treatments. Using Nvidia BioNeMo for generative AI The Nvidia BioNeMo LLM is a model designed to help enable drug discovery. With generative AI which uses large language models as a base new things can be created based on data that the model has already been trained on. Powell explained that the number of potential proteins far exceeds the number of particles in the universe. So in order to accelerate the discovery process Evozyne and Nvidia used Nvidia BioNeMo to create the ProtVAE model for protein discovery in just a few weeks. She said that Evozyne used BioNeMo to finetune ProtVAE for a specific protein family. Once it was finetuned the new model has been used to generate an entirely new library of proteins that maintain or enhance a function in a specific family class of proteins. This model was able to invent proteins never before seen in nature Powell said. This is the capability that is going to be how we can explore the infinite universe of proteins to discover new therapies in materials energy sources and sustainable foods. VentureBeats mission is to be a digital town square for technical decisionmakers to gain knowledge about transformative enterprise technology and transact.

Depending on how you spec them though the likes of Elden Ring should still look pretty great on these laptops. First up is the latest Zenbook Pro 16X OLED which ASUS says is the most powerful Zenbook to date. Youll be able to kit it out with up to a 13thgen Intel Core processor NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40series laptop GPU and 32GB of LPDDR5X DRAM. ASUS says the Zenbook Pro 16X OLED UX7602BZ has a unique Intel processor and a Supernova SystemonModule design that reduces the size of the motherboard core area by 38 percent allowing for more efficient cooling. Theres also more space for the graphics units power components which ASUS says will deliver higher and more stable GPU performance. As the name suggests this model has an OLED display. Its a 16inch 3. 2K HDR touchscreen with an aspect ratio of 1610 and a 120Hz refresh rate. Theres an autotilting keyboard that could help you to find the ideal typing angle. Youll also be able to take advantage of the ASUS Dial which should offer more precise control in creativityfocused apps. The Zenbook Pro 14 OLED is getting a glow up too. The UX6404 model has a 2. 8K 120Hz NanoEdge Dolby Vision display with a 100 percent DCIP3 gamut and Pantone validation for accurate colors. It comes with up to a 13thgen Intel Core processor a GeForce RTX 40series laptop GPU a 2TB SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM. Theres a memory slot that can accommodate up to 32GB SODIMM as well as WiFi 6E connectivity and a 76Wh battery. ASUS says it packed all of this into a body that weighs 3. 64 lbs 1. 65 kg and is less than 0. 7 inches 1. 8 cm thick. As for the Zenbook 14X OLED UX3404 that has a 14. 5inch 2. 8K HDR display with a 1610 aspect ratio and 120Hz refresh rate. The laptop comes with up to a 13thgen Intel Core processor GeForce RTX 3050 GPU 32GB of LPDDR5 RAM a 1TB PCIe 4. 0 SSD and a 70Wh battery. The thin and light 14X comes in two colors Inkwell Gray and Sandstone Beige.

But for 2023 in addition to revamped specs ASUS is trying out a fancy new ceramic coating on the laptops lid. The process used to create the coating is called PEO or plasma electrolytic oxidation. This allows ASUS to add a lightweight but durable finish thats not only harder than traditional anodized aluminum because it doesnt require any strong acids or heavy metals during manufacturing its also more environmentally friendly. In person the Zenbook 14Xs ceramic finish feels great. It reminds me of the magnesium chassis Microsoft used on old Surfaces except that its even smoother and better at resisting fingerprints. The downside is that because this is the first time ASUS is using this process the ceramic coating is only available in one color sandstone. On the bright side if you want something a bit more traditional theres also a cheaper model with an aluminum finish in Inkwell gray. Other updates on the Zenbook 14X include a slightly larger 14. 5inch OLED touchscreen a faster 120Hz refresh rate and a taller 1610 aspect ratio. And of course performance is also getting a bump thanks to new 13thgen Intel CPUs support for up to 32GB of DDR5 RAM and even an optional RTX 3050 GPU from NVIDIA. ASUS is also adding faster WiFi 6E connectivity and with a slightly larger 70watt hour battery Im hoping we see a small boost in longevity too. Port selection looks solid as well with two Thunderbolt 4 connectors. And when it comes to making video calls theres a new full HD webcam which is up from the 720p on last years model with support for windows hello and dual mics with AI noise cancellation so you should look and sound better during meetings. Now I know some of you might be disappointed that ASUS didnt find room for Nvidias newest 40series mobile graphics cards. But considering that the Zenbook 14X weighs barely more than four pounds and isnt meant to be your main gaming machine its hard to be too upset. All told between the new ceramic coating the slightly larger display and revamped components the Zenbook 14X is shaping up to be a pretty wellequipped and stylish notebook. I just hope other people like it too because Id love to see ASUS expand the color options for the ceramic coating to more shades than just sandstone. Of course just how much of a premium you have to pay for it may play a role in its success. ASUS has not yet released pricing for the Zenbook 14X OLED though it is slated to go on sale sometime in Q2 2023.,2023-01-04T19:00:16Z,ASUS' latest Zenbook Pro 16X OLED has more space to stay cool,Extremely Positive,0,[],[],[]

But with the arrival of 13thgen CPUs from Intel and 40series mobile GPUs from NVIDIA it really feels like the company is trying to cram as much power as it possibly can in its new Blade 16 and Blade 18 notebooks. Starting with the Blade 16 you get a huge range of beefy components including up to Intel Corei9 HX chips and NVIDIAs topoftheline RTX 4090 graphics cards. On top of that while some other laptop makers sometimes try to limit the power consumption of a laptops GPU in order to preserve battery life Razer is throwing caution to the wind and will support a total graphics power TGP of 175 watts. Interestingly despite going big on performance the Blade 16 isnt that much larger than the Blade 15 with an increase in thickness of just 5mm 21. 99mm for the Blade 16 vs. 16. 99 for the Blade 15. The Blade 16 is also almost exactly the same width as its smaller sibling and less than half an inch deeper as well so theres not a huge increase in overall size despite the big jump in performance. And weighing 5. 4 pounds the Blade 16 isnt overly heavy either. That said my favorite new feature on the Blade 16 which isnt available on the larger Blade 18 is a dualmode 1610 mini LED display that supports two different native refresh rates and resolutions 4K at 120Hz or FHD at 240Hz. This choice of display modes is really handy because it lets you adjust your screen depending on what youre doing. If youre editing photos or videos you can set the screen to 120Hz at 4K in order to view your content at full resolution while also boosting peak brightness to a stunning 1000 nits. Then when you feel like winding down with a game or two you can set the display to operate in FH240Hz mode so you can take full advantage of the laptops performance. The downside is that peak brightness at 240Hz drops slightly to 600 nits though from what I saw thats still more than enough to support vivid HDR graphics. The other minor annoyance is that when you want to switch between different display modes on the Blade you will need to fully shut down and restart the system which just feels clunky. Next we move onto the Blade 18 which Razer says is simply the most powerful laptop the company has ever made. In addition to topnotch components the Blade 18 sports a gorgeous 240Hz QHD display along with a new 5MP webcam so you can live stream in high resolution without needing to plug in an external one. Also as Razers biggest and brawniest desktop replacement the Blade 18 also comes with a booming sixspeaker setup that supports THX spatial audio. And just like the Blade 16 this system offers a great selection of ports including multiple USBC jacks with Thunderbolt 4 a fullsize SD card reader HDMI 2. 1 and even an Ethernet jack which is the one port not available on the Blade 16. Unfortunately the biggest hurdle for anyone considering buying either of these systems is their price The Blade 16 starts at 2700 while the cheapest Blade 18 will go for 2900 with both models quickly moving well above 3500 when fully maxed out. Personally as much as I like the idea of a laptop thats more powerful than my midtower at home the Blade 18 is still a bit too large for my taste. But for those who need highend systems with sleek aluminum builds and have cash to burn it really feels like Razers latest addition to the Blade family are gaming laptops in a class of their own. Both systems are expected to go on sale some in Q1 2023.,2023-01-05T18:00:43Z,ASUS went with ceramic for its new Zenbook 14X OLED laptop,Extremely Positive,50,"['downside', 'bump', 'noise', 'disappointed', 'hard', 'upset']",[],[]

S. trade policy toward China supply chain disruptions effectuated by Russias invasion of Ukraine and prevailing recessionary fear blunting demand. As per Semiconductor Industry Association the global chip market contracted in October with a 4. 6 decline from the prior year driven down by the strong influence of shrinking markets in China and AsiaPacific. In addition according to a report by Gartner PC sales are falling off a cliff as worldwide PC shipments declined 19. 5 in the third quarter of 2022. While the chips sector is already bracing for waning demand as redhot inflation squeezed spending the pressure on the industry has been amplified further by recent regulatory action taken by the United States to curb chip export to China. TSMC Chairman Mark Liu said The U. S. China trade conflict and the escalation of crossStrait tensions have brought more serious challenges to all industries including the semiconductor industry. Furthermore with rapid deterioration in the global economy and weakening consumer demand Gartner expects global semiconductor revenue to decline by 3. 6 in 2023.

Demand for GPUs from the gaming industry has...",https://stocknews.com/news/nvda-umc-stm-aeis-1-stock-that-proves-you-shouldnt-buy-what-you-know/,Chip designer and computing major NVIDIA Corporation NVDA reported higherthanexpected revenues in the third quarter on the back of solid demand in its data center business. Its revenue was 1. 9 above analyst estimates. The companys EPS was 17. 6 below the consensus estimate. Its gross margin fell 11. 6 percentage points to 53. 6. Data center revenue grew 31 yearoveryear while gaming revenue declined 51 from the prioryear period. The companys revenue was hit due to soft demand from China and the U. S. governments ban on the export of GPUs A100 and H100. To counter the financial loss from the ban the company unveiled the A800 GPU which would be an alternative to the A100. The A800 complies with the export control rules and it helped NVDA lessen the financial implication of the ban. After the pandemicinduced rise in gaming NVDAs gaming segment suffered in the third quarter due to the lower GPU sales for desktops and laptops. Moreover with the severe decline in crypto mining the demand for its GPU chips has slowed down. With many analysts expecting an extended crypto winter NVDAs demand from the crypto market could take a hit. For the fiscal fourth quarter ended December 31 2022 NVDA expects its revenue to be 6 billion plus or minus 2 compared to analyst expectations of 6. 09 billion. NVDAs stock has gained 14. 4 over the past three months. On the other hand it has declined 52. 5 in price over the past year to close the last trading session at 143. 15.

Teased by AMD during its RX 7000series GPU launch in November as the first monitor announced with DisplayPort 2. 1 support the Neo G9 has 7680x2160pixel resolution. The high resolution plus HDR and fast 240Hz refresh rate make the highbandwidth DP 2. 1 essential even though its not a full 8K its a 329 aspect ratio. However theres still a bit of a disconnect between this level of resolution and GPU performance. At the moment the only GPU that can handle it with all the frills is probably the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 but Nvidia hasnt leveled up to DP 2. 1 HDMI 2. 1 can support it but only at 60Hz. AMDs RX 7900 XTX does have DP2. 1 connections but isnt quite up to that level or might be but just under limited circumstances. Its slated to ship later this year but we dont know how much this bad boy is going to cost.

In addition to the QDOLED panel the G9 has 5120x1440pixel resolution essentially 329ratio 1440p but with a better pixel density than the typical 219 3440x1440 and is DisplayHDR True Black 400 certified. It also has a fasterthanAlienware 240Hz refresh rate and incorporates Samsungs Gaming Hub for cloud gaming. Samsung opted to go with mini DisplayPort instead of fullsize DisplayPort for this model in addition to HDMI and USBC with 65watt power delivery. Samsung expects to ship it later this year and has yet to give us pricing. A little more mundane if you consider 43inch monitors have reached that level of commonplace the flat Odyssey Neo G7 goes a little sleeker and more gamingslashentertainment hybrid than its predecessors. The 144Hz Quantum Dot DisplayHDR 600compliant monitor has integrated stereo speakers and comes with a remote and all the streamingandgaming apps Samsungs Hubs can include.

Th…",https://gizmodo.com/razer-blade-16-4k-high-fps-mini-led-nvidia-rtx-price-1849952313,Normally when you buy a gaming laptop you have to make a choice. Do you want a high resolution for pretty visuals or a high frame rate for smooth gameplay Most of the time you can only choose one with some middle ground in the 1440p and 120Hz area. The new Razer Blade 16 with its dualmode miniLED display is getting rid of that choice for you. The laptop which launches in Q1 of this year for a not insignificant starting price of 2699 is at least doing its best to keep you from getting buyers remorse. Regardless of the model you pick youll be able to press a button to swap the display between Creator Mode and a Gamer Mode. The Creator Mode swaps your laptop over to a 4K resolution The representing the small number of extra pixels it has to hit its 1610 aspect ratio with a 120Hz refresh rate while the Gamer Mode sets your laptop to an FHD resolution with a 240Hz refresh rate. Your current laptop can swap resolutions and potentially even refresh rates yes. But most 4K laptops dont have the option to hit refresh rates as high as 240Hz even if you lower the resolution. The panel focusing on supporting 4K just cant do that. Now giving yourself the option of fidelity doesnt preclude you from hitting a high fps when youd prefer to lower the quality in exchange for extra smooth animation. Razer hasnt been entirely clear with me about how this works and I assume Ill get more details on that closer to launch as well as an opportunity to test it out myself. What I do know now is that the laptops poised to be as powerful as youd expect from Razer with Intel Core HX CPUs and Nvidias new mobile GPUs. Anecdotally I played a racing sim at a meeting with Nvidia at CES that ran three 4K displays off a single RTX 4090 Razer Blade 16 and I easily would have thought I was playing off a desktop if I hadnt known. I also saw Cyberpunk 2077 running at 121 fps on an RTX 4070 Ti Razer Blade 16 with its power artificially restricted to 30 less than what a neighboring RTX 3090 Ti equipped system was pullingsaid system was only hitting 80 fps. Its always wise to take such demos with a grain of salt since theyre specifically tailored to show the systems in their best lights and may not take them through the most demanding tasks. Were excited to review this system later this year.,2023-01-05T18:00:00Z,Acer's Newest Gaming Laptops Have Huge 16- and 18-inch Display Options,Extremely Positive,0,[],[],[]
22,Asus Gaming Laptops Overwhelm with 2023 Updates - CNET,Even the most basic refreshes announced at CES have some useful enhancements.,https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/asus-gaming-laptops-overwhelm-with-2023-updates/,Asus CES gaming laptop announcements seem to touch every single model in its portfolio and include 2023s biggest gaming hardware trend so far an 18inch gaming laptop. Yes there are also the usual everythingisupdatedto2023generation components like Intel 13thgen H and HXseries processors and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40series GPUs as well as nextgen AMD CPUs and GPUs which were expecting to hear about during the keynote on Wednesday night Jan. 4. The company has announced a couple of interesting gaming monitors as well. Screen updates abound there are lots of 240Hz 1440p displays with smaller bezels and 1610 aspect ratios which youll see everywhere in gaming laptops and youll see 15 and 17inch models swapped out for 16 and 18inch ones which is another big trend at the show. The actual physical redesigns are modest so dont look for an allver new look just new components and features. Optimized for Optimus My fave new feature is the rollout of Nvidia Advanced Optimus support across all Asus gaming laptops with Nvidia GPUs or at least most of them. Thats the technology that enables the laptop screen to switch between operating on the discrete GPU or the integrated GPU without forcing you to reboot and which finally lets the laptop display use GSync. Its potentially a big energy efficiency and battery life saver. Asus ROG Nebula HDR displays available on the Zephyrus M16 Zephyrus G14 Strix Scar 16 and Flow X16 have double the mini LED backlight zones 1024. Theyre DisplayHDR 1000compliant screens with a peak brightness of 1100 nits. They have larger heatsinks too because that level of brightness can get hot. As mentioned above theyre 1440p 240Hz plus 100 P3 gamut coverage. One exception is the Nebula HDR screen in the Zephyrus G14 which is a dimmer DisplayHDR 600. The 3ms pixel refresh isnt stellar though. Asus also has an external GPU box called the XG Mobile. It works with systems like the 13inch Flow X13 and Flow Z13 laptops and the 16inch Flow X16 adding extra graphics power. That XG Mobile previously contained an Nvidia RTX 3080 GPU and this year itll get bumped up to a newer 40series RTX GPU. Thatll help this expensive addon feel like a better longterm investment. AMD isnt getting left out. theres a new model that highlights all the latest and greatest technology on offer from that company called the TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition. Its one of the few laptops incorporating an AMD GPU which is up to generation RDNA 3 this year. Sadly the MUX switch a clunky way to toggle between the discrete and integrated GPU lives on here. Its not as elegant a solution as Optimus nor does it have Thunderbolt 4 support it does have USB 4 because thats still an Intel thing. There are a few other AMD CPUbased models as well and several of the new gaming laptops including the 16inch Zephyrus models have newer sixspeaker arrays. Perhaps more importantly many of the ROG offerings have been finally upgraded to 1080p webcams which is something we should expect from every laptop now.

Lets get all the nitty gritty out the way first. By now you should be familiar with Nvidias rebranding switch from RTX 4080 to RTX 4070 Ti. The card as such features the AD104 GPU and specs between all three MSI variants remain largely the same save for boost frequencies. The most frugal GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU to date carries a 285W TDP all powered through a single 16pin cable and should be ideal for powerefficient builds requiring only a recommended 600W PSU. Back onto clock speeds for the interim the base clock remains the same across all MSI cards at 2310MHz rising to 2625MHz for the Ventus 3X 2760MHz for Gaming X Trio and 2790Mhz for Suprim X. 12GB of GDDR6X is attached via a 192bit memory bus and clocked at a default 21Gbps resulting in 504GBs bandwidth. Suprim Series MSIs most premium model the Suprim is synonymous for its geometric design cues featuring brushed aluminium on the exterior and an armourlike aesthetic that envelops both the front and rear back plate. This often makes it a highly sought after card due to its more mature and modern appeal. Subtle RGB accent lighting is present on the face ideal for those who love a vertically mounted graphics card and those choosing a more traditional installation will be greeted to an RGBemblazoned MSI logo and text alongside the obligatory GeForce RTX branding. All customisable through Mystic Light of course. Though lavishly constructed Suprim is undoubtedly a thicc boi measuring threeandahalf slots wide. The cooler features seven core heat pipes that run through a massive nickelplated heatsink and copper baseplate and at first glance dimensions appear similar to 4080 and 4090 models. Gaming Trio Series Opting for a if it aint broke dont fix it approach this looks eerily similar to the previous renditions of MSIs Gaming Trio Series save for a few subtle changes that you would most likely miss if it wasnt pointed out. You can expect the same excellent cooling performance except the nickel plated heatsink now houses six heatpipes instead of the aforementioned seven when compared to its Suprim sibling. The overall design is best suited for a more gamer aesthetic featuring a trio of RGB accent lights slashed across the centred fan that give it an edgy appeal without feeling over done. As before Mystic Lighting handles all the exterior RGB lighting to ensure synchronicity with all you RGBinfused components. Ventus Series At the bottom of the stack where RTX 4070 Ti makes most sense the Ventus is well known for its budgetfriendly approach. Delivering a nothrills card its the closest to stock in terms of specs and thats not necessarily a bad thing considering the fact that the Ventus measures in at 2. 5 slots in terms of width which makes it an ideal card for compact builds. Theres no RGB accent lighting though some would see that as a plus and the trio of fans are from the previously used Torx Fan 4. 0 design whereas both the Suprim and Gaming Trio use updated Torx Fan 5. 0 variants which MSI touts as having improved airflow and static air pressure capabilities. Finally while the Gaming X Trio and Suprim X cards come kitted with a dual BIOS for silent and gaming mode operations the Ventus ships with a single BIOS as standard. It doesnt look nearly as impressive as its siblings but pricing ought to be much closer to MSRP. The trio of MSI cards are expected to be available starting January 5 with a suggested retail price of from 799. All eyes are now on retailers to see which cards if any manage to hit that target.,2023-01-04T16:30:00Z,Asus Joins the 18-inch Gaming Laptop Club,Extremely Positive,50,"['Scar', 'dimmer', 'bumped', 'expensive', 'Sadly', 'clunky']",[],[]
24,It feels like Nvidia is gaslighting us with this ‘new’ GPU,Nvidia doesn't want you to remember that the RTX 4070 Ti isn't really a newly announced GPU.,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-relaunch-feels-like-gaslighting/,Nvidia announced a new GPU dubbed the RTX 4070 Ti via its broadcast ahead of CES 2023. Why the quotations around new you ask Well its not a new GPU at all actually but youd never know it by the way Nvidia GeForce head Jeff Fisher just talked about it. If you werent paying close attention to tech media news for the past few months youd think this was Nvidias fourth GPU in the new RTX 40series but no. Its just a new name for a product that was announced last year and then quickly retracted. In October of last year Nvidia did something unheard of in the tech industry. It unlaunched a recently announced product the RTX 4080 12GB. And that was Nvidias own language not mine mentioned in a quiet blog post with a total of five sentences most of which was spent on talking up the hype around the RTX 4090. And then the rumors starting building that the GPU would get rebranded as the RTX 4070 Ti which Nvidia seems to think would fix all the problems with this overpriced graphics card. Not only does it not magically make this thing a good value even at 100 cheaper but Nvidia just completely skipped over the fact that the RTX 4070 Ti is really just a rebrand. Again if you were watching this broadcast and perhaps missed the news about the unlaunch youd have no idea that this wasnt a brand new graphics card. Its like Nvidia wants us to just forget that all that unlaunching business ever happened or that it announced a GPU called the RTX 4080 12GB that just now materialized with a new name. Rather than come clean about what this new GPU really is Nvidia is trying to do mind wipe. It would have been great chance to poke fun at itself or just be honest about what exactly happened. Why not admit that the change was in response to feedback Tech enthusiasts and PC gamers love to hear that their opinions are heard. But no. Nvidia wants to play it cool and pretend like it didnt totally flub this product launch. At a time when its RTX 40series GPUs already have a pretty bad reputation gaslighting us wasnt the wisest choice here.

25,Nvidia brings the mighty RTX 4090 to laptops at CES 2023,"Laptop gamers, get ready -- Nvidia has just announced the upcoming release of its RTX 40-series mobile graphics cards.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-announces-rtx-40-mobile-gpus/,In huge news for laptop gamers Nvidias RTX 40series is coming to laptops and despite previous expectations the new lineup includes something for everyone. During its CES 2023 keynote Nvidia revealed that the full range of RTX 4000 cards is coming out. The list includes the RTX 4090 RTX 4080 RTX 4070 RTX 4060 and even the budget RTX 4050. Heres everything we know about Nvidias new laptop arsenal. Following the successful launch of the RTX 4090 and the RTX 4080 in 2022 Nvidia is now ready to reveal the mobile RTX 40 Ada lineup alongside the desktop RTX 4070 Ti. The company is trying a different strategy this time around because its set to cover a wider range of budgets with its mobile graphics cards. Nvidia splits its lineup into two sections mainstream and flagship. The RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 mobile both belong to the flagship sector. Nvidia promises 60 frames per second fps surround gaming at 4K the capability of 3D collaboration at seamless In the previous generation of This is most likely going to be one beefy GPU and were expecting to find it paired with the upcoming Intel Raptor Lake mobile flagship that powers some of the best gaming laptops of the year. Next we have the mobile version of the RTX 4080. Weve recently seen it in a leaked benchmark and it destroyed the competition winning by 42 when compared to its predecessor the RTX 3080M. This model is equipped with 7424 CUDA cores 12GB of memory and a maximum boost clock of 2. 28GHz. The mainstream Lastly we have the RTX 4060 and the RTX 4050 which are set to appear in more budgetfriendly laptop models. The specifications of the RTX 4060 include 3072 CUDA cores clock speeds of up to 2370MHz and 8GB of GDDR6 memory while the RTX 4050 comes with 2560 CUDA cores the same maximum clock speed and 6GB of GDDR6 VRAM. When it comes to the mainstream sector Nvidia zones in on the performance per watt promising to deliver the performance of the RTX 3080 at onethird of the power cost. The Instead of the staggered release approach that Nvidia took with its desktop lineup the RTX 40series Nvidia said that the flagship RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 will arrive first on February 8 with a price tag of at least 1999. The RTX 4070 RTX 4060 and RTX 4050 will begin showing up in In addition to mobile GPUs Nvidia revealed new desktop GPUs a new GeForce Now tier and more.

26,CES 2023: Nvidia GeForce Now is coming to internet-enabled cars,"You'll soon be able to stream and play Nvidia GeForce now games like Rocket League in select, internet-enabled cars.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/nvidia-geforce-now-cars-ces-2023/,Nvidia GeForce Now is coming to an unexpected new platform cars. The cloud streaming service will start rolling out in select internetenabled vehicles with three partners announced during Nvidias CES 2023 showcase. GeForce Now is a popular gaming subscription service that allows players to stream games from the cloud. Nvidia expanded the services functionality and reach over the past few years even bringing it to Samsung smart TVs as a native app. The services latest expansion will take the service to the open road. A video accompanying the announcement shows a driver loading up the GeForce Now app via a screen in a car clicking on Rocket League and playing it with a connected gamepad. Nvidia notes that no special equipment is required to get the service running in a vehicle. Three partners will add GeForce Now to their vehicles to start BYD Hyundai Motor Group and Polestar. All three companies are currently working on integrating the service with no other partners named. The move is part of Nvidias vision of the future which it predicts will see car interiors turning into mobile living spaces. The company is careful to note how it expects drivers to play in the car though noting that it sees games being played while an electric car charges or while waiting to pick up a family member. The video also shows kids playing Rocket League on backseat screens during a drive which is perhaps the more practical use case. Nvidia isnt the only company looking to bring games to cars. Tesla recently gave drivers the ability to play Steam games inside of their vehicles.

31,The first RTX 4070 Ti preorders confirm our worst fears,"We've just received our first reports of an Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti graphics card being found for sale. Unfortunately, it's not great news.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-found-for-sale/,Nvidias GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is rumored to be coming out soon and some retailers across the globe have jumped the gun and started putting it up for sale ahead of time. This time the GPU was spotted at a Chinese retailer in two custom versions. These early listings provide us with the first hints as to the pricing of the RTX 4070 Ti. Unfortunately they only serve to confirm what weve already feared the GPU might be just as expensive as the RTX 4090 and the RTX 4080. Leaked images of the RTX 4070 Ti appeared on Baidu a Chinese website and were later shared by Wccftech. The photos show us two custom versions of the card both made by MSI the MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Gaming X and the RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 3X. Each has a slightly different price tag but both of those price tags are not great. The Ventus 3X is priced at 7199 RMB which translates to around 1034 while the Gaming X costs 7599 RMB 1092. This puts these cards just slightly south of the recommended price for the RTX 4080 which is of course quite ridiculous. However its important to note that these prices are likely different from what Nvidia will set as the MSRP for the RTX 4070 Ti. For one were dealing with two custom versions of the card and MSI is known for making some of the more highend models. Theyll have slightly better specs than the Founders Edition but theyll also cost more. Another thing to consider is that there are added taxes so this might be the price on the Chinese market but it doesnt necessarily mean that the U. S. market will receive the same treatment. In all likelihood it will be cheaper in the United States than it seems to be in China. On the other hand seeing an almost 1100 list price in China suggests that it still wont exactly be cheap. The RTX 4090 and the RTX 4080 are both expensive and so far all signs point to Nvidia continuing that trend. A price in the ballpark of 800 to 900 seems quite likely. Rumors say that the RTX 4070 Ti will be equipped with the full AD104400 GPU featuring 7680 CUDA cores. Other specs include a clock speed of 2610MHz likely higher for custom versions 48MB of L2 cache and up to 12GB of GDDR6X memory across a 192bit bus. The memory is supposed to be running at 21Gbps meaning a bandwidth of 504GBs. The RTX 4070 Ti keeps the power requirements fairly mild. With a TBP of 285 watts its set to consume less power than both the RTX 3080 10GB and the RTX 3070 Ti albeit very slightly 35 watts for the 3080 and 5 watts for the 3070 Ti. Performancewise the RTX 4070 Ti is said to be trailing far behind the RTX 4080 which is why its important that its not too expensive. If its priced correctly it could still become one of the best graphics cards for more balanced builds. Nvidia might shed more light on the matter during CES 2023.

32,The Worst Hacks of 2022,"The year was marked by sinister new twists on cybersecurity classics, including phishing, breaches, and ransomware attacks.",https://www.wired.com/story/worst-hacks-2022/,With the pandemic evolving into an amorphous new phase and political polarization on the rise around the world 2022 was an uneasy and often perplexing year in digital security. And while hackers frequently leaned on old chestnuts like phishing and ransomware attacks they still found vicious new variations to subvert defenses. Heres WIREDs look back on the years worst breaches leaks ransomware attacks statesponsored hacking campaigns and digital takeovers. If the first years of the 2020s are any indication the digital security field in 2023 will be more bizarre and unpredictable than ever. Stay alert and stay safe out there. For years Russia has pummeled Ukraine with brutal digital attacks causing blackouts stealing and destroying data meddling in elections and releasing destructive malware to ravage the countrys networks. Since invading Ukraine in February though times have changed for some of Russias most prominent and most dangerous military hackers. Shrewd longterm campaigns and grimly ingenious hacks have largely given way to a stricter and more regimented clip of quick intrusions into Ukrainian institutions reconnaissance and widespread destruction on the networkand then repeated access over and over again whether through a new breach or by maintaining the old access. The Russian playbook on the physical battlefield and in cyberspace seems to be the same one of ferocious bombardment that projects might and causes as much pain as possible to the Ukrainian government and its citizens. Ukraine has not been digitally passive during the war though. The country formed a volunteer IT Army after the invasion and it along with other actors around the world have mounted DDoS attacks disruptive hacks and data breaches against Russian organizations and services. Over the summer a group of researchers dubbed 0ktapus also sometimes known as Scatter Swine went on a massive phishing bender compromising nearly 10000 accounts within more than 130 organizations. The majority of the victim institutions were USbased but there were dozens in other countries as well according to researchers. The attackers primarily texted targets with malicious links that led to fake authentication pages for the identity management platform Okta which can be used as a single signon tool for numerous digital accounts. The hackers goal was to steal Okta credentials and twofactor authentication codes so they could get access to a number of accounts and services at once. One company hit during the rampage was the communications firm Twilio. It suffered a breach at the beginning of August that affected 163 of its customer organizations. Twilio is a big company so that only amounted to 0. 06 percent of its clients but sensitive services like the secure messaging app Signal twofactor authentication app Authy and authentication firm Okta were all in that slice and became secondary victims of the breach. Since one of the services Twilio offers is a platform for automatically sending out SMS text messages one of the knockon effects of the incident was that attackers were able to compromise twofactor authentication codes and breach the user accounts of some Twilio customers. As if that wasnt enough Twilio added in an October report that it was also breached by 0ktapus in June and that the hackers stole customer contact information. The incident highlights the true power and menace of phishing when attackers choose their targets strategically to magnify the effects. Twilio wrote in August we are very disappointed and frustrated about this incident. In recent years countries around the world and the cybersecurity industry have increasingly focused on countering ransomware attacks. While there has been some progress on deterrence ransomware gangs were still on a rampage in 2022 and continued to target vulnerable and vital social institutions including health care providers and schools. The Russianspeaking group Vice Society for example has long specialized in targeting both categories and it focused its attacks on the education sector this year. The group had a particularly memorable showdown with the Los Angeles Unified School District at the beginning of September in which the school ultimately took a stand and refused to pay the attackers even as its digital networks went down. LAUSD was a highprofile target and Vice Society may have bitten off more than it could chew given that the system includes more than 1000 schools serving roughly 600000 students. Meanwhile in November the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency the FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services released a joint warning about the Russialinked ransomware group and malware maker known as HIVE. The agencies said the groups ransomware has been used to target over 1300 organizations around the world resulting in roughly 100 million in ransom payments from victims. From June 2021 through at least November 2022 threat actors have used Hive ransomware to target a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure sectors the agencies wrote including Government Facilities Communications Critical Manufacturing Information Technology and especially Healthcare and Public Health. The digital extortion gang Lapsus was on an intense hacking spree at the beginning of 2022 stealing source code and other sensitive information from companies like Nvidia Samsung Ubisoft and Microsoft and then leaking samples as part of apparent extortion attempts. Lapsus has a sinister talent for phishing and in March it compromised a contractor with access to the ubiquitous authentication service Okta. The attackers appeared to be based primarily in the United Kingdom and at the end of March British police arrested seven people in association with the group and charged two at the beginning of April. In September though the group flared back to life mercilessly breaching the rideshare platform Uber and seemingly the Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar as well. On September 23 police in the UK said they had arrested an unnamed 17yearold in Oxfordshire who seems to be one of the individuals previously arrested in March in connection with Lapsus. The beleaguered password manager giant LastPass which has repeatedly dealt with data breaches and security incidents over the years said at the end of December that a breach of its cloud storage in August led to a further incident in which hackers targeted a LastPass employee to compromise credentials and cloud storage keys. The attackers then used this access to steal some users encrypted password vaultsthe files that contain customers passwordsand other sensitive data. Additionally the company says that some source code and technical information were stolen from our development environment during the August incident. LastPass CEO Karim Toubba said in a blog post that in the later attacks hackers compromised a copy of a backup that contained customer password vaults. It is not clear when the backup was made. The data is stored in a proprietary binary format and contains both unencrypted data like website URLs and encrypted data like usernames and passwords. The company did not provide technical details about the proprietary format. Even if LastPasss vault encryption is strong hackers will attempt to bruteforce their way into the password troves by attempting to guess the master passwords that users set to protect their data. With a strong master password this may not be possible but weak master passwords could be at risk of being defeated. And since the vaults have already been stolen LastPass users cant stop these bruteforce attacks by changing their master password. Users should instead confirm that they have deployed twofactor authentication on as many of their accounts as they can so even if their passwords are compromised attackers still cant break in. And LastPass customers should consider changing the passwords on their most valuable and sensitive accounts.,2022-12-29T12:00:00Z,"

Do they have anything in common well presumably not This is where the realms of the design world make us believe in things unfathomable and outrightly defying logic. So how about a BMW Motorrad electric bike powered by NVIDIA guts Designer Aaryaman Mistry Just like youd have the freedom to upgrade your PC with a new GPU or other hardware the idea of swapping old motorbike parts with a new one sounds adventurous. Aaryman has created an NVIDIApowered architecture for electric motorcycles of the future that caught my attention. Of course the level of standardization for each of those parts will be a herculean task on its own and whether or not all automotive manufacturers will comply with the idea is still a looming query. If hypothetically everything goes to plan the scope for modularity personalization and upgradability will be immense. Users can reflect their personality with custom parts and even 3D print those parts or buy them. When these parts have served the purpose they can be swapped with newer components rather than changing the electric twowheeler. Just like on this BMW x NVIDIA bike with the option to swap battery console saddle microchip or body frame components. A good example is toggling the handlebar section for racing or city riding configuration. This will give motorbike enthusiasts the flexibility of having different twowheelers for a specific purpose without having to buy a new one. The swapping will be effortless and as easy as changing a toddlers diaper. The bikes core houses the advanced GPU and CPU which can adapt to the ides current configuration. There are highend cooling systems by NVIDIA that keep the electric battery at the optimum operating temperature for peak performance. Everything about this bike seems very balanced without any overpowering elements while maintaining a scifi persona of a highly agile set of wheels. The designer has opted for a mix of familiar BMW Motorrad aesthetics and colors fused with the geeky look of NVIDIApowered PCs.,2023-01-12T23:30:55Z,The Worst Hacks of 2022,Extremely Negative,1000,"['uneasy', 'perplexing', 'attacks', 'vicious', 'subvert', 'worst', 'leaks', 'attacks', 'bizarre', 'unpredictable', 'brutal', 'attacks', 'stealing', 'destructive', 'ravage', 'dangerous', 'hacks', 'destruction', 'breach', 'bombardment', 'pain', 'passive', 'attacks', 'disruptive', 'hacks', 'malicious', 'fake', 'steal', 'rampage', 'suffered', 'breach', 'breach', 'breach', 'stole', 'menace', 'disappointed', 'frustrated', 'attacks', 'rampage', 'vulnerable', 'Vice', 'attacks', 'showdown', 'refused', 'Vice', 'warning', 'threat', 'critical', 'Critical', 'extortion', 'intense', 'stealing', 'leaking', 'extortion', 'mercilessly', 'breach', 'steal', 'stolen', 'attacks', 'proprietary', 'proprietary', 'weak', 'risk', 'stolen', 'attacks', 'break']",[],"['lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', Karim, Toubba]"

Out tomorrow January 5th at a starting price of 799 799 Nvidia say its faster than their previous flagship the RTX 3090 Ti and will max out 1440p monitors. In terms of specs youre looking at 12GB of GDDR6X memory a boost clock speed of 2. 61GHz 7680 CUDA cores as well as DLSS 3 support. Its power usage also sits at 285W but Nvidia recommend you pair it with a 700W PSU. Of course if youve been following the drama over Nvidias cancelled 12GB RTX 4080 graphics card those specs will all look intimately familiar and thats because they are. Theyre exactly the same as that cancelled RTX 4080 variant suggesting that Nvidia have indeed just rebadged the unlaunched GPU as the RTX 4070 Ti. To briefly recap said drama the 12GB RTX 4080 was originally meant to launch alongside its 16GB sibling the RTX 4080 proper on November 16th last year. But Nvidia ended up cancelling the card about a month before it was meant to release citing that its not named right and that having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing so in the bin it went. Or so we thought. Instead its seemingly now resurfaced as the RTX 4070 Ti which is more or less what hardware editor James expected theyd do at the end of last year. The main upshot of this slightly protracted renaming process is that the resulting RTX 4070 Ti is now quite a bit cheaper than what it was going to be originally with partner cards starting at 799 799. Dont get me wrong thats still a sizable chunk of change but it is at least a smidge better than the 12GB RTX 4080s proposed launch price of 949 899 which is a particularly good turn out for us folks in the UK I might add. Hardware ed James will no doubt be putting the RTX 4070 Ti through its paces very soon so youll be able to see whether its worth the money in the coming weeks. If you dont want to wait for benchmarks to drop though youll hopefully be able to start putting orders in for RTX 4070 Ti cards tomorrow January 5th.,2023-01-04T11:56:09Z,BMW Motorrad x NVIDIA electric bike has swappable modules for flexibility of use,Extremely Positive,0,[],[],"[Aaryaman, Mistry, Aaryman]"

37,Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti review: not the GPU you’re looking for,"Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti is an interesting case study of how important branding and pricing are, but when it comes to raw numbers, it struggles to compete.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-review/,Better name and a better price but the RTX 4070 Ti still fails to impress. DLSS 3 Excellent thermal performance Solid value at 1440p and 1080p Poor performance at 4K Will likely sell above list price Nvidias RTX 4070 Ti was destined for controversy the moment Nvidia decided to unlaunch its 12GB RTX 4080. We dont have the RTX 4070 yet so an upgraded Ti version is an odd move so early in Nvidias RTX 40series generation and the spec sheet proves that the RTX 4070 Ti is just the 12GB RTX 4080 with a name adjustment. Nvidia is making a price adjustment to match knocking 100 off the announced list price of 900. However early preorders show that the card likely wont sell for that price and the performance isnt worthy of sitting alongside the best graphics cards. There are bright notes such as DLSS 3 and excellent thermal management but the RTX 4070 Ti suffers from high pricing and trailing raw performance. Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti specs The RTX 4070 Ti spec sheet confirms what most of the PC hardware world has suspected for a long time its a rebranded version of Nvidias illfated RTX 4080 12GB. The specs line up and the naming is incheck too. On top of that Nvidia cut the card down to a more fitting 800 list price. Youre getting 21 fewer CUDA cores compared to the RTX 4080 as well as 4GB less GDDR6X memory. Youre losing 21 of the Tensor and ray tracing cores of the RTX 4080 as well further illustrating that the RTX 4070 Ti should have never been in Nvidias xx80 class of graphics cards. Power also takes a dive to a manageable 285 watts which is a far cry from the TGP of the RTX 4090 at 450W. As Nvidias released Ada Lovelace GPUs have shown though the listed power draw is far from what youll typically see. These cards are efficient so they generally operate below maximum power even in highly demanding games. The 12GB of GDDR6X is squeezed through a 192bit bus vastly lowering the total memory bandwidth. The RTX 4070 Ti now has a more fitting name and a more fitting price. Its still 200 more expensive than the RTX 3070 Ti but thats far from the massive 500 upcharge of the RTX 4080. My only concern is the memory specification. It comes with 12GB of GDDR6X memory but thats squeezed through a 192bit bus vastly lowering the total memory bandwidth. Thats a problem the RTX 3060 from the previous generation experienced though with slower GDDR6 memory. In fact lastgens RTX 3070 Ti has around 40 more bandwidth than the RTX 4070 Ti. Memory bandwidth isnt everything and as youll see in my results below the RTX 4070 Ti still puts up a good fight. But higher resolutions stress memory bandwidth more and my results show the RTX 4070 Tis advantage at 1440p and 1080p start to diminish. Synthetic performance Before getting into real games I ran a couple of synthetic benchmarks to get a highlevel view of where the RTX 4070 Ti sits. Genongen youre looking at about a 44 improvement over the RTX 3070 Ti as well as a 13 lead over the RTX 3090. Thats mighty impressive considering the selling price of the RTX 3090 right now. If there are cards available at the list price of 800 on release day the RTX 4070 Ti destroys the value of lastgen options. The comparison with currentgen cards is different though. The RTX 4070 Ti is about 10 slower than the RX 7900 XT and 15 slower than the RX 7900 XTX. The RTX 4070 Ti is about 11 cheaper at list price but Nvidia isnt making a Founders Edition for this card. Board partner cards generally sell for above list price which puts the RTX 4070 Ti in a tough spot against AMDs current flagships. Ray tracing is where Nvidia shows a commanding lead but not with the RTX 4070 Ti. The RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 top the charts in 3DMarks Port Royal AMDs GPUs dont even come close. But the RTX 4070 Ti is only a mere 3 ahead of the RX 7900 XT and 5 behind the RX 7900 XTX. Synthetic benchmarks dont tell the full story though. In real games the RTX 4070 Ti is slightly lower than the synthetic results suggest overall. However certain titles really stress the memory bandwidth especially at 4K and make the RTX 4070 Ti seem much less impressive. 4K gaming Although Nvidia is billing the RTX 4070 Ti as a 1440p graphics card you expect some 4K gaming prowess when youre spending 800. The RTX 4070 Ti surpasses the fated 60 frames per second fps mark at 4K but its still quite a ways below the competition. Its a massive 20 slower than the RTX 4080 and compared to the RTX 4090 its 41 slower. Both those cards are far more expensive than the RTX 4070 Ti but Nvidias latest GPU fails to best even its direct competitors. Its 11 slower than the 900 RX 7900 XT and only a measly 4 faster than the RTX 3090. In some games like Horizon Zero Dawn the RTX 3090 is even a hair faster. The biggest competition comes from AMDs RX 6950 XT though. This lastgen GPU trades blows with the RTX 4070 Ti and its 50 to 100 cheaper at the time of writing. At 4K the RTX 4070 Ti is an inflection point for Nvidias Ada Lovelace generation. Were starting to reach performance levels of lastgen flagships with only minor differences in pricing. If 800 is your absolute limit the RTX 4070 Ti still wins out with better ray tracing and features like Deep Learning Super Sampling DLSS 3. In the opposite direction spending a bit more nets you much more performance putting the RTX 4070 Ti in a precarious spot at 4K. 1440p gaming Its no surprise that Nvidia is selling the RTX 4070 Ti as a 1440p graphics card because it looks a lot more impressive at that resolution. At 4K it trades blow with the RTX 3090 but at 1440p the RTX 4070 Ti is around 13 faster. Thats not a bad deal considering the RTX 3090 still sells for around 900 to 1000. The margins against AMDs latest GPUs tighten up too with the RTX 4070 Ti falling 8 short of the RX 7900 XT and 14 below the RX 7900 XTX. For generational improvements the RTX 4070 Ti is 40 faster than the RTX 3070 Ti but its also 33 more expensive. Performance should scale much higher than price but its not as bad as the RTX 4080 we recently saw. That card provided a 40 improvement over the previous generation with a 71 markup in price. On the other end though the RTX 4090 brought a 58 improvement for a minor 6 markup. The RTX 4070 Ti sits somewhere in between. Although the RTX 4070 Ti is more impressive at 1440p its not a showstopper. The RTX 3090 is still faster in games like Gears Tactics but the RTX 4070 Ti claims a small victory in Horizon Zero Dawn. On the other end the card dominates in Forza Horizon 5 matching the RTX 4080 and showing how out of sorts the pricing is with that card. My main reservation about the RTX 4080 is if well ever see any cards for 800. Nvidia isnt making a Founders Edition design and board partners tell me that overclocked models will go for around 100 more. The math changes a lot if the RTX 4070 Ti ends up selling for north of 900 where AMDs RX 7900 XT despite being a poor value on its own shows a commanding lead. 1080p gaming Jumping down to 1080p a clear gap between lastgen and currentgen offerings starts to emerge. CPU bottlenecks come into play with such powerful GPUs at a low resolution and the gaps between the most powerful GPUs shrink to no more than a dozen frames. Its not worth going into the individual results because frankly there are far better 1080p graphics cards on the market that are leagues cheaper than any in the chart above. Whats interesting here is how the RTX 4070 Ti performs compared to higher resolutions. Its 20 faster than the RTX 3090 8 slower than the RX 7900 XT and 11 behind the RX 7900 XTX. Those are very similar results as 1440p but far different than what I saw at 4K. Thats the narrow memory bus of the RTX 4070 Ti at play. As the resolution climbs the card starts showing its limitations. Its far more impressive at 1440p and 1080p but its hard to justify an 800 GPU for these resolutions when there are much cheaper options. Ray tracing and DLSS 3 Ray tracing is an area where Nvidia has claimed a dominating lead over AMD but the RTX 4070 Ti challenges that position. At 4K its barely faster than the RTX 3090 and RX 7900 XTX. Ray tracing performance was a major reason to go with Nvidia over AMD in the previous generation but the RTX 4070 Ti proves those margins are slipping. Once again though the RTX 4070 Tis limited memory bus is at play with a 4K resolution. Jumping down to 1440p the RTX 4070 Ti ends up 10 faster than the RX 7900 XTX and 19 faster than its closest currentgen competitor the RX 7900 XT. And at 1080p that gap widens even more with the RTX 4070 Ti starting to reach toward the RTX 4080 in ray tracing. The big question is how important ray tracing is for you. It can be a revolutionary piece of kit in games like Portal RTX but in a lot of titles ray tracing still represents a big performance loss for a minor visual gain. Nvidia still holds a lead in ray tracing but unlike the previous generation AMDs competing GPUs can hold their own. The major plus for the RTX 4070 Ti is support for DLSS 3. This upscaling tech includes a frame generation feature that can double and sometimes triple your frame rate in games. Its not perfect as you can see from the visual artifacts in Marvels SpiderMan Miles Morales above. However DLSS 3 is a huge benefit for high refresh rate gaming at 4K with ray tracing maxed out. Its only in a few games right now but Nvidia is rapidly rolling the feature out to new releases like Warhammer 40000 Darktide and Need for Speed Unbound. Temperatures and power Now that we have AMDs nextgen graphics cards as a basis for comparison Nvidias efficiency and temperature control in the Ada Lovelace generation becomes all the more impressive. Just like the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 the RTX 4070 Ti comes with a relatively highlisted TGP. Youll rarely hit its power limit though. Throughout my test suite the RTX 4070 Ti hovered around 200W to 230W occasionally dipping down to 150W at lower resolutions. The highest power I measured was 260W in Gears Tactics at 4K which is consistently the most powerhungry game in my test suite. The Asus Tuf Gaming models I reviewed stayed cool and quiet as well never going above 65 degrees Celsius. It often went lower between 55 and 60 degrees and that was with the Performance BIOS on Asus card. This particular card includes a dual BIOS so you can toggle it over to Quiet mode if you want. Based on my testing you dont need to. Performance is still king for a graphics card but the unsung advantage of the RTX 4070 Ti over a card like the RX 7900 XT is that it runs cooler quieter and more efficiently. For all of Nvidias Ada Lovelace GPUs I forget I have them installed because they just dont get very loud. The RTX 4070 Ti is no different. Not the GPU youre looking for Although there are positive points for the RTX 4070 Ti its still the rebranded RTX 4080 12GB without a major drop in price. 100 off is nothing to sneeze at but without a Founders Edition design and the expectation from board partners to sell a 900 GPU I dont see too many cards actually going for list price. The biggest competitor is oddly AMDs RX 7900 XT. That card isnt a great value but it looks a lot more enticing when stacked up against the RTX 4070 Ti. AMDs card is nearly 12 faster and although Nvidia still holds a slight edge in ray tracing its not the massive lead we saw in the previous generation. At 800 the RTX 4070 Ti is a solid if slightly overpriced GPU. It would be a smash success if you could find cards around 700. At 850 to 950 where I expect most cards to sell there are better options. The RTX 4070 Ti offers DLSS 3 at a more affordable price but you trade a decent amount of performance compared to the competition for that feature.

Some might think that only games and gamers actually benefit from advancements in this field but the proliferation of 2D and 3D digital art the push for the metaverse and even the booming industry of live streaming all depend on not only powerful but also accessible graphics. At the heart of all these is of course the graphics processing unit or GPU the dedicated piece of hardware that can make or break the graphics experience. Graphics cards especially those inside thin laptops are no longer just a luxury for gamers and NVIDIAs latest GeForce RTX 40 Series is demonstrating how these same technologies presumed to be just for gamers are also essential in supporting the sophisticated needs and workflows of todays creators. Designer NVIDIA Announced a few months ago NVIDIAs GeForce RTX 40 family is built on the companys new Ada Lovelace architecture that as you might expect pushes the envelope in terms of graphics performance while balancing thermal and power efficiency. The graphics giants CES 2023 address was naturally filled with the technical terms and buzzwords that both gamers and game developers drool over including the nextgen AIpowered ray tracing technology DLSS3. These very same features however support more than just the consumption of content but more importantly empower creators with new tools to bring their ideas and imagination to life. The GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards naturally make apps run more smoothly and fluidly particularly those that depend heavily on graphics performance such as Blender and Photoshop. NVIDIAs graphics cards also include a tiny supercomputer inside for machine learning and AI and this power also boosts the performance of AIbased tools like image generation realtime avatar control and other neat features like Eye Focus which remaps your eye so that it seems like youre always looking straight at the camera. NVIDIA also presents its Omniverse platform and a suite of new tools in its NVIDIA Studio that allow creators to collaborate on a single project from different parts of the world using different tools. Whether its creating 3D animation or 2D art NVIDIAs latest generation of graphics cards provides the power and intelligence to make it happen. Of course all that power would remain unused unless it landed in the hands of the creators it was made for. Taking aim at the growing trend of 14inch laptops NVIDIA is bringing the GeForce RTX 40 family to a wide variety of laptops from different brands some starting as low as 999. By bringing this technology in a more portable and accessible form NVIDIA is empowering creators designers gamers and live streamers to dream big and go big bringing their ideas to life and making this world a more vibrant and lively place.,2023-01-03T17:30:09Z,No-one's buying (new) graphics cards,Extremely Negative,210,"['crashed', 'bad']",[],[]
43,NVIDIA GeForce Now gaining RTX 4080 support and coming to cars,"During CES 2023, NVIDIA announced that the new Ultimate tier of its GeForce Now service will be powered by the RTX 4080 GPU, and the service is also heading to cars.",https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/nvidia-geforce-now-gaining-rtx-4080-support-and-coming-to-cars,NVIDIA GeForce Now gaining RTX 4080 support and coming to cars NVIDIAs GeForce Now cloud gaming service is getting more powerful and coming to more places. What you need to know NVIDIA GeForce Now is a cloud gaming service powered by NVIDIAs highend RTX GPUs. During CES 2023 NVIDIA announced that GeForce Nows Ultimate tier will be moving to the RTX 4080 platform. This means support for up to 240 FPS while streaming games with DLSS 3 and full RTX raytraced visuals. NVIDIA is also working with car manufacturers like Hyundai and Polestar to bring GeForce Now to cars. Cloud gaming is an excellent way to game wherever you are and NVIDIAs GeForce Now is one of the most impressive services currently available. Powered by NVIDIAs industryleading RTX GPUs GeForce Now lets users stream well over a thousand different games and its about to get a major performance upgrade and become available in new places. Announced by NVIDIA during CES 2023 GeForce Now is making the jump to the immensely capable NVIDIA RTX 4080 GPU allowing players subscribed to the services most premium Ultimate tier to take advantage of the latest NVIDIA technologies. With the 4080 in tow players will be able to stream games at the highest settings up to a staggering 240 FPS with DLSS 3 and fullfledged RTX raytracing on board. NVIDIA is promising improved visuals and reduced latency with the introduction of the RTX 4080. GeForce Now is also gaining framepacing technology when used in its 240 FPS mode allowing varied streaming rates to further reduce input latency. NVIDIA GeForce Now gained support for up to 120 FPS in Aug. 2022 and its already upping the ante significantly alongside its major power boost. The Ultimate tier which is 19. 99 a month or 99. 99 every six months is already powered by the stillimpressive RTX 3080. Current subscribers will be upgraded to the RTX 4080powered servers when they become available starting later this month in North America and Europe. In other news GeForce Now will also become available in more places as NVIDIA is partnering with several car manufacturers to bring the cloud gaming service to your vehicle. Hyundai which also owns the Kia and Genesis brands and Polestar will count among the first manufacturers to include NVIDIA GeForce Now in their vehicles allowing users to stream hundreds of their favorite PC games when away from home and presumably when at a stop. Windows Central take Making cloud gaming better and more accessible I recently wrote about how I finally believe in the dream of Xbox Cloud Gaming after reviewing one of the first cloud gamingfocused devices in the Logitech G Cloud which also supports NVIDIA GeForce Now. Im interested in seeing the space continue to evolve and NVIDIA certainly has one of the most interesting solutions. Rather than paying for a service that provides the games over the cloud NVIDIA lets you stream the games you already own on Steam the Epic Games Store GOG and more via its own servers. This is how GeForce Now supports over 1500 PC games including some of the most popular titles in the world and can stream those games at the very best settings as the NVIDIA RTX 4080 is significantly more powerful than any console including the Xbox Series X. Its great to see NVIDIA invest more into GeForce Now and for the service to already begin supporting the companys latest generation of gaming technologies. Im a little more dubious about the usefulness of cloud gaming in vehicles but NVIDIA isnt the first to attempt this. Teslas recently gained the ability to play Steam games and Windows Centrals Sean Endicott believes that the feature isnt as stupid as it may seem at first glance. Either way Ill be interested to see if GeForce Now in vehicles is what the service needs to really hit the mainstream.

44,NVIDIA upgrading GeForce Now in 2023 — RTX 4080 GPUs bring 4K gaming and more,NVIDIA is upgrading its cloud-gaming GeForce Now service with RTX 4080 GPUs for faster response times and higher-quality visuals.,https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/nvidia-upgrading-geforce-now-2023-rtx-4080-and-more,NVIDIA upgrading GeForce Now in 2023 RTX 4080 GPUs bring 4K gaming and more GeForce Now boasts 120Hz ultrawide gaming and a new membership tier. What you need to know NVIDIA is upgrading its cloudgaming GeForce Now service with RTX 4080 GPUs for faster response times and higherquality visuals. New SuperPOD servers are powered by the Ada Lovelace architecture supporting all visual enhancements provided by NVIDIA RTX. A new Ultimate membership tier will include the latest upgrades including up to 4K resolutions at 120 FPS with NVIDIA Reflex support for low latency input response. NVIDIA made waves at CES 2023 in Las Vegas by announcing a series of incoming upgrades to its cloudgaming GeForce now service. Current RTX 3080 membership subscribers will see their account upgraded to a new tier and newcomers will have opportunities to access the service for free with bundle deals from NVIDIA partners. Product manager Andrew Fear gave us a briefing to describe their plans for GeForce now over the year ahead including new features and support for upcoming devices. Acrosstheboard improvements to its service promise exciting times ahead for cloud gaming. Region expansion As of January 2023 NVIDIA reports that over 25 million users have tried the GeForce Now service. Moving into the year ahead its cloud platform is available in over 100 countries with more planned for expansion until all hemispheres are covered so that the sun never sets on GeForce Now. GeForce Now is supported by 30 data centers arranged across the globe by NVIDIA and its partners with three new operations including coverage for Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan by GFN. AM Malaysia by YTL and South Africa by Rain. Plans for upcoming regions havent been confirmed but NVIDIA seems determined in its aim for expansion. RTX 4080 in the SuperPOD One of the most significant announcements from NVIDIA at CES 2023 regarding GeForce Now was unveiling its SuperPOD cloud gaming supercomputers powered by the RTX 4080 GPU and the Ada Lovelace architecture within. These hefty servers are exclusively designed for gaming providing over 64 TFLOPs of processing power in the cloud 1. 7x faster than the current service using RTX 3080 GPUs. Supporting the RTX 4080 for GeForce Now brings more RTX goodies including complete ray tracing and DLSS 3 support for improved visuals with AV1 encoding saving around 15 bandwidth compared to H. 265. The flexible encoder is part of NVIDIAs aim to bring cloud gaming as close to desktop gaming as possible with sidebyside demonstrations at CES exhibiting how that is becoming a reality. RTX 4080 SuperPOD servers also support NVIDIA Reflex 240Hz in competitive mode reducing input latency to around 35ms when using a typical 120Hz TV in testing. Currentgeneration RTX 3080 systems for GeForce Now perform at about 60ms close to the average Xbox Series X output latency at 120Hz so anything less is a win for cloud gaming. Increasing to 240 FPS for rendering with NVIDIA Reflex frame pacing tech helps the cloudbased GPU process inputs from the user and respond with lowlatency visuals as fast as possible. Any titles with Reflex support should be more responsive on GeForce Now with the incoming upgrades depending on your membership level. New devices and features Working alongside manufacturers developing hardware specifically designed for cloud gaming NVIDIA is expanding its range of GeForce Now games with support for touch screens. Describing companies including Razer and Logitech as those who believe in the cloud NVIDIA demonstrated its new category additions to the cloud gaming library when launched on touchscreen devices. Titles with native touchscreen support including Genshin Impact will appear in a dedicated section alongside others designed for a natural experience whether or not you use a joypad attachment on mobile or tablets. Games with recent RTX enhancements will see similar publicity on GeForce Now including Fortnite for highend visuals over the cloud. Cloud gaming hardware is set to make waves this year with our Logitech G Cloud review proving that some of the only drawbacks are region restrictions which NVIDIA is actively working against. Upcoming Chromebook laptops from Acer ASUS and Lenovo will officially support GeForce Now. They offer a versatile and affordable method of accessing the platform alongside their cloudbased operating system. NVIDIAs product manager Andrew Fear confirmed that while a native GeForce Now application isnt available for Steam Deck they are looking to do more with it in 2023. Ultimate membership The new GeForce Now Ultimate membership tier was another huge announcement for NVIDIA at CES 2023 upgrading any existing RTX 3080 members. Starting in Q1 2023 these users will automatically be moved to the new RTX 4080 SuperPOD servers powered by Ada Lovelace but the subscription price is not planned to change. Alongside the improvements to this highend service including 4K resolution at 120 FPS and NVIDIA Reflex 240Hz Competitive mode support is support for ultrawide screens streaming up to 3840x1600 resolutions at 120Hz with HDR. Owners of compatible LG or Samsung TVs with GeForce Now will benefit from the same 4K resolution boost throughout Q1 of 2023. Promotions and partnerships Opportunities for free access to GeForce Now include bundles from ATT as new fiber broadband or 5G customer mobile customers will receive a 6month Ultimate membership worth 120. Google offers a similar deal with select cloud gamingfocused Chromebooks bundled with three months of Ultimate membership. Partnerships with NVIDIA and three automotive groups were also announced at this years CES convention including BYD Hyundai and Polestar. Ideal for electric cars for cloud gaming as owners charge their batteries with saves backed up to the NVIDIA servers ready to continue playing on any device at home. Exact timings and plans havent been confirmed for specific model implementation or availability but more information will be released throughout the year. GeForce Now is set to enjoy a significant upgrade with its brandnew SuperPOD servers powered by the RTX 4080 GPU and all its benefits including some of the lowest latency gaming in the cloud. Boosts to framerates and resolutions with support for ultrawide monitors and even more mobile devices means its appeal should broaden throughout 2023 especially with bundled memberships from ATT and Googles gaming Chromebooks. The updated servers are set to roll out throughout January by region with access depending on your location. If youre already a GeForce Now member you can expect to hear from NVIDIA confirming the migration soon.

Acer Predator Helios Like the ROG Strix Scar The Predator Helios gaming laptops come in 16 and 18inch sizes and feature the latest 13thgen Intel Core processors Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series graphics enhanced cooling and beautiful big displays plus a whole lot of lights. Included among its three panel options is a Mini LED panel with a 250Hz refresh rate 100 P3 color gamut and a peak brightness of over 1000 nits. The new designs also use miniLEDs for the backlit keyboard with deep 1. 8millimeter key travel. The perkey lighting uses less power while giving the keys bright uniform color. A customizable RGB light bar also runs across the top of the back vents. Read more about the Predator Helios. Alienware x14 While Alienware will also have an impressive 18inch laptop the m18 the standout from its announcements is the sleek little Alienware x14. The company has updated its product ID again called Legend flattening the back to make it more comfortable to carry as well as an updated nose so its easier to open. It has a new foot design to allow for better cooling and greater comfort when used on your lap. The x14 has a taller 1610 display Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision support a fullHD webcam and a thermal material on the CPU and GPU for optimized heat dissipation. But overall it just looks amazing right down to its RGB touchpad. Read more about the Alienware x14. Asus Chromebook Vibe CX34 Flip Asus was one of the first to launch a Chromebook made for cloud gaming and now its launched its second the CX34 Flip. Its an allwhite twoinone Chromebook with colorblocked WASD keys and RGB backlit keyboard. It has a 1610 144Hz 1920x1200pixel display and fast WiFi 6E wireless. Paired with a garaged stylus this Chromebook should be good for work school or play. Itll be available with up to a 12thgen Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of memory. Its expected to be available later in Q1. Razer Blade 16 The new Blade 16 will have the requisite topoftheline 13thgen Intel Core i9 HX chips and Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series mobile graphics announced at the show. But it also has a unique dualmode 1000nit screen display. In Creator mode it operates at 4Kplus resolution at a refresh rate of 120Hz while in Gamer mode it drops the resolution to FHDplus to run at 240Hz. And like Acer Alienware and Asus Razer announced an 18inch Blade laptop. Read more about the Razer Blade 16. Gaming gear from CES 2023 Gaming laptops arent the only PC gaming devices being announced at CES. Heres a quick rundown of the best peripherals and accessories weve seen from the show so far. Alienwares 25inch AW2524H gaming monitor Alienwares display isnt the first to hit 500Hz refresh rate the speed at which the screen can completely redraw that honor went to the Asus ROG Swift 500Hz in May 2022. But that models screen is based on TN a technology renowned for its speed but not much else. Alienwares model is based on IPS which has better color better viewing angles and higher brightness and its the first time weve seen IPS pushed this hard. Its also a rarefied speed that only a pro esports player would appreciate. Read more about the Alienware AW2524H Asus ROG Swift PG248QP 24inch gaming monitor The new 540Hz ROG Swift PG248QP a 24incher unveiled at CES uses ETN the E is for esports technology Asus used in its previous 500Hz speed champion. Twisted nematic LCDs can hit high refresh rates but dont have the color brightness or viewing angles of other display types like OLED and IPS. But if you need smooth fast lowlatency performance more than other monitor qualities this ROG Swift might be worth it. Read more about the ROG Swift PG2448QP. Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 59inch curved gaming monitor CES is when gamingmonitor companies bring out the big guns and few are bigger than the new 57inch Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 a curved DisplayHDR 1000 model. Teased by AMD during its RX 7000series GPU launch in November as the first monitor announced with DisplayPort 2. 1 support the Neo G9 has 7680x2160pixel resolution. The high resolution plus HDR and fast 240Hz refresh rate make the highbandwidth DP 2. 1 essential even though its not a full 8K its a 329 aspect ratio. Read more about the Odyssey Neo G9. HyperX HX3D accessories HP announced a series of 3Dprinted addons at CES to customize and personalize the HyperXs keyboards mice and headsets. What makes this line interesting is that the keycaps and headphone stands are all produced on HPs industrial color 3D printers. Using powdered nylon theyre more advanced than the basic PLA plastic material used by most home 3D printers but still nontoxic and environmentally friendly. Read more about HyperX HX3D. Razer Leviathan V2 Pro Along with its new Blade laptops Razer announced an updated version of its desktop soundbar the Leviathan V2. The new Pro model adds 30 lighting zones head tracking via IR cameras and beamforming to more precisely target the sound toward your ears. It also updated the drivers for better lowend audio.

47,ASUS updates its ROG Zephyrus gaming laptops with NVIDIA RTX 40 series graphics,"ASUS has also updated its ROG Zephyrus family of gaming laptops at CES with Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA-supplied upgrades and the Zephyrus Duo is still unmatched.",https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/asus-updates-its-rog-zephyrus-gaming-laptops-with-nvidia-rtx-40-series-graphics,ASUS updates its ROG Zephyrus gaming laptops with NVIDIA RTX 40 series graphics The Zephyrus Duo is still totally bananas. What you need to know ASUS has updated its Zephyrus gaming laptop at CES 2023 with minor changes on the outside and the latest and greatest on the inside. Latest generation CPUs from AMD and Intel are offered across the range. All use NVIDIAs latest RTX 40 series graphics for laptops. If theres one thing that CES is never short of that would be new gaming laptops and ASUS has taken enough to fill the show all by itself. Joining the 2023 Strix lineup is a refreshed range of Zephyrus laptops that follow much the same trend. The ROG Zephyrus laptops share much of the same DNA as the Strix family but are more focused on being slimmer lighter and altogether more portable. None of that is changing and from the outside it doesnt look like much has at all. All the good stuff is going on under the hood. That means new CPUs from Intel and AMD are on offer and of course NVIDIAs latest RTX 40 series laptop graphics. The Zephyrus Duo is also sticking around and gets itself a suitably ludicrous 2023 performance upgrade too. ROG Zephyrus Duo is still absurdly impressive The dualscreened Zephyrus Duo has always been the star of the lineup and its getting itself a nice little upgrade package for 2023. The basic package remains the same but the internals have been given a kick in the pants with about the most power you could squeeze in. The CPU has been upgraded to a 16core AMD Ryzen 9 Zen 4 unit while the graphics are taken care of in the form of the NVIDIA RTX 4090. The max TGP is limited to 125W but given how sleek this laptop is and the fact you have two displays its nothing to be sniffed at. It also still commands a serious price nudging 4000. But theres still nothing else like it. Hardware upgrades across the range The rest of the Zephyrus range also sees significant upgrades. The M16 has been completely redesigned and will come with up to a 13th Gen Intel Core i9 24core CPU and NVIDIA RTX 4090 graphics. Packing ASUS latest TriFan cooling system and fullwidth heatsink the TGP on the latest model is 20W higher than its predecessor. The chassis has also had an upgrade with a better finish on its exterior and a muchimproved version of ASUS matrix display on the lid. As with the Strix family the Zephyrus laptops will be getting the latest Nebula displays with 3ms or less response time and 100 DCIP3 color gamut. The M16 additionally gets the Nebula HDR panel with 1100 nits brightness and QHD resolution at 240 Hz.

48,CES 2023 preview: What to expect at the Las Vegas tech extravaganza,"Next week at the CES 2023 tech trade show in Las Vegas, we'll once again be able to see the latest tech trends in person. Here's our preview.",https://venturebeat.com/ai/ces-2023-preview-what-to-expect-at-the-las-vegas-tech-extravaganza/,Next week at the CES 2023 trade show in Las Vegas well once again be able to see and hear about the latest tech trends in person. Last years event also took place in person but it was a shadow of its former self as the Omicron wave of COVID19 took its toll. The event only drew about 45000 last year far below the 175212 that showed up in January 2019. This year theyre expecting around 100000 people to show up according to Gary Shapiro CEO of Consumer Technology Association the trade group that stages the event. Last years event looked like a ghost town. At least it seemed that way in pictures as I canceled my trip about a week before the show after everybody else canceled their appointments with me. The same kind of cancellation tsunami hasnt happened this year. This year the show gets underway on Tuesday morning with some virtual sideline events from Nvidia and Acer. I think its safe to say well see plenty of new chips and PC gaming rigs announced. The difference this year is that because of the recession we can probably expect to buy more of these products sooner than we were able to do so during the shortages of the past couple of years. Event Intelligent Security Summit OnDemand Learn the critical role of AI ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies. Watch ondemand sessions today. A few thousand press people will start converging on Las Vegas on Tuesday and Wednesday for media events that officially begin with a talk on tech trends by Steve Koenig vice president of research at the CTA followed by the opening CES Unveiled press event. If its your first time to the show check out my tips and tricks for CES. On Wednesday big companies like LG Panasonic Samsung TCL and Sony will have their press conferences where they show off the new products coming this year. By Thursday the main show floors will open with nearly 3000 exhibitors across more than 2. 1 million square feet of space Shapiro said. Thats down from 4500 exhibitors and 2. 9 million square feet in January 2020. But its still a sizable show and it runs through Sunday. And while CES is still a place for the giants like Samsung and Sony the show will have 1000 new exhibitors and it will also have its traditional Eureka Park startup space in the Venetian. The big trends Last week PR Newswire reported that there was a 340 increase in mentions in CES 2023 press releases with more than 66 mentions in 2022 compared to 2021. NFT mentions were up 200 to 12 up from four. Sustainability mentions were up 63 to 49 up from 30. Robots were mentioned 49 times up only 2 from 48 a year ago. The losers Augmented reality slipped 12 to 30 from 34 and wearable dropped 38 from 88 to 55. In our interview Shapiro said well see an incredibly strong health tech category. Shapiro expects well see a lot of food tech like from a company called Suvie which cooks food while youre away and is ready when you get home. Based on the pitches Im getting I think well see a lot of tech related to AI health wearables energysaving devices the internet of things IoT sleep care elder care mental care smart cars robots and virtual reality think Sony and HTC at the very least. AI AI is kind of an invisible product but its presence will be visible everywhere at the show. Generative AI startups might be arriving on the scene too late to make a big presence at the show but everyone from big companies to startups will be talking about how AI is fueling a new generation of products. Embodied maker of the social interaction robot Moxie uses interactions enabled by generative AI to help promote social emotional and cognitive development in children ages five to 10. It is now shipping the robot that it has been showing for a couple of years. Square Off a maker of smart chessboards with an adaptive AI will be back to show off what it can with its partnership with Miko a consumer robotics company that makes AI robots for kids. There are a lot of people concerned about the encroachment of AI into our lives. Alice Little an awardwinning legal courtesan currently operating out of the Chicken Ranch brothel near Las Vegas said in a statement that AI tech will threaten the livelihood of sex workers who have come to depend on digital experiences such as Only Fans during the pandemic. She believes these kinds of creator platforms could be significantly hurt by AI particularly deepfake technology that creates fake images of real people. Well see this debate play out in industry after industry. Smart green vehicles on the rise AI is also going to get used in the latest vehicles. More than a dozen automakers will be at the show and theyll be showing off electric vehicles assisted driving features and more. John Deere which has one of the keynote slots for its CEO John May will show off AIbased tractors that can operate around the clock. Candela is manufacturing a new electric flying C8 consumer boat. It is an electric vehicle that rides above the waves and is a sibling to Candelas P12 electric hydrofoil ferry. Cenntro Electric Group is will unveil five new electric vehicles at CES including a hydrogenpowered semi and the production version of its iChassis. And as you can see below well have our share of flying cars again. Aska will be showing off its first driveandfly electric vertical takeoff and landing eVTOL aircraftcar hybrid. It is an electric vehicle that you can drive on the road like a car and fly in the air like a quadrocopter. Is it real Lets hope so. The metaverse Wherever AI gets mentioned the metaverse cant be far behind. And where the metaverse gets mentioned Web3 will come up as well. Its still early and a bit rare to see actual metaverse experiences on display at the show. Source Digital and Sansar announced they will show off a metaverse experience on smart TVs where you can engage in VRlike 2D or 3D experiences from the makers of Sansar which spun out of Second Lifes Linden Lab and was sold in 2020 to Wookey Projects. While we may not see a ton of actual metaverse projects at the show we will hear people talking about it especially in the visions presented in keynote speeches and panels. In fact Im going to moderate a panel at CES on Friday January 6 about how gaming will lead the metaverse. It will take place at 3 pm on Friday January 6 at LVCC North N262 and feature speakers from Area15 Upland Holoride and Tilt Five. With all this talk about the metaverse Shapiro isnt so worried that demand for an inperson CES will fall off. Were very optimistic that CES is so important to people around the world as buyers investors suppliers partners media consultants market analysts that we expect a strong showing in Las Vegas Shapiro said. But the digital platform will be an important supplement to many of the people going to Las Vegas who are just too busy to get to the conferences or connect with the exhibitors that they want to. Thats what the platform will be for to serve those people. As for blockchain OpenCarbon is touting its first nonfungible token NFT marketplace for carbon credits. The OpenCarbon platform delivers SECcompliant carbon offset financial products to efficiently source construct manage and retire largescale and complex carbon asset portfolios. The internet of things LG is partnering with Asleep to create smart home appliances that respond to human breathing and diagnose sleep stages to operate at an optimal level. So your air conditioning and heating and other home appliances can respond to how youre sleeping at night. Well see plenty of other examples of the internet of things creeping deeper into our lives. Lets hope the theme of Ubisofts Watchdogs game that these devices will be used by hackers and governments to spy on us wont come true. You can bet that the internet of things will further infiltrate its way into smart homes smart buildings and smart whatevers. Artificial intelligence buoyed by successes in computer vision neural networks and machine learning will be pervasive within these IoT devices. VR and gaming gear Sony will take the stage at CES to share details about its PlayStation VR2 headset and the games coming for the device which debuts on February 22. HTC is expected to make an announcement and a number of other VR headset makers are showing up at CES. And VRs platform is always changing. bHapticss new TactGlove can be worn like regular gloves. Its compatible with commercial VRAR headsets with camerabased hand tracking systems including Meta Quest 2 and costs 300 per pair. The new haptic gloves have 12 Linear Resonant Actuatortype motors LRA which the company says allows delicate and sophisticated feedback at the fingertips and wrists. Holoride will be at the show again display how you can play virtual reality games in the back seat of a car without losing your lunch. On the gaming side well see LGs 27inch OLED gaming monitor and Alienwares latest 18inch gaming laptop. Nvidia will likely talk about the GeForce RTX 40series graphics chips and AMD will attempt to outdo Nvidia with its own GPUs. MSI will show a flagship gaming laptop Titan GT77 that will feature a 4K144Hz Mini LED display. You can bet there will be a ton more on display at the show. Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su will kick off the show at 630 p. m. on Wednesday with a keynote speech. So were likely to hear about the latest Ryzen and Radeon chips. As for TVs some aficionados are hoping to hear more about QDOLED as the future of cuttingedge TV tech so itll be interesting to see if anyone has anything to add on that front. Health tech Valencell unveiling the first calibrationfree cuffless fingertip blood pressure monitor. Companies like Omron Healthcare have been whittling away at this kind of problem for years. Dexcom has received clearance from the FDA for its glucose monitor Dexcom 7 which makes it much easier to measure blood sugar levels for people with diabetes. Withings a pioneer of connected health will unveil its first foray into urine analysis with a miniaturized health lab that will change the way people monitor their health from the comfort and privacy of their own bathroom. If this works you may not have to pee in a cup at the doctors office or a lab so much. While we urinate on average seven times a day urine analyses are usually performed only once a year when requested by your health professional. Now Withings is making it possible to conduct health assessments from the comfort and privacy of your bathroom on a regular basis. And Im expecting to see more solutions than ever that target elderly people and their caregivers as tech has finally woken up to the demographic trend of the baby boomers get older. Tech isnt going to be just for the young anymore. Japans Asilla is showing off a security camera that sends you alerts to unusual things happening in real time like if someone falls on the ground. We can expect to see more of these products as Synaptics has created falldetection sensors that use AI to detect if people have fallen and need help. Food tech OneThird a Dutch food tech company will show a ripeness checker designed for use by grocers or grocery store shoppers. It lets them quickly scan an avocado and get accurate information about when it is ready for consumption no squeezing necessary. Apparently were not so good at the squeezing part as onethird of all food produced is wasted due to spoilage costing upwards of 1 trillion. OneThirds solution helps endconsumers get the freshest food and allows growers food distributors and grocers to predict the shelf life of fresh produce. Typhur will show off its allinone smart Sous Vide cooking machine with cooking classes and recipes from chefs all around the world including Michelin Star Chefs. Retro trends If youre not into all this new stuff you can see old stuff too. RCA will be among the retro brands coming to the show and it will show off home automation ebikes scooters and retrostyle electronics. For some of us that brings back some memories. Weird uses for new technology Ive been pitched some oddball things that I didnt expect see. For instance Glxkind is showing off an AIpowered baby stroller with a motor. It comes with an sleep solution with rockmybaby white noise and 360 safety bubble around the stroller. I suppose I shouldnt call this weird because it could be very useful for its target consumers. But its certainly something I didnt expect see. Meanwhile Osim is going to show off its uLove 3 WellBeing Chair which uses AI to help give you massages. The chair is designed to measure monitor and manage stress while giving you a fullbody massage. After picking up a video from your own library or by using a YouTube link you can add scents on the timeline to set up the perfect smell timing and duration for a scent to go with your video. Whats missing from CES Some common CES events wont happen. Nvidia will be doing an online press event but it wont be on the show floor. Apple doesnt exhibit at the show as it always does its own events. I expect we wont see as many masks either. But I suggest everybody be extra safe with so many people concentrated in Vegas. With as many as 71000 fewer people Im certainly hoping for fewer lines and crowds around the popular booths. But like many people Im curious what it will be like seeing people facetoface again at a huge trade show. Hopefully it will feel like were all getting back to business. Tech for the rest of us I have some hope that there will be some interesting technologies from nontech companies. Halio is showing off smart glass. You can put this on windows and building facades to prevent solar heat from cooking everybody inside a building. This reduces a facilitys carbon footprint by limiting energy used for air conditioning or heating. I like how its another example of how tech fades into the woodwork of everyday things. My favorite CES talk about tech from nontech companies was a few years ago when Arnold Donald the CEO of the worlds largest cruise company Carnival Cruises unveiled the Ocean Medallion wearable. That was interesting because it was an example of how technology was infiltrating a nontech business where the technology faded into the woodwork and the woodwork itself got smart. Carnival is now outfitting its 100plus cruise ships with the technology. In recent years Procter Gamble has also showed up with cool uses of tech in ordinary products such as putting sensors and AI into products such as skin advisers heated razors and more. It will be back this year with more products that promise the same kind of creativity as last years products which included a blemish remover that worked well on my face. I could still use more of that and I think we could all use tech that makes the current products that we use every day even better.

50,Graphics card prices are ridiculous — that's (one reason) why I'm backing Intel,"Graphics cards are ridiculously expensive nowadays and the market leader, NVIDIA, is very happy with that. But I'm not, and I'm backing Intel to help solve it.",https://www.windowscentral.com/graphics-cards-are-too-expensive-backing-intel,Graphics card prices are ridiculous thats one reason why Im backing Intel The 800 NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti is not the answer to the problem. I am really truly tired of graphics card prices. Dont get me wrong I love the NVIDIA RTX 4090 as a thing a feat of engineering. The performance it delivers is truly breathtaking even if its size is equal to its power. But its also insanely expensive. Even more so in the UK where I am. The same applies to the RTX 4080 and even AMDs newest range of highend Radeon cards. Albeit theyre at least more affordable than NVIDIAs. And the new 800 RTX 4070 Ti isnt close to being a solution. There are now three companies making consumer GPUs and its the newcomer Intel thats getting the most backing from me. The Intel Arc A770 is my favorite of all recently released graphics cards and I really really hope that Intel sticks it out and helps to change the game for us all. NVIDIA is the market leader and can do what it likes You know how the iPhone is crazy expensive and Apple has no interest in trying to make it more affordable Its popularity alone means theres little need to consider it. I feel like a similar situation is in play with NVIDIA graphics cards too. AMD has plenty of diehard fans but NVIDIA is the clear market leader. So wheres the motivation to try and make these things cheaper NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has already proudly declared Moores Law to be dead as part of the justification for high GPU prices. Not everyone shares the same opinion but NVIDIA has done everything it can to tell us that these things are expensive theyre always going to be expensive from now on and that its perfectly OK. Except its not. Not for those of us out there who dont live in a bubble and have bills to worry about. Theres also the small fact that NVIDIA like AMD starts at the highest end most expensive models first. As of now theres no RTX 4050 or 4060 series for desktop users. The RTX 4070 Ti is the lowest end new card available and its 800 at least. So buyers on tighter budgets either have to get something older or used. The same with AMDs latest highend Radeon cards. Or they could buy from Intel. Intel seems committed to trying to be affordable When the Intel Arc desktop graphics cards first launched the company was very clear in its press briefings that it believes in trying to keep prices as reasonable as possible. The Arc A770 16GB is the most expensive of the current batch with a recommended price of around 350. Sure it cant touch the RTX 4090 4080 or even the 4070 Ti. Not in gaming performance at least. But its not trying to be highend and I can tell you from plenty of experience using one its a very good graphics card. I play at 1440p and the A770 is capable of delivering high frame rates and graphical fidelity at this resolution. Hell it can even just about handle ray tracing at times. Its also every bit as modern as the 40 series. Besides ray tracing one of the standout features is the hardware AV1 encoder. All Intel Arc desktop GPUs have this right down to the circa 150 A380. AV1 encoding is going to become more important for content creators in the future and Intel has an affordable way to add one to your system without spending a heap of your hardearned cash. There are drawbacks such as no hardware support for DX9 so older games are hitandmiss as to how well they work if at all. Intel has since said it plans to work on this but it relies on Microsoft translating it into a more modern API. For example I can play the older Borderlands titles just fine but Batman Arkham Asylum will crash at the same point at the beginning of the game every single time. But for modern games things are generally fine. Intels commitment to value though alongside how good the firstgeneration Arc graphics cards actually are when you spend enough time with them is why Im fully behind the blue team. I like an underdog anyway but I have a real appreciation for what Intel is trying to do. Long may it continue. Saving money with Intel and cloud I also want to bring up cloud gaming because its becoming more and more attractive even from NVIDIA itself. Were not in a position yet where it can replace local gaming but its getting better all the time even if Google decided to get out of it. Naturally in areas without great internet its a nonstarter and the library available is nothing like what youll find on Steam for example. But with Microsoft and NVIDIA in particular putting a ton of effort into making it work for a lot of folks its another reason not to spend a fortune on an expensive graphics card. NVIDIAs own GeForce Now service has just announced a new tier based on the RTX 4080 at the same event as the RTX 4070 Ti launch. You can subscribe to this for a number of years for the same price as an RTX 4070 Ti and if you have the connection and hardware for it youll get better performance from the games. All of this adds up and Im definitely in the camp of spending less money on graphics cards without really having to sacrifice a great deal. Im enjoying my gaming and with the combination of Intel Arc and the cloud I dont feel like Im missing out on anything. No matter how much I love the RTX 4090.

51,"CES 2023 roundup: NVIDIA 4070 Ti, AMD Ryzen 7000, 13th Gen Intel, and PCs from Lenovo, Razer, HP, ASUS, and more","During CES 2023, we saw major announcements from AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA. Just about every major laptop and PC manufacturer also unveiled new hardware. Here are the highlights.",https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/ces-2023-roundup-nvidia-4070-ti-amd-ryzen-7000-13th-gen-intel-and-pcs-from-lenovo-razer-hp-asus-and-more,CES 2023 roundup NVIDIA 4070 Ti AMD Ryzen 7000 13th Gen Intel and PCs from Lenovo Razer HP ASUS and more CES saw a massive range of devices from the biggest names in tech. CES 2023 has officially wrapped up leaving us with a litany of devices to study and look forward to throughout the year. Just about all of the major tech brands made at least one announcement during or centered around the conference. AMD Intel and NVIDIA made CPU and GPU news while Dell LG Lenovo and Razer were among the many OEMs to unveil laptops PCs and accessories. With so many announcements to sort through its easy to miss a few or even tune out the news since it comes so quickly. Heres a recap of the biggest announcements at CES 2023 at least on the Windows side of things. Our colleagues over at Android Central covered CES too. NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti What was arguably the biggest news of last week wasnt necessarily good news. NVIDIA confirmed pricing for its RTX 4070 Ti graphics card. That GPU was once known as the RTX 4080 before NVIDIA pulled its launch and rebranded it under the 4070 Ti moniker. The RTX 4070 Ti was officially announced at CES 2023 in a move that was a bit of a surprise. The graphics card is designed for 1440p gaming. Its pricing starts at 800 which is 100 less than what it was going to priced at when it was the RTX 4080. That fact irked many who point to the price drop as proof that the card was overpriced under its previous branding. While the pricing proved controversial the RTX 4070 Ti will likely be among the best graphics cards when it comes to performance. The card should handle the best PC games at 1440p and be able to power some 4K gaming especially if you take advantage of Deep Learning Super Sampling DLSS 3 which is exclusive to NVIDIAs RTX 40 series. AMD Ryzen 7000 laptop CPUs AMD also hit the showroom floor at CES. The company unveiled its Ryzen 7000 series laptop CPUs for the next wave of PCs. Many of the laptops announced at the conference had variants powered by AMDs latest chips. Since the Ryzen 7000 range has a mixture of architectures and naming schemes it can be a bit confusing. Our managing editor Richard Devine broke down all of the new chips last week. Heres a quick rundown Ryzen 7020 series Based on Zen 2 with a maximum of 4cores and 8threads. Integrated graphics based on RDNA 2. Supports LPDDR5 memory. Ryzen 7030 series Based on Zen 3 with a maximum of 8cores and 16threads. Integrated graphics based on Vega and supports DDR4 and LPDDR4 memory. Ryzen 7035 series Based on Zen 3 with a maximum of 8cores and 16threads. Integrated graphics based on RDNA 2 and supports DDR5 and LPDDR5 memory. Ryzen 7040 series Based on Zen 4 with a maximum of 8cores and 16threads. Integrated graphics based on RDNA 3 and supports DDR5 and LPDDR5 memory. AMD also announced Ryzen AI last week. Its an XDNA Adaptive AI architecture that will feature in the Ryzen 7040 series of processors. This is the first time that an AI engine has been integrated into an x86 CPU and it promises better efficiency in the area. Intel 13th Gen chips Intel had a massive CES. The chipmaker unveiled the 13th Gen Intel Core mobile CPUs that power many of the newly announced laptops from CES 2023. The company also expanded its 13th Gen desktop CPU lineup and announced the new entrylevel Core i3 Nseries mobile CPUs. The family of 13th Gen Intel Core mobile processors includes the worlds first 24core processor for a laptop. In total Intel announced 32 chips across its latest generation of mobile CPUs. The flagship Intel Core i913980HX holds the top spot of the family thanks to its 24 cores. Our channel editor Ben Wilson shared the complete specs of all of the mobile CPUs last week. Intel first announced its 13th Gen desktop CPUs back in September 2022 but those were Kseries processors. Last week the chipmaker took the wraps off its 65watt and 35watt 13th Gen desktop CPUs. The chips have up to 8 more efficiency cores than the previous generation maxing out at a total of 24 8 performance and 16 efficiency. I broke down the full specs of the chips during CES. On the lower end of the processor spectrum Intel announced its entrylevel Core i3 Nseries mobile CPUs. The Nseries chips have up to 8 efficiency cores and are built on Intel 7 process tech. Those processors are designed for efficiency and are aimed at the education sector. Lenovos unique PCs Lenovo announced a large library of devices at CES 2023 including Legion gaming PCs a ThinkBook Twist with an eink display and an OLED screen and a powerful AllinOne. But one device stood out the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. That laptop features a pair of OLED displays and looks like the spiritual successor to the neverreleased Surface Neo. The Yoga Book 9i can flip around into different postures similar to Lenovos other Yoga Books. Unlike its flexible siblings the Yoga Book 9i can also be used with its dual displays stacked vertically or horizontally allowing the PC to act as a portable desktop. An included Bluetooth keyboard can attach to the Yoga Book 9i magnetically which lets a person use the computer as a traditional clamshell laptop. The Yoga Book 9i looks like a mix of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold and the Microsoft Surface Neo both of which have garnered attention from our readers over the years. The foldable PC is expected to ship in June 2023 with a starting price of 2100. Razer Blade 18 16 and more Razer announced its new lineup of Razer Blade laptops powered by 13th Gen Intel Core processors. The Razer Blade 16 features a dualmode LED QHD display with a refresh rate of 240Hz and a brightness of 1000 nits. The company also unveiled the Razer Blade 18 and a range of accessories including a webcam a PC soundbar and a gaming chair cushion with speakers and haptic feedback. The Razer Blade 18 and Blade 16 run on 13th Gen mobile processors from Intel alongside NVIDIA RTX 4000 series graphics. They also support DDR5 memory and max out several other aspects of their respective spec sheets. Based on their specs and designs both of Razers new offerings should rank among the best gaming laptops. There are quite a few models of the Razer Blade 18 and Blade 16 all of which were broken down by our gaming editor Rebecca Spear. Quite a few gaming accessories and peripherals were shown off by Razer last week. Project Carol is a gaming chair head cushion that includes haptic feedback powered by Razer HyperSense and 7. 1 surround sound audio. The Razer Edge is the latest gaming handheld. It has a 6. 8inch AMOLED display and runs on the Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 processor. With that hardware the Razer Edge can play native Android games while also supporting streaming through Xbox Cloud Gaming. Rounding out the wave of announcements was the Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra Webcam the Razer Leviathan V2 Pro soundbar and an adjustable head strap for the Meta Quest 2. HPs powerful PCs HP showed off some powerful new PCs at CES 2023. Laptops and desktops from the OMEN lineup were unveiled as well as the HP Dragonfly Pro and Dragonfly G4 laptops. The PCs run on the respective 13th Gen Intel CPUs for their form factor. The OMEN 40L and 45L top the charts with support for 13th Gen Intel Core i913900K and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090. On the laptop side of things the OMEN 17 features a 13th Gen Intel Core i913900HX mobile processor. The Dragonfly laptops are aimed at creators and freelancers. The Dragonfly Pro has an AMD Ryzen 7736U inside while the Dragonfly G4 has a 13th Gen Intel Core processor. ASUS 3D display ASUS showed off a new type of 3D OLED display that can make images appear in three dimensions without requiring special glasses. The screen is featured in the ASUS ProArt StudioBook 16 and VivoBook Pro 16X laptops. The laptops use what ASUS calls Spatial Vision to deliver a 3D experience thats unlike anything weve seen on a laptop before. In addition to the screen itself the secret sauce behind the 3D tech is eye tracking which is built into both laptops. By following where a persons eyes are the laptop can make the images appear properly in front of the user. Its a difficult feature to show off in videos since it requires hardware that wont be available until later this year. One of the demos I experienced was a simple showcase of some 3D models and its hard to put into words how impressive they looked. The level of detail visible is remarkable said our managing editor Richard Devine. It takes a second or two for your eyes to adjust but otherwise it just feels well normal. ASUS also detailed its 2023 Strix lineup of gaming laptops at the event. Those PCs feature the latest hardware from Intel NVIDIA and AMD depending on the model you choose.

52,This year's blockbuster IPO is between a rock and a hard place: listing in New York or London won't change Arm's fortunes in brutal downturn,"The SoftBank-owned chip designer is set to return to public markets this year, but listing in New York or London won't change the difficulties ahead.",https://www.businessinsider.com/arm-ipo-faces-rough-ride-2023-brutal-downturn-weighs-listing-2023-1,This years blockbuster IPO is between a rock and a hard place listing in New York or London wont change Arms fortunes in brutal downturn ARM is preparing for an IPO in 2023 that couldnt come at a more tricky time. The SoftBankowned chip designer will enter the market during a brutal downturn. The listing of Arm on the stock exchange in 2023 is set to be one of the years standout IPOs but the timing for a blockbuster public market entry couldnt be worse. The UK chip designer bought by SoftBank in 2016 for 32 billion is being prepared for a return to the public markets this year by the Japanese conglomerates CEO Masayoshi Son in the midst of one of the most brutal market downturns in recent decades. An attempt by US chip giant Nvidia to buy Arm for 40 billion fell flat last year amid intense regulatory scrutiny. This pushed SoftBank to reposition Arm for the public markets as the Japanese firm seeks to generate profits from assets that can offset losses in its venture capital business. Arms relisting isnt quite as clearcut as SoftBank would like with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak upping efforts in December for a duallisting involving London according to the Financial Times. This triggered a tugofwar with the US over a company considered the crown jewel of UK tech. But its a battle whose outcome is likely to prove futile either way for Arm a chip firm behind proprietary designs that find themselves in the worlds leading smartphones and cars with its fortunes even less clearcut in a future fraught with risk. Squashed investor appetite for speculative tech firms and a brutal downturn for the chip sector means SoftBanks attempt to steam ahead with listing Arm to support its own balance sheet woes in 2023 could prove to be more turbulent than it needs to be. The IPO door remains mostly shut Few other privately held tech companies itching for a public listing are rushing to market at a time when the IPO window appears all but shut. Figures from EY suggest that after a record year of listings in 2021 last years IPO market went into reverse mode. Deal volumes fell 45 and proceeds dropped by 61 in the face of reduced appetite for more speculative stocks against a backdrop of soaring interest rates. There is no sign of that trend changing in 2023. On Saturday after it emerged that fintech giant Ant Financial would no longer be under the control of Chinese billionaire Jack Ma the company confirmed to Reuters that it had no plans to carry out an IPO. Its previous plans to raise 37 billion in an IPO in late 2020 fell over after Chinese regulators introduced new lending rules. Any future plans for an IPO in the nearterm seem all but diminished as investors have become even more cautious around Chinas creeping involvement in markets that are at their most volatile in more than a decade. Others are biding their time too. Tech darlings in the West have all been points of conversation in recent years when it comes to techs next big IPO but few have signaled direct intent to go public as markets go through their rough and tumble moment. A Klarna IPO had been talked up right until it was forced to take a significant down round that slashed its valuation from 46 billion to 6. 7 billion. Meanwhile Stripe which filed plans with the SEC to go public in 2021 has been hesitant to make another move having laid off 14 of its staff towards the end of last year. SpaceX is another big company around which IPO talks have been swirling the rocket company led by Elon Musk. Given the challenges hes enduring with Twitter and Tesla adding to his headaches with a public listing for SpaceX seems unlikely though anything is possible with Musk. Plans to publicly list Arm have already been pushed back from early 2023 over concerns surrounding a market gripped by fear But the company is still on course for an IPO this year Ian Thorton Arms head of investor relations wrote in a letter in November. Clearly we want to IPO as soon as is possible. But given the current global economic uncertainty given the state of financial markets thats probably now unlikely to happen before the end of March 2023 the letter reportedly said. Chip sector in turmoil Arms other challenge with going public in 2023 lies in the state of the chip sector its down. Chip stocks in particular took a bruising in 2022 as supplychain crunches and shortages triggered by the Covid19 pandemic continued through the year with only some sign of letup for the sectors biggest players this year. Still many are continuing to suffer. Last week South Korean giant Samsung announced that its operating profits fell by almost 70 in its fourth quarter amid lower demand for chips spurred by reduced consumer spending on electronics and a chip oversupply. Former Arm pursuer Nvidia meanwhile has seen its shares take a hit following new license requirements implemented by the US government. In an SEC filing the company warned that the licenses would impact 400 million worth of sales to China in its third quarter last year. Such export controls have already hit Arm as it emerged last month that Alibaba was unable to buy chip designs from the British firm over fears that a license to sell highperformance designs to the Chinese tech giant wouldnt be approved. Such events are likely to spook wouldbe public investors in Arm at a time when they are belttightening. There are some signs that Arm would be insulated from some of the market tumult its growing focus on the car industry for instance has seen revenue for its automotive unit more than double since 2020 a rare spot of subsisting demand according to the Financial Times. But with chip revenue set to fall by almost 4 in 2023 to 596 billion per projections by Gartner it is hard not to think that any IPO of Arm may just be throwing it into treacherous waters.

53,NVIDIA relaunches 12GB RTX 4080 as the RTX 4070 Ti for $799,"NVIDIA scrubbed the launch of the 12GB RTX 4080 after user backlash, and the card is now being launched again under a new name. Say hello to the RTX 4070 Ti.",https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/nvidia-relaunches-12gb-rtx-4080-as-the-rtx-4070-ti-for-dollar799,NVIDIA relaunches 12GB RTX 4080 as the RTX 4070 Ti for 799 The 12GB version of the RTX 4080 is back in a new avatar. What you need to know NVIDIA has officially launched the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti for 799. The card is identical to the 12GB version of the RTX 4080 that debuted in November 2022 but was later scrubbed. NVIDIA isnt rolling out a Founders Edition variant of the RTX 4070 Ti. Back when NVIDIA introduced the GeForce RTX 4080 in November there were two variants a 16GB model and a 12GB version with tweaks to the memory bus width and number of cores for 899 300 less than the 16GB RTX 4080. However a lot of users took issue with the 12GB model and the backlash got to a point where NVIDIA scrubbed the variant altogether. It was a given that the model would launch under a different name and the brand is doing just that the 12GB RTX 4080 is back and it is now called the RTX 4070 Ti. The best part about the introduction of the RTX 4070 Ti is that it is debuting at 799 100 less than its asking figure when it was branded as the RTX 4080. Thats great news for gamers looking to get their hands on a card based on the new Ada Lovelace architecture. The new architecture brings exciting efficiency gains and huge performance uplifts with NVIDIA touting that the card is 3x faster than the mighty 2000 RTX 3090 Ti. Theres obviously a caveat associated with a claim like that but in my testing I found the RTX 4080 to be noticeably faster than the RTX 3090 Ti at 4K and QHD resolutions and the 4070 Ti is likely to be in a similar boat. NVIDIA hasnt shared much in the way of technical details just yet but given that it was officially launched in November the hardware is unchanged. That means were looking at 7680 cores 12GB of GDDR6X memory at a 192bit wide interface leading to a bandwidth of 504GBs. And coming in at a requirement of 285W the RTX 4070 Ti is a little more efficient than the 4080. The RTX 4070 Ti is turning out to be the best GPU for customers still on the GTX 1080 Ti or the firstgen RTX 2080 and NVIDIA notes that the card is able to provide a 12x relative performance upgrade over the 1080 Ti. Sales of the RTX 4070 Ti will kick off starting January 5 for 799 and notably NVIDIA isnt offering a Founders Edition version of the card it will only be available with AIB vendors like Zotac ASUS MSI Gigabyte Colorful and others.

54,How to Fix Nvidia GeForce Drivers Not Downloading or Installing,The latest drivers will let you make the most out of your Nvidia GPU. But what should you do if you can't download and install them?,https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-nvidia-geforce-drivers-not-downloading-or-installing/,Having trouble downloading graphics drivers with Nvidia GeForce Experience or its other tools Have you tried installing the downloaded drivers only to find that they do not follow your directions If so you may not be able to fully utilize the powerful graphics card youve purchased for hundreds of dollars from Nvidia. Why does this happen So lets explore why Nvidia drivers wont download or install on your device and what you can do about it. How to Fix Nvidia Drivers Not Downloading on Windows There are two primary reasons why Nvidia drivers do not download the automatic download setting is disabled or there is a problem with the Nvidia graphics software itself. Here are the steps you need to follow to fix it. 1. Enable Automatic Downloads in the Nvidia GeForce Experience Client To enable the automatic downloads in the Nvidia GeForce client follow the below steps Launch GeForce Experience by searching for GeForce Experiencein Windows Search. In the topright corner click Settings gear icon. In the left sidebar click the Generaltab. Then scroll down to the bottom of the Generalsettings page and check the box for Automatically download driver updates and let me choose when to install. Close the Nvidia client and relaunch it after that. Then select the Drivers tab on the clients home screen and youll find the latest update available for installation. If you dont see any click the Check For Updates box which will load the latest update. If that doesnt help move on to the next step. 2. Manually Download the Drivers If the above method doesnt work you can manually download and install the driver. Here are the steps you need to follow. Go to the Nvidia Driver Downloads page. Choose the correct Product Type Product Series and Product. Next choose the proper Operating System. Select Game Ready Driver GRDfrom the Download Typedropdown menu. Click on the Searchbutton once the correct options have been selected. Depending on the hardware Nvidia will find the appropriate driver. Click on the Downloadbutton. Thats it. If Nvidia Experience or any other Nvidia client fails to download the driver automatically you can manually download them. But what if they dont install after downloading How to Fix Nvidia Drivers Not Installing on Windows Nvidia drivers fail to install due to interference from Windows security protection or an antivirus app protecting your device using an outdated Nvidia GeForce client downloading an incompatible driver that is not supported by your graphics card having a physical connection issue or having an outdated operating system. If Nvidia software fails to install drivers follow these steps. 1. Turn Off Antivirus Protection The Windows Defender or thirdparty antivirus software helps us catch viruses before they cause havoc on our devices. There are times however when they dont let even the safetoexecute processes complete because they consider them a threat. Firstly you should ensure that antivirus or Windows Defender doesnt interfere with the drivers installation. Disabling them is the best way to accomplish this. Not sure how to disable Windows builtin security Check out our guide on how to disable Windows Defender. Additionally if youre using any thirdparty antivirus software refer to the official instructions on their website explaining how to turn them off. After disabling them try installing the drivers again. Reenable Windows Defender or your antivirus after successfully installing the drivers. You could put your device at risk otherwise. 2. Ensure Windows Is UptoDate Running an outdated Windows OS can also impede the installation of drivers just as outdated GeForce Experience clients can cause problems. Therefore make sure that no operating system updates are pending. Our guide on managing Windows Updates will show you how to check for the most recent updates and install them. 3. Rule Out Compatibility Issues Your Nvidia drivers may also fail to install if youre trying to install incompatible drivers. Every graphics card requires a different driver. Hence the Nvidia client will simply give up if the driver you are trying to install does not match your hardware. Thus you should carefully check the graphics card installed on your device then manually download the driver corresponding to your hardware per the instructions about manually downloading drivers. If you are confident that your drivers are compatible with your hardware proceed to the next step. 4. Install the Driver Manually If the Nvidia client cannot install the drivers you can install them manually. To do that follow the instructions listed above for downloading drivers manually. When the driver has been downloaded rightclick the driver installer package and click Run as administrator. After that follow the onscreen instructions to install the drivers manually. 5. Install an Older Driver Version Are you trying to install a newly released driver Occasionally newly released drivers contain bugs that prevent them from installing. If you encounter this issue with a driver released recently by Nvidia try installing an older version. If the old version installs smoothly the problem must be with the new drivers. The Nvidia forum can be an excellent place to confirm this since other users may also have the same issue. If they are then wait for Nvidia to fix the problem. You can stick with the older version until then. 6. Reinstall the GeForce Experience Client If none of the above fixes helps you install the drivers your last resort should be to uninstall the GeForce Experience or any other client youre using and reinstall it. This will undoubtedly be timeconsuming. However it will save you from having to deal with this issue again in the future. For a successful reinstall uninstall your current installation and delete any junk files on your system. In some cases remnants of some client files may remain in the following locations which will need to be manually deleted CProgram FilesNVIDIA Corporation CProgram Files x86NVIDIA Corporation Smoothly Download and Install Nvidia Drivers Being unable to download and install newly released drivers can be tempting. If you follow the fixes in the list you should be able to download and install Nvidia drivers seamlessly. If the fixes dont work you can use thirdparty tools to update your drivers.,2023-01-11T22:00:06Z,NVIDIA relaunches 12GB RTX 4080 as the RTX 4070 Ti for $799,Extremely Negative,210,"['issue', 'problem']",[],"[Harish, Jonnalagadda]"
