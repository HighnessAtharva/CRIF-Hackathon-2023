The views expressed here are the authors. Read more opinion on CNN. When Ryan Murphy accepted the Carol Burnett Award at the Golden Globes this week he didnt thank his mother or God. He thanked awardwinning gay actor Billy Porter who presented Murphy with his award while wearing a transcendent tuxedo gown and trans actress MJ Rodriguez who broke barriers at last years untelevised Golden Globes as the first trans actress to win a Golden Globe. Citing a litany of their accomplishments Murphy went on to acknowledge by name and hometown as he had with Porter and Rodriguez Niecy NashBetts Matt Bomer and Jeremy Pope. He called them a beacon of hope and progress. Murphys emotional speech on the evolution of queer representation in entertainment beginning with his urging the room of celebrities to stand and deliver to Rodriguez the televised standing ovation she hadnt gotten last year was a powerful reminder that queer people are so often talked about when theyre not in the room that for so long weve put in the work and not gotten the recognition. It was also an incredibly inspiring moment the queering of a major Hollywood event a rainbow punctuation on a growing bevy of artistic work from films such as Tr to shows such as Sort Of showcasing the creative power of LGBTQ storytelling and expression. Its clear that culture is perhaps by necessity carrying the weight of progress right now. Murphys speech was a particular bright spot in an increasingly dark political moment for LGBTQ Americans. A recent Pew Research poll shows that the majority of Americans including the majority of Republicans and Black Americans regardless of party believe that gender is determined by sex assigned at birth complicating the LGBTQ advocacy communitys efforts to clap back against the battery of bills blocking trans peoples access to health care and athletics. It doesnt help matters that there is a growing narrative around trans people detransitioning a very small occurrence that is being exploited in the ongoing culture wars to legislate against trans and LGBTQ Americans. For the trans adolescent who feels like their government doesnt want them to access the potentially lifesaving health care they need or the queer teacher who is forced to hide the picture of their spouse at work or the kid with two moms who fears getting bullied or for his familys future the political landscape has become a battlefield. Extremist rightwing leaders are weaponizing classrooms and doctors offices sports fields and public gathering spaces. Against this backdrop these cultural moments Rodriguez getting a standing ovation in real life Cate Blanchett playing a powerful and flawed protagonist in fiction create muchneeded respite. They give LGBTQ people hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel that we can be celebrated on screen and off as complex imperfect beautiful human beings just like everyone else. Murphys hopeful speech lifting up queer role models stands in refreshing contrast to all the vitriol. It amplifies recent and continued LGBTQ gains in pop culture and entertainment. Netflixs Stranger Things actor Noah Schnapp recently came out in a Tik Tok video. HBOs Sort Of centers nonbinary queer Pakistani Canadian actor Bilal Baig in the freshest and queerest show Ive seen in a long time. HBO shares a parent company with CNN. The rich textured Oscar frontrunner Tr is a momentous step in the mainstream development of portraying queer characters. Take Blanchett in the stunning 2015 Carol. At the time a groundbreaking cinematic moment in centering queer representation it was still steeped in the plot of tragic punishment for being LGBTQ. Blanchetts character a closeted divorcing 1950s housewife in this film based on Patricia Highsmiths novel The Price of Salt pays the ultimate price for being her true self when she gets caught in an affair with a woman played by Rooney Mara the loss of custody of her daughter. Seven years later in Tr the same magnificent actor faces down epic tragedy with a major distinction namely that her undoing is all her doing agnostic of her LGBTQ status. Protagonist Lydia Tar is an abusive brilliant composer and musician who just happens to be a lesbian. Blanchetts development as an onscreen lesbian well forgive her for not being a lesbian in real life because shes Cate Blanchett and Murphys moment in the spotlight at the Golden Globes this week demonstrate that weve arrived that were capable of creating mainstream blockbuster hits that upstage queer representation without having to lean on tropes or typecasting. Get our free weekly newsletter Seeing ourselves represented is one big step in creating the next generation of selfassured LGBTQ Americans and our families who just want to feel safe being ourselves and moving through our everyday lives. Whether these moments are enough to create a leap for LGBTQ equality more broadly remains to be seen particularly against the backdrop of the rightwing American political landscape as it stands. Its hard being an LGBTQ kid in America in fact all over the world Murphy said. You were often told you will never become anything. You have to hide your life to survive. But for those kids watching tonight I offer up MJ and Billy and Niecy and Matt and Jeremy as examples of possibility. There is a way forward. Murphys career success alongside the other queer Hollywood Alisters he honored with his words are testament that we have made strides. No matter how much the divisive political hellscape threatens to pull us back from progress pop culture shows us that maybe just maybe its possible that weve come too far to turn back now.
1,Democratic Rep. Katie Porter is eyeing a potential California Senate run in 2024: Politico,"Porter, a third-term lawmaker who was reelected last November in her Orange County-anchored district, is a top national progressive star.",2023-01-07T21:14:18Z,https://www.businessinsider.com/katie-porter-potential-2024-california-senate-bid-feinstein-democrats-2023-1,Democratic Rep. Katie Porter announces shes running for California Senate and shes not waiting for Sen. Dianne Feinstein to step aside Rep. Katie Porter of California on Tuesday officially announced a 2024 Senate bid. Sen. Feinstein is up for reelection in 2024 but hasnt yet announced whether shell run for another term. Rep. Katie Porter of California one of the most prominent progressive Democrats in the country will run for the Senate in 2024. Porter a thirdterm lawmaker who was reelected last November in her Orange Countyanchored district boasts strong ties to leading progressive groups and has molded a profile in Congress as someone who sharply questions powerful business leaders from her perch on the House Oversight Committee. In times like these California needs a warrior in Washington she said in her official campaign announcement on Tuesday. I dont do Congress the way others often do. I use whatever power I have to speak hard truths to the powers that be to not just challenge the status quo but call it out name names and demand justice she continued to say. That goes for taking on Wall Street and the big banks big oil and big pharma. Its why I refused to accept corporate PAC and lobbyist campaign money. I dont want it. And Im leading the fight to ban congressional stock trading because its just wrong. To win these fights its time for new leadership in the Senate. At the moment 89yearold Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein a former San Francisco mayor who has served in the upper chamber since 1992 could very well seek reelection. Feinstein now in her fifth term is widely expected to retire after the upcoming 2024 cycle but she has not yet made a decision on her intentions. Everyone is of course welcome to throw their hat in the ring and I will make an announcement concerning my plans for 2024 at the appropriate time the senator said in a statement on Tuesday. Right now Im focused on ensuring California has all the resources it needs to cope with the devastating storms slamming the state and leaving more than a dozen dead. In entering the race Porter is staking out a lane as an lawmaker who would usher in a different sort of governance. Katie Porter katieporteroc January 10 2023 Change can be electrifying and exhilarating but change can also be disruptive like the constant assault on our democracy and the dangerous imbalance in our economy the lawmaker said in her announcement. The threat from socalled leaders like Mitch McConnell has too often made the United States Senate the place where rights get revoked special interests get rewarded and our democracy gets rigged. While in the House Porter has become nationallyknown for her use of whiteboards where she has been unrelenting in grilling chief executives about their business practices and how they affect consumers. I think about the whiteboard as a teaching tool she told Yahoo Finance in an interview last year. The American people are owed answers from their government and the whiteboard is a way to help make it easier for everyday people to understand what Washington is getting done or not getting done to solve their problems. Porter was first elected to office in 2018 unseating thenRepublican Rep. Mimi Walters by four points 5248 in a wave year that saw Democrats win every Orange Countybased congressional district. She was reelected in 2020 defeating former Mission Viejo mayor Greg Raths by seven points 53. 546. 5. In November Porter won a tough reelection race edging out former California assemblyman Scott Baugh by four points 5248. Candidates who might compete against Porter in a potential open seat include Rep. Barbara Lee a liberal icon who represents a district in the San Francisco Bay Area Rep. Adam Schiff the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who represents a Los Angelesarea district and Rep. Ro Khanna a 46yearold Bay Area progressive who was a national cochair of Sen.

Because of my terrible hunched posture Im always looking for an opportunity to lie down and alleviate the pain in my back. Because of my great love of trees I am always looking for an opportunity to lie down in a woodland. And because we lost a beloved cousin tragically young this summer I was also looking for opportunities to be quiet and think of him and have a little cry. This was my moment. We recently welcomed a puppy to our family and he has taken a special liking to me because Im the person who walks him and feeds him Im not really a dog person so hes made it his personal mission to convert me. I guess its working I love him in a sort of gently revelatory deeply trying mustlearntobepatient way. He joined me in the ancient green cavern whining. I dont like to have my face licked when Im having a reflective moment. His name is Happy so if you were passing the lime coppice you would have heard me saying No Happy. Fucks sake Happy. Happy please leave me alone for two seconds. This photograph shows the moment my youngest son came into the coppice to try to coax him out. Happy is so baffled. I suppose hes wondering why Im on the ground. I am wearing Vivobarefoot shoes and white socks a deadly sexy look I think youll agree and my wife and other sons are calling HAPPY HAPPY and one of them is reading me the sign about the 20year coppicing cycle and the blend of traditional and modern forestry techniques and one of them is asking when precisely I preordered Fifa 23 and when might it arrive and I can feel that the water bottle is leaking in my rucksack so my makeshift pillow is becoming wet and the light is so extraordinarily beautiful coming through the neon green of the lime leaves. It is pretty humbling that this same thing has been living here in this spot for two millennia and humans have collaborated with it to help it adapt and survive so I get my phone out to take a picture but my phone is full of thousands of pictures of trees and the better photo is my son patiently imploring Happy to leave me alone leave me be let me have my two minutes alone so I take this photo and then another son comes in and asks me to join in the argument about whether they can have fizzy drinks at the cafe and I like the idea that this tree has overheard 2000 years of very mundane human chat and it reminds me of Amitav Ghoshs observation that on a different timescale it might appear evident that trees are gardening humans. Then the dog and a child help me up and on we go. Max Porters new novel Shy is out next year
3,California Rep. Katie Porter announces 2024 Senate bid,California Democrat Rep. Katie Porter announced on Tuesday on Twitter that she will seek Sen. Dianne Feinstein's Senate seat in 2024.,2023-01-10T16:22:07Z,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/california-rep-katie-porter-announces-2024-senate-bid/story?id=96337549,Democratic Rep. Katie Porter announced on Tuesday morning her candidacy for Californias Senate seat currently held by fellow Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein the longestserving female senator in history. In her announcement video posted to Twitter Porter said its time for new leadership in the U. S. Senate. I dont do Congress the way others often do. I use whatever power I have speak hard truths to the powers that be Porter said. To not just challenge the status quo but call it out. Porters video shows images of the Capitol attack noting the threat of a constant assault on our democracy before she calls out Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell by name and socalled leaders for she says having made the Senate a place where rights get revoked special interests get rewarded and our democracy gets rigged. Especially in times like these California needs a warrior in Washington and thats exactly why Im announcing my candidacy for the United States Senate in 2024 Porter said. Although Feinstein whos 89 has not announced whether shell seek reelection other California Democrats may be eyeing the seat including Reps. Barbara Lee and Adam Schiff. Everyone is of course welcome to throw their hat in the ring and I will make an announcement concerning my plans for 2024 at the appropriate time Feinstein said in a statement hours after Porters video. Right now Im focused on ensuring California has all the resources it needs to cope with the devastating storms slamming the state. California has a jungle primary which means two Democrats could be pitted against each other during the general election. Porter 49 a progressive star in the Democratic party won reelection this past November in a tight race for Californias 47th Congressional District. The former middle school math teacher and law professor has served in the House of Representatives since 2019. She holds a closely divided district and has lagged behind California Democrats cycle after cycle. A mother of three Porter has gained social media notoriety for her interrogations using whiteboards on the Oversight and Natural Resources Committees even bringing the props to latenight television appearances. Just last week she appeared to subtly troll Republicans during marathon speakership votes as she read a carefullytitled book on the House floor. While its speculated that Feinstein will not run again in 2024 the senator has not directly commented on her political future despite questions regarding her health and age. Feinstein has been a crusader for female representation in Congress. This past November she became the longestserving woman senator surpassing Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. It has been a great pleasure to watch more and more women walk the halls of the Senate. We went from two women senators when I ran for office in 1992 to 24 today and I know that number will keep climbing Feinstein said. The term for Californias other senator Alex Padilla expires in 2029.

N trade secrets to benefit China the U. S. Justice Department said. Xiaoqing Zheng 59 of Niskayuna New York was convicted of conspiracy to commit economic espionage following a fourweek jury trial that ended in March last year according to the Justice Department. U. S. District Judge Mae DAgostino also sentenced Zheng to pay a 7500 fine and serve one year of postimprisonment supervised release. U. S. officials have said the Chinese government poses the biggest longterm threat to U. S. economic and national security and is carrying out unprecedented efforts to steal critical technology from U. S. businesses and researchers. China denies the allegations. Zheng was employed at GE Power in Schenectady New York as an engineer specializing in turbine sealing technology. He worked at GE from 2008 until the summer of 2018 the Justice Department said. The trial evidence showed Zheng and others in China conspired to steal GEs trade secrets surrounding its groundbased and aviationbased turbine technologies to benefit China including Chinabased companies and universities that research and manufacture parts for turbines the Justice Department added. This is a case of textbook economic espionage. Zheng exploited his position of trust betrayed his employer and conspired with the government of China to steal innovative American technology said Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the Justice Departments national security division. The United States had accused the former GE engineer and another Chinese businessman named Zhaoxi Zhang in 2019 of stealing secrets and spying on GE to aid China. Zheng had pleaded not guilty at the time. A U. S. federal court in Cincinnati sentenced a Chinese national in November to 20 years in prison after he was convicted of plotting to steal trade secrets from several U.

6,"Homebuyers hope 'patience pays off' as prices drop, recession predictions loom - CTV News",Some prospective buyers have lamented the torrid pace Canada's real estate market has moved at in recent years. But many feel 2023 may be the year their luck changes.,2023-01-08T16:45:38Z,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/homebuyers-hope-patience-pays-off-as-prices-drop-recession-predictions-loom-1.6222148,Homebuyers hope patience pays off as prices drop recession predictions loom Andrew Hamilton and his wife bid farewell to their home in Torontos Junction neighbourhood roughly a year and a half ago when housing prices were soaring but finding a new abode proved tricky. With no available homes meeting their needs or price range the couple opted to temporarily use the equity they got from selling their house on a rental property in Etobicoke. But they still have one eye on the market and are hoping the current cooldown will deepen enough for them to snag another home. Patience I think will pay off said Hamilton. His sentiments are common throughout the sector especially with prospective buyers who have lamented the torrid pace Canadas real estate market has moved at in recent years. But many feel 2023 may be the year their luck changes. Prices have steadily declined since last spring bidding wars are less frequent and economists foresee an end to the Bank of Canadas quick succession of interest rate hikes that have added hundreds if not thousands of dollars to monthly mortgage payments. It just takes time said Despina Zanganas a Toronto Realtor with PSR Brokerage. She expects buyers who delayed purchases will feel more comfortable this year as the changed housing market sinks in. Theyre getting used to it she said. People are saying that they dont have to go into bidding wars and put in unconditional offers. Now they have the freedom to put in conditional offers so thats giving a lot of people a bit more confidence. But theres at least one major change that could be on the horizon. Economists have been predicting 2023 will be the year Canada enters another recession though its unclear how severe the downturn will be. Douglas Porter sees a 25 to 30 per cent chance Canadas economy nails a soft landing when inflation and interest rate hikes gently end helping avoid a recession. Theres a 50 per cent chance of a shallow downturn and a 20 to 25 per cent chance of something more serious. All of those have implications for the housing market said the chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. Clearly the less intense the hit to the economy the better the news is for the housing market. Even in current conditions he sees the housing market as one of the weakest parts of the economy a phenomenon unseen in years if not decades. His forecast predicts that by the time the current economic cycle is complete home prices will have fallen by between 20 and 25 per cent from their peak noting they have already dropped 10 per cent. The Canadian Real Estate Association said last month that the actual national average home price was 632802 in November a 12 per cent decline from the same month last year. As prices tick down Porter said the market sits in suspended animation with sellers wary of listing their properties because they wont fetch what neighbours did last year and buyers sitting on the sidelines waiting for better mortgage rates and more inventory. Certainly you dont want to jump in and buy when it looks as if prices can drop a whole lot more Porter said. The decreases seen so far have been offset by a rapid string of hikes to the Bank of Canadas key interest rate which sits at 4. 25 per cent the highest its been since January 2008. Allison Van Rooijen vicepresident of consumer credit at Meridian Credit Union estimated the latest hike half a percentage point in December would bump payments on a 450000 variablerate mortgage on a 25year amortization up another 130 or so every month. Since the beginning of 2022 rising rates have amounted to roughly 1000 more per month for the same mortgage. To me the interest rates story is the biggest one this year that will have the biggest effect by far said Porter. The reality is the price correction weve seen so far really hasnt even made up for the run up in interest rates. I would still assert that the market is still digesting the interest rate increase and we havent seen it fully reflected in prices yet. The Toronto Regional Real Estate Board said Thursday that the average price sat at 1051216 in December a 9. 2 per cent fall from a year ago. A day earlier the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver reported the composite benchmark price now sits at 1114300 a three per cent decrease from December 2021 and on Tuesday the Calgary Real Estate Board revealed the average price was up four per cent to 495231. Porter expects the Prairies to be the most resilient market because it didnt encounter as much of an overvaluation as other regions did in the first years of the COVID19 pandemic. He sees the Atlantic provinces and some parts of British Columbia in the middle of the pack because they didnt have quite the boom that Ontario had but are now grappling with an increase in immigration. Hell be watching mediumsized cities in southwestern Ontario like Hamilton Kitchener London and Windsor most closely because they absolutely took off during the pandemic but have since slid into a deep correction. Porter will be looking to see whether they are showing signs of stabilization which could be an omen for the broader market. But he warns the unprecedented nature of the pandemic makes the current housing market tough for anyone to predict. The housing market might hold up a bit better than what were anticipating just because it is such an unusual cycle he said. But I dont think any of us can have a great deal of confidence in our forecasts these days because theres so many unique aspects to this economy that were dealing with.

I want to wish all of us one thing victory. And thats the main thing. One wish for all Ukrainians Zelenskiy dressed in his trademark khaki outfit said in a video message a few minutes before midnight. He reiterated as he often has since Russia began its invasion in Ukraine in February that he will stay with his people while they are fighting for freedom. We were told to surrender. We chose a counterattack he said. We are ready to fight for it freedom. Thats why each of us is here. Im here. We are here. You are here. Everyone is here. We are all Ukraine. Russias President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 calling it a special operation to denazify and demilitarise Ukraine which he said was a threat to Russia. Kyiv and its Western allies say Putins invasion was merely an imperialist land grab. Putin used his own New Years address to rally the Russian people behind troops fighting in Ukraine. While Moscow had planned a swift operation to take over its neighbour the war is now in its 11th month marked by many embarrassing Russian battlefield setbacks and Ukraines successful defence of most of its land. Russian forces have been engaged for months now in fierce fighting in the east and south of Ukraine to defend the lands Moscow proclaimed it annexed in September and which make up the broader Ukrainian industrial Donbas region. On Saturday Zelenskiy vowed to bring back what has been taken away. Let this year be the year of return. The return of our people. Soldiers to their families. Prisoners to their homes. Emigrants to their Ukraine. Return of our lands Zelenskiy said. The return of what has been stolen from us. The childhood of our children the peaceful old age of our parents.

The Public Health Agency of Canada said Saturday it would implement a pilot project on wastewater testing from aircraft with Vancouver airport and expand such an existing project with Toronto Pearson airport to assess COVID19 prevalence in various parts of the world. Samples are sequenced to monitor for novel variants the agency said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters earlier this week it was considering sampling wastewater taken from international aircraft to track any emerging new COVID variants. China had kept its borders all but shut for three years imposing a strict regime of lockdowns and relentless testing. It abruptly reversed course on Dec. 7 toward living with the virus and infections have spread rapidly in recent weeks. China has rejected criticism of its COVID19 statistics and said it expects mutations to be more infectious but less severe. China will stop requiring inbound travelers to go into quarantine starting Jan. 8 but they still need a negative PCR test result within 48 hours before departure.

LEAGUE MEETING The NFL held a special league meeting on Friday to vote on changes to the playoff setup after it was decided the Bills and Bengals game would not be completed despite the contest having postseason implications for both clubs.

The location of a wildcard game in the AFC North could also potentially be decided by a coin toss supervised by the commissioner depending on the results. Yesterdays news of Damars improving condition lifted not only my spirits but the spirits of the entire league began Goodell during a Friday conference call. Today with the owners the reasons for needing to cancel the BuffaloCincinnati game were explained.

He likes to keep close to the tune and relishes a real slow ballad. Oddly enough he doesnt play it with the customary warm vibrato. In fact theres hardly any vibrato at all but his slightly husky tone holds your attention like an instrumental Nat King Cole. Person is also a noted record producer and has been around long enough to know exactly who to choose when setting up a band. Guitarist Russell Malone is probably the best known here but look up the others and youll see theyre all in the A team Larry Fuller piano Matthew Parrish bass and Lewis Nash drums. Having chosen them Person makes sure that each one gets his fair share of the limelight and theres some great playing all round on these 10 tracks. The songwriters chosen stretch from Cole Porter to Percy Mayfield. If I had to choose one number it would be Paul Ankas Put Your Head on My Shoulder played with such delicacy that I keep going back to hear it again.

SA Caio Paes de Andrade has informed the board of directors of his resignation two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. The resignation comes shortly after the countrys mines and energy ministry said it would formally appoint Senator Jean Paul Prates to head the staterun firm after President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced it last week. Petrobras did not immediately comment on the resignation. Andrade had been handpicked by former rightwing President Jair Bolsonaro after three of his predecessors left following clashes with Bolsonaro over Petrobras fuel pricing policy. The move paves the way for Prates a senator from Lulas leftwing Workers Party to take the helm before the current managements tenure ends though he must still win approval from internal Petrobras committees. Prates will need final approval as a board member and subsequently as CEO from the firms current board of directors. Andrades term had been set to expire in April but Reuters reported late last year that he had decided to resign earlier. Our Standards The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

For those looking to tap into trending items the Boxing Day sales could prove fruitful with many of the most popular pieces on offer. I Shop Therefore I Am reads the 1987 work of Barbara Kruger. So if we are defined by what we own what does this say about consumers in 2022 It appears many wanted to continue to enjoy pandemic discoveries such as comfortable footwear with the luxury etailer Yoox reporting that its bestselling shoe of 2022 was the Boston Clog from Birkenstock. The German brand founded in 1774 has seen somewhat of a resurgence over the past two years. The once beloved shoes of healthcare workers are now a favourite among celebrities and influencers with fans including Kendall Jenner Gigi Hadid and Sienna Miller. With prices starting at 90 the online fashion search engine Lyst said searches for the Boston Clog style increased by 593 in the first six months of 2022. This marks the fifth time in two years it has appeared on the Lyst Index. Its taupe suede version was continually sold out with many appearing for over double the original price on resale platforms. Meanwhile both Office and Amazon Fashion Europe reported Crocs as a top seller. At Office it was the black Crocs with a faux fur lining that performed best. Much like Birkenstock Crocs were previously popular among hospital and hospitality workers. Founded in 2002 the brand enjoyed renewed interest during the pandemic. They were the second fastestgrowing brand in 2022 endorsed by everyone from Stormzy to David Hockney. Comfort was also trending at Primark with two loungewear items appearing in its top three products. High sales of the Snuddie a 16 fleecelined item Primark describes as an oversized snuggly hoodie come blanket perhaps reflect consumers concerns over energy prices. The description also mentions keeping toasty and chills at bay. Meanwhile its seamfree sets featuring crop tops shorts and leggings are very similar to Skims the hugely soughtafter Kardashianfounded brand. Primark prices start from 3. 50 for a crop top compared with 40 at Skims. Elsewhere an increased interest in workwear reflects a change in working environments as many returned to the office. According to property consultancy Remit the daily average number of employees in England and Wales working from the office hit its highest level since the pandemic in October. In Londons West End 57 of staff were back at their desks while numbers were also high in Docklands home to many financial institutions opposed to employees working from home. Consumers took a mixed approach to dressing for work perhaps reflecting a hybrid working situation. Pieces that could be dressed up for office days then styled more casually for working from home or for weekends proved popular. Both MS and John Lewis reported strong sales across their dress categories. MS sold over 400000 of its tiered dresses ranging from 25 to 45 and available in myriad colourways and prints. With a round neckline and falling midcalf on the website it is pictured styled with formal boots court heels and casual trainers. John Lewis 59 floral printed archive dress was a bestseller in green. It has since been repeated in pink. Meanwhile Jigsaw reported strong sales of suiting with both magenta and velvet twopieces performing well. A singlebreasted black velvet blazer 278 was in Reiss top three selling products. Because of the cost of living people dont want to spend money on casual pieces. They want investment pieces and things they can wear that make them feel good said Jigsaws creative director Jo Sykes. Its magenta tuxedo suit with satintrimmed trousers first hit stores in November 2021. That drop sold out in less than four hours. This summer there was a waiting list of over 1600 for it to arrive. Sykes said sales of standout tailoring were up 30 year on year at Jigsaw and were outperforming classic suiting lines Theres a whole trend of wearing standout suits from day to night. Customers are also styling the jackets and trousers separately. Google has reported that searches for wideleg trousers reached their highest recorded level in 2022. This is reflected at MS with over 190k sales of its sidestriped version. Available in petite regular and long spanning sizes 6 to 20 and in a variety of colours including grey and blue they retail for 39. 50. The bestselling jeans at the luxury etailer NetaPorter proved to be highrise with a straight cut leg. Versions from brands including Khaite Citizens of Humanity and Agolde were in the top five. Zipfront ankle boots from the Row were top sellers at both NetaPorter and Matches Fashion. First appearing on the runway in its autumnwinter 19 collection the leather boots with a chunky rubber retail for 1300 are regularly pictured on street style stars. At the cheaper end of the scale a pair of 89. 99 cleatsole Chelsea boots appeared in Offices top sellers whilst Clarks said it had sold over 1000 pairs of its 130 Aprilia Chelsea boots in black in November alone. Its 135 lace up Rixle boots were also popular. Sneakerwise various retailers reported Converse New Balance and Veja as the bestselling brands.

22,Pope praises Pell for persevering in times of personal trials - Reuters,"Pope Francis on Wednesday praised late Australian Cardinal George Pell for persevering in trying times, a reference to when he spent more than a year in prison on child sexual abuse accusations before he was fully acquitted.",2023-01-11T12:24:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/pope-praises-pell-persevering-times-personal-trials-2023-01-11/,Pope praises Pell for persevering in times of personal trials VATICAN CITY Jan 11 Reuters Pope Francis on Wednesday praised late Australian Cardinal George Pell for persevering in trying times a reference to when he spent more than a year in prison on child sexual abuse accusations before he was fully acquitted. Francis in an Italianlanguage message sent to the dean of the College of Cardinals also thanked Pell who served as the Holy Sees economy minister for laying the groundwork for financial reform in the Vatican with determination and wisdom. Pell a leading Catholic conservative died on Tuesday night in Rome of cardiac arrest while in a hospital for hip replacement surgery. He was 81. In his message to the dean Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re Francis said he was saddened by the news of Pells sudden death. Francis called Pell who always maintained his innocence a faithful servant who without vacillating followed his Lord with perseverance even in the hour of trial. The pope said he was grateful for Pells coherent and committed dedication to the Church. Church sources in Rome said Pells body would most likely lie in state in a side chapel in St. Peters Basilica ahead of requiem Mass there probably on Friday. Traditionally the dean of cardinals in this case Re says the funeral Mass and then the pope arrives at the end to give the final blessing. SNAP an advocacy group for victims of clergy sexual abuse in a statement called on the Vatican to show restraint in funeral arrangements unless the Church hierarchy wants to deepen already deep wounds. The Church in Australia has said that Pell will be buried in the crypt at St. Marys Cathedral in Sydney where Pell served as archbishop. MANY DARK MOMENTS An Australian appeals court ruling in 2020 quashed convictions that Pell sexually assaulted two choir boys in the 1990s. It allowed Pell to walk free after 13 months in prison ending the case of the most senior figure accused in the global scandal of historical sex abuse that has rocked the Roman Catholic Church worldwide. Look it was bad it wasnt like a holiday but I dont want to exaggerate how difficult that was. But there were many dark moments Pell who wrote a theevolume prison journal told Reuters in an interview in 2020. Pell said the lowest point in his prison ordeal was when his first appeal was rejected in August 2019. I was down. I was very disappointed. I came to be very cross he said. But I said my prayers and got on with things. Pell a former archbishop of Melbourne and Sydney was called by Pope Francis in 2014 to serve as Vatican economy minister a post he held until taking a leave of absence in 2017 to return to Australia to face the charges. At the Vatican he encountered much resistance from the old Italian guard to reforms he wanted to enact. In an interview with Reuters in July Pope Francis praised Pell as the genius who had insisted on an overarching method to control money flows and combat corruption. Even before the sexual assault accusations Pell was a polarising figure in the two decades that he dominated the Australian Catholic hierarchy revered by conservative Catholics for his staunch opposition to samesex marriage and womens ordination. He had been living in Rome since his acquittal and had several meetings with Pope Francis. Pell often attended the pontiffs Masses and Francis praised him publicly after his return. After his return to Rome Pell became a familiar face around the Vatican area even though he was retired. His home became a focal point for conservatives preparing their platform for the eventual election of Francis successor. Our Standards The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

EU government officials made the recommendation on Wednesday as Beijing plans to ease travel restrictions despite a wave of new COVID infections. The International Air Transport Association Airlines for Europe and ACI Europe in a joint statement said that the current surge of COVID19 cases in China is not expected to impact the epidemiological situation in the EUEEA European Economic Area and ran counter to an earlier assessment by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ECDC. The ECDC last week said EU citizens had relatively high vaccination levels and the potential for imported infections was low compared to daily infections in the EU with healthcare systems currently coping. China plans to ease travel restrictions on Sunday despite a wave of new infections that has left Chinese hospitals and funeral homes overwhelmed. Sweden and Germany on Thursday said they would implement the recommendations and more countries in the bloc are expected to do so soon. While it is regrettable that the recommendations agreed yesterday largely amount to a kneejerk reaction it is now vital that they are implemented by EU member states in a fully uniform manner the groups added in the statement. The groups said they hoped the EU would reassess the recommendations by midJanuary. Our Standards The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
24,Progressive Katie Porter launches bid for Dianne Feinstein’s US Senate seat,"Democratic congresswoman announces candidacy for seat held by Feinstein, 89, who has not yet said if she will retireDemocratic representative Katie Porter, the progressive former law professor known for her sharp questioning of witnesses and her use of a whit…",2023-01-10T18:45:21Z,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/10/katie-porter-democrat-california-us-senate,Democratic representative Katie Porter the progressive former law professor known for her sharp questioning of witnesses and her use of a whiteboard during hearings said she will seek the California Senate seat currently held by Dianne Feinstein. Feinstein a fellow Democrat is the oldest member of the chamber and has not yet said if she will retire. Especially in times like these California needs a warrior in Washington Porter said in a video posted on Twitter. Thats exactly why Im announcing my candidacy for the United States Senate in 2024. Porter was first elected to Congress in 2018 and won a tight race for reelection to her newly redrawn southern California district in November. She said in the video that she had challenged the status quo in Washington taking on big banks Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry. She wants to ban members of Congress from stock trading. To win these fights its time for new leadership in the US Senate she said. Feinstein 89 has faced questions about her age and memory and whether she will seek another term. She has not announced whether she will seek reelection in 2024 though she is widely expected to retire. Everyone is of course welcome to throw their hat in the ring and I will make an announcement concerning my plans for 2024 at the appropriate time Feinstein said in a statement on Tuesday. She added that she is currently focused on ensuring California has all the resources it needs to deal with deadly storms hitting the state. Feinstein won her sixth election in 2018 and has been a force for Democrats serving for a time as chair of the intelligence and judiciary committees. But she also has seen pushback from Democrats who view her as too bipartisan at a time when politics is more polarized and her state is increasingly liberal. In 2020 Feinstein announced she would step down as the top Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee. The move followed criticism that she was too friendly with Republicans during supreme court confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett. That included an embrace of the Republican chairman Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina at the conclusion of the hearings and kind words for what she called a job well done. Feinstein has defended her performance and said in 2021 that she planned to serve her full term even as there was open speculation and discussion about the future of the seat. Governor Gavin Newson said in 2021 that he would appoint a Black woman to replace Feinstein who is white if she were to retire early. Porter 49 was a consumer protection attorney before her election to the House and she has earned a reputation for her tough questioning of chief executives and other witnesses at congressional hearings often using a whiteboard to break down information. Porters media savvy was again on display during the recent meltdown in the US House over the election of a new speaker. As Republicans argued Porter was seen sitting in the chamber disinterestedly reading a book on the subtle art of not caring about whats happening.

26,NYU's Wagner Grad School to compile 'after-action report' on Buffalo snow response,"After a blizzard left 39 dead, the City of Buffalo announced that New York University will conduct an “after-action report” about the region’s response to the storm.",2023-01-02T15:27:59Z,https://abcnews.go.com/US/nyu-review-buffalos-blizzard-response-after-storm-leaves/story?id=96072597,After a blizzard left 39 people dead across New Yorks Erie County the City of Buffalo announced that New York University will conduct an afteraction report about the regions response to the storm according to Buffalo Mayor Bryon Brown. NYUs Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service will review the storm preparation response and recovery to outline best practices for other major cities as well as offer Buffalo feedback according to Brown. The City of Buffalo is resolved to learn from this storm and make additional improvements in how we respond to future extreme winter snow storms Brown wrote in a statement. The deadly blizzard devastated the region killing at least 39 requiring residents to stay off roads for nearly a week and cutting off residents from emergency services at the storms peak. There is no guarantee that in a life threatening emergency situation that theyre going to be able to respond immediately Erie County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz said at a Dec. 24 press conference adding that the most affected areas would have no emergency services at all. At the time of the press conference twothirds of emergency vehicles were stuck in the snow. Nobody would come. As the New York National Guard including military police moved to Buffalo to help with recovery efforts many residents were left to fend for themselves and their communities. Nobody would come Buffalo resident Tayron Knight said when explaining how he got stuck on Niagara Falls Boulevard. I called the police numerous times the police told me I was on a waiting list that they couldnt see nobody out. Another resident Eddie Porter explained how he got stuck on the road during the storm for 28 hours. His calls to police were left unanswered he said. He noted that he called police on Dec. 23 and eventually heard back on Dec. 29. You ever felt that youre going to die and you cant do nothing about it I thought it was over like it was going to be You ever felt that youre going to die and you cant do nothing about it Porter asked in an emotional interview with ABC News. Instead of being rescued by police Porter was rescued by William Kless a local resident who spent days saving an estimated fifty residents on his snowmobile. If he hadnt been there I dont know what I was gonna do Porter said. In an interview with ABC News Kless said he ended up helping residents get to shelters transporting dogs and cats transporting supplies and even helping a man get critical dialysis treatments after being stuck in his car for 17 hours. In person over social media or via calls with police Kless learned information about the needs in the community and offered doortodoor to help he said. There were so many calls that emergency services were canceled you know theres so many people left helpless not realizing when theyre going to be able to get help Kless said. Kless added that he communicated with Buffalo police when they could not safely get to a location with their vehicles. It was just like a search and rescue he said. The Buffalo police were involved because they couldnt get down on the streets. During a Dec. 24 press conference Poloncarz flagged the lack of vehicle mobility as an issue since the county city and state lacked snowmobiles and relied on traditional emergency response vehicles and National Guard Humvees. Knight said he was eventually rescued by a friend after which he began to work with friends and family to coordinate rescues in the absence of emergency services. We started going around helping everybody in the city of Buffalo as many people as we can Knight said. We had put up our numbers so if anybody that was trapped or had no power or in desperate need of emergency if they needed any help that wasnt getting any help from the city of Buffalo they could give us a call. Knight estimated they received hundreds of calls to the point where they had to triage responses based on the highestpriority emergencies. Looking back on their experience with the storm Kless Knight and Porter each flagged issues with the citys response. We didnt see any paramedics any police any firemen any emergency response teams at all Kless said. It was literally they didnt come out till about the day after once the storm and everything calmed down. Porter added that he was frustrated by the lack of emergency response in some communities within Buffalo believing the city dropped the ball for the east side a largely African American area where casualties from the storm were common. Lets be clear that was one of the reasons it was so tragic. Porter said Knight said he believes that not only should Buffalo have been better prepared but that the city could have saved lives if it had its act together. They knew everything was happening days beforehand they were warned and knew how bad the storm was going to be he said. They should have had the right personnel on hand. At one point Poloncarz publicly called out Buffalo for its embarrassing response before eventually apologizing for his statements. Storm after storm after storm after storm the city unfortunately is the last one to be open. And that shouldnt be the case he said. Its embarrassing to tell the truth. He added that Erie County took over operations for one third of the city. Residents said theyve been left with traumatic repercussions of the storm an unprecedented death toll and feelings of regret about what could have been done regardless of who was to blame. Most of this could have been prevented as far as fatalities Knight said. ABC News Alex Faul Will McDuffie and Brian Hartman contributed to this report.

N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn. DE asked a U. S. judge to dismiss lawsuits by women who accused Jeffrey Epstein of sexual abuse and said the banks enabled and ignored red flags about the late financiers sex trafficking. The banks in papers filed on Friday night in Manhattan federal court said they did not participate in or benefit from sex trafficking by their former client and that the unnamed women failed to allege violations of a federal antitrafficking law. The banks also said they had no duty to protect the women from Epstein and did not cause his abuses requiring the dismissal of claims under a new law in New York that lets abuse victims sue even if statutes of limitations have expired. Jane Doe 1 is a survivor of Epsteins sexual abuse and she is entitled to justice but filed meritless claims against the wrong party JPMorgan said in its filing. A lawyer for the women says the facts as described in their complaints speak for themselves. We are disappointed in the banks continuing effort to avoid taking responsibility for their role in the expansion and perpetuation of Jeffrey Epsteins sex trafficking ring David Boies the lawyer said in a statement to Reuters. Both lawsuits seek classaction status and unspecified damages. They were filed on Nov. 24 by lawyers who have represented many Epstein accusers. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Epstein was a JPMorgan client from about 2000 to 2013 and a Deutsche Bank client from 2013 to 2018 court papers show. The JPMorgan plaintiff is a former ballet dancer who said Epstein abused and trafficked her from 2006 to 2013 while the Deutsche Bank plaintiff said she suffered from similar misconduct between 2003 and 2018. Both said numerous cash payments from the banks were used to pay Epsteins victims. New York states financial regulator in July 2020 fined Deutsche Bank 150 million over its relationship with Epstein. On Tuesday the U. S. Virgin Islands where Epstein had a home sued JPMorgan saying the bank turned a blind eye to his trafficking while providing banking services. The cases are Jane Doe 1 v Deutsche Bank AG et al U. S. District Court Southern District of New York No. 2210018 and Jane Doe 1 v JPMorgan Chase Co in the same court No. 2210019.

He was 72.",2022-12-21T14:38:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/steelers-franco-harris-who-made-immaculate-reception-dies-72-2022-12-21/,Franco Harris who made Immaculate Reception dies at 72 Dec 21 Reuters Franco Harris the Pittsburgh Steelers running back who caught what became known as the Immaculate Reception has died aged 72 the Pro Football Hall of Fame said on Wednesday. Harris rushed for 12120 yards in 13 NFL seasons and won four Super Bowl rings with the Steelers but it was a single catch off a ricocheted pass from Terry Bradshaw that turned into a gamewinning 60yard touchdown that is the signature moment in a Hall of Fame career. That catch on Dec. 23 1972 at Three Rivers Stadium helped the Steelers to their firstever playoff win a 137 victory over the Oakland Raiders and has become NFL folklore known by American gridiron fans as the Immaculate Reception. Pittsburgh is scheduled to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Immaculate Reception on Saturday when the Steelers host the Las Vegas Raiders on Christmas Eve when Harriss famous number 32 is to be retired. We have lost an incredible football player an incredible ambassador to the Hall and most importantly we have lost one of the finest gentlemen anyone will ever meet Hall of Fame president Jim Porter said in a statement. Harris was first selection for the Steelers in the 1972 draft and quickly established himself as one of the NFLs best running backs rushing for more than 1000 yards to claim rookie of the year honours. He rushed for 1000 yards or more eight times and more than 100 yards in 47 games earning nine selections to the Pro Bowl. It is difficult to find the appropriate words to describe Franco Harris impact on the Pittsburgh Steelers his team mates the city of Pittsburgh and Steelers Nations said Steelers president Art Rooney II. From his rookie season that included the Immaculate Reception through the next 50 years Franco brought joy to people on and off the field. STEELERS DYNASTY Harris was a cornerstone of the Steelers dynasty that won four Super Bowls in the 1970s. In Super Bowl IX when the Steelers won their firstever league title with a 166 victory over Minnesota Harris rushed for 158 yards compared to 17 yards for the entire Viking team. He was named the games Most Valuable Player. He meant so much to Steelers fans as the Hall of Fame running back who helped form the nucleus of the teams dynasty of the 70s but he was much more NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. Franco changed the way people thought of the Steelers of Pittsburgh and of the NFL. Harriss death triggered an outpouring of grief across the worlds of sport entertainment and politics. President Joe Biden recalled that after the car crash 50 years ago that killed his first wife and infant daughter and badly injured his two young sons Harris and other Steelers players came to the hospital. Say the name Franco Harris and most everyone talks about the catch the Super Bowls and the glory he brought to the game of football Biden said. But in the fifty years we bonded as friends I always talked about his character and compassion. I know there will also be countless families like mine that will remember him for all that he did to lift our spirits when we needed it in the most quiet personal and American of ways.
