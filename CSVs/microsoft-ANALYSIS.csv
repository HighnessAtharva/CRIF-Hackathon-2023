So instead of ordering more of the current model the government approved 40 million for Microsoft to develop a new version. The updated combat goggles will address test results from last year when 70 soldiers wore the current version during three 72hour scenarios simulating combat conditions. The results showed that the soldiers suffered headaches eyestrain and nausea and that the system had too many failures of essential functions. In addition more than 80 percent of soldiers who reported discomfort began experiencing it less than three hours into the 72 hours test. The Army had initially requested 400 million to buy up to 6900 pairs of the goggles as part of the 1. 75 trillion government funding bill. Instead Congress approved 40 million from that sum to develop the new version. The Army has already given Microsoft 125 million to create a revised model and it still plans to spend up to 21. 9 billion over the next decade for as many as 121000 devices. The Department of Defense contract has significantly boosted Microsofts ability to profit from its AR device. Before working with the DoD the company had marketed the headset for enterprise manufacturing training and other industrial purposes. Although Microsoft has hinted at an eventual consumer version of HoloLens the company hasnt yet announced any specifics and its plans are hazier after the company has reportedly struggled to form a coherent strategy for its headset.,Microsoft and FTC pre-trial hearing set for January 3rd,Somewhat Positive,30,"['harm', 'concessions', 'burden', 'worse']",[],"[Holly, Vedova]"

Now it may be introducing an even bigger feature judging by a leak from a senior Microsoft product manager spotted by The Verge. Notepad in Windows 11 now has tabs the person said on Twitter before the tweet was deleted several minutes later. The screenshot included in the tweet shows two tabs along with a note confidential dont discuss features or take screenshots. That warning clearly failed to do the job but the screenshot indicates that tabs are in testing and may arrive to Windows Insiders sometime down the road. Given how much we all depend on tabs in web browsers its hard to believe theyre not more ubiquitous on other apps. Microsoft added that feature to File Explorer on Windows 11 earlier this year helping reduce the sprawl across screens when youre searching or copying files. The company did test tabs for Windows 10 apps some years ago but essentially abandoned that project. Notepad is an old app to say the least having arrived in 1983 to help Microsoft sell people on using a mouse in MSDOS. Considering its largely the same plain text editor it was two decades ago its amazing its still used as much as it is. If youre using Notepad so much that you need tabs my hats off to you but the feature is just a rumor until we see it released into the wild.,Congress blocks purchase of more Microsoft combat goggles,Extremely Negative,240,"['suffered', 'headaches', 'failures', 'discomfort', 'struggled']",[],[]

Microsoft formally recognized ZeniMax Workers UnitedCWA alongside todays vote results making this the largest union in the video game industry and the first US union at Microsoft overall. About 300 ZeniMax staff members were involved in the unionization effort which was brewing for months before going public in early December. This was around the time QA testers at another major video game studio Blizzard Albany voted to unionize with CWA. The Blizzard Albany union is the second at parent company Activision Blizzard after QA staff at Raven Software voted to organize in May 2022. The employees behind ZeniMax Workers UnitedCWA argue that the union will help put an end to sudden periods of crunch make pay more equitable and improve communication with management among other workplace benefits. ZeniMax Studios specializes in online experiences and is responsible for Elder Scrolls Online.

It pushed back against the agencys claims that the takeover would harm competition in the gaming industry. The company argued that consumers would benefit. The commission cannot meet its burden of showing that the transaction would leave consumers worse off because the transaction will allow consumers to play Activisions games on new platforms and access them in new and more affordable ways Microsoft wrote. The FTC asserted earlier this month that should the deal close it would enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloudgaming business. The agency pointed to Microsoft making some titles from Bethesda whose parent company ZeniMax it bought last year exclusive to its own platforms. In the filing Microsoft acknowledged that it planned to make three future Bethesda titles exclusive to Xbox and PC. The names of those games were redacted but and One of the major sticking points about the deal is the future of. In an attempt to appease regulators Microsoft has pledged to for at least 10 years if the acquisition closes and to. Sony hasnt taken Microsoft up on that deal however. The acquisition of a single game by the thirdplace console manufacturer cannot upend a highly competitive industry. That is particularly so when the manufacturer has made clear it will not withhold the game Microsoft wrote. The fact that Xboxs dominant competitor has thus far refused to accept Xboxs proposal does not justify blocking a transaction that will benefit consumers. Microsoft and Activision Blizzard both claim that keeping Call of Duty away from other platforms wouldnt make sense. Activision said in its own filing that making the franchise exclusive would be disastrous for Xbox as it would lose billions in game sales and give up a massive portion of the gamers that Activision has worked so hard to attract and retain. It added that in a world with nearly unlimited gaming alternatives making Call of Duty exclusive is not a plausible outcome. Both companies took issue with the FTC with Microsoft claiming that its procedures are unconstitutional. The structure of these administrative proceedings in which the commission both initiates and finally adjudicates the complaint against Microsoft violates Microsofts Fifth Amendment Due Process right to adjudication before a neutral arbiter Microsoft said in reference to the agencys decision to file the complaint in its own administrative court rather than in a federal one. The company also argued that hearing the case in the FTCs administrative court violates Article III of the US Constitution and the separation of powers. Activision asserted that by disregarding the supposed benefits to consumers and focusing on supposed harms to Xboxs deeppocketed competitors the FTC was straying from the underlying purpose of antitrust laws to protect competition instead of competitors. It said the agency was blinded by ideological skepticism of highvalue technology deals and by complaints from competitors and that it lost sight of the realities of the intensely competitive gaming industry. Nevertheless Microsoft wants to agree on conditions with the FTC and other regulators that will lead to them rubberstamping the deal. Even with confidence in our case we remain committed to creative solutions with regulators that will protect competition consumers and workers in the tech sector. As weve learned from our lawsuits in the past the door never closes on the opportunity to find an agreement that can benefit everyone Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith said. There is no sensible legitimate reason for our transaction to be prevented from closing. Our industry has enormous competition and few barriers to entry. We have seen more devices than ever before enabling players a wide range of choices to play games Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said in a statement to Engadget. Engines and tools are freely available to developers large and small. The breadth of distribution options for games has never been more widespread. We believe we will prevail on the merits of the case. The deadline for the acquisition to close is in July. If it hasnt done so by then Microsoft and Activision will need to renegotiate the deal or abandon it Microsoft would then face a breakup fee of as much as 3 billion. As The proposed acquisition is also facing scrutiny from regulators and.

Its now possible to download the apps from the Microsoft Store along with another preview app called Apple Devices that lets you manage Apple devices from your Windows PC according to the description. At its 2022 Surface event Microsoft announced that the apps would be coming to Windows 11 this year so the news isnt a huge surprise. Apples standalone Windows media apps have been a long time coming it was recruiting engineers to build them as far back as 2019.

Apple Music is missing the lyrics feature but is otherwise the same as the macOS version. As for Apple Devices it also replaces iTunes for sync and backup. Itll allow you to back up Apple devices sync local media and restore firmware without the need for iTunes. When launching them for the first time youll be warned that iTunes for Windows will stop working you need to uninstall the apps to continue using iTunes.

Barack Obama was president Avatar was soon to hit movie theaters and swine flu was officially declared a global pandemic. The world has changed a lot since then for example Avatar 2 is set in the water instead of the forest and so has Windows. While Microsoft officially ended support for Windows 7 on Jan. 14 2020 this week its truly officially dead. If youre still using it or Windows 8. 1 for that matter you really shouldnt be. As reported by Bleeping Computer Microsoft will pull the plug on software support for the Extended Security Update ESU program for Windows 7 on Tuesday Jan. 10. This program provided a threeyear paid exception to Microsofts abandoning of Windows 7 for Professional and Enterprise users who relied on the operating system to run specific software. As of this week however even ESU customers will find their versions of Windows 7 as unsupported as the rest. Its not only Windows 7 whose time is up Microsoft is also officially dropping extended support for Windows 8. 1 which came out in October 2013. In addition many thirdparty developers are likewise dropping support for aging versions of Windows. Google is ending Chrome support for Windows 7 and 8. 1 on Tuesday and Microsoft Edge 109 will be these Windows versions last Edge update too. What it means when an operating system is no longer supported When a developer like Microsoft drops support for its own software it doesnt mean the software itself stops working. After Tuesday youll still be able to boot up PCs running Windows 7 or 8. 1 and more than likely it will run the same way it ran on Monday. The same goes for Chrome and Edge. However the issue isnt really that Microsoft is done adding new features to Windows 7 that ship sailed long ago. Rather the problem is the company will no longer issue new security patches which makes running Windows 7 and 8. 1 particularly dangerous in 2023. Security patches are a necessary part of digital life. Software is inherently flawed and those flaws are eventually discovered by developers researchers or bad actors. If the wrong people figure out how to exploit those flaws against users it can empower them to take over your computer and steal your data or hold it for ransom. While these risks exist with any OS developers are typically diligent about patching vulnerabilities as theyre discovereda security hole isnt any good to a hacker if their victims can patch it up with the latest software update. But if those updates are never comingwhich is now the case with Windows 7 and 8. 1its open season for hackers looking for an easy mark. Too many of us have a habit of throwing out perfectly good tech before its time. Many of us could do with holding onto our phones and computers for an extra year or two or more. But Windows 7 had a very good run technologically speaking and the sad truth is after nearly 13 years it is officially unsafe for everyone to use. And seeing as roughly 11 of the computers in the world are still running it its going to be a rough transition going forward.,Apple TV and Apple Music apps quietly appear on the Microsoft Store,Extremely Positive,20,"['warned', 'bad']",[],[Thurrott]

When it comes to faking your voice thats a different story as Microsoft researchers recently revealed a new AI tool that can simulate someones voice using just a threesecond sample of them talking. The new tool a neural codec language model called VALLE is built on Metas EnCodec audio compression technology revealed late last year which uses AI to compress betterthanCD quality audio to data rates 10 times smaller than even MP3 files without a noticeable loss in quality. Meta envisioned EnCodec as a way to improve the quality of phone calls in areas with spotty cellular coverage or as a way to reduce bandwidth demands for music streaming services but Microsoft is leveraging the technology as a way to make text to speech synthesis sound more realistic based on a very limited source sample. Current text to speech systems are able to produce very realistic sounding voices which is why smart assistants sound so authentic despite their verbal responses being generated on the fly. But they require highquality and very clean training data which is usually captured in a recording studio with professional equipment. Microsofts approach makes VALLE capable of simulating almost anyones voice without them spending weeks in a studio. Instead the tool was trained using Metas Librilight dataset which contains 60000 hours of recorded English language speech from over 7000 unique speakers extracted and processed from LibriVox audiobooks which are all public domain. Microsoft has shared an extensive collection of VALLE generated samples so you can hear for yourself how capable its voice simulation capabilities are but the results are currently a mixed bag. The tool occasionally has trouble recreating accents including even subtle ones from source samples where the speaker sounds Irish and its ability to change up the emotion of a given phrase is sometimes laughable. But more often than not the VALLE generated samples sound natural warm and are almost impossible to distinguish from the original speakers in the three second source clips. In its current form trained on Librilight VALLE is limited to simulating speech in English and while its performance is not yet flawless it will undoubtedly improve as its sample dataset is further expanded. However it will be up to Microsofts researchers to improve VALLE as the team isnt releasing the tools source code. In a recently released research paper detailing the development of VALLE its creators fully understand the risks it poses Since VALLE could synthesize speech that maintains speaker identity it may carry potential risks in misuse of the model such as spoofing voice identification or impersonating a specific speaker. To mitigate such risks it is possible to build a detection model to discriminate whether an audio clip was synthesized by VALLE. We will also put Microsoft AI Principles into practice when further developing the models.,Windows 7 Is Officially Dead,Extremely Negative,410,"['dead', 'unsupported', 'issue', 'problem', 'issue', 'dangerous', 'bad', 'wrong', 'exploit', 'steal', 'risks', 'sad', 'unsafe', 'rough']",['hole'],"[Barack, Obama, 'lawsuit']"

Microsoft already invested 1 billion in parent OpenAI back in 2019 and its reportedly in talks to invest another 10 billion. This strategic investment is a smart poker move in this AI arms race that is taking place globally Ives said. Microsoft could reinvent itself if it moves ahead with a large investment in OpenAI the company behind the wildly popular ChatGPT chatbot that launched late last year. Thats according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives who said in a Wednesday note that Microsofts reported plans to invest up to 10 billion into OpenAI would help turn Microsoft into a core AI stock. With ChatGPT being one of the most innovative AI technologies seen in the industry Microsoft is clearly being aggressive on this front and not going to be left behind on what could be a potential game changing AI investment Ives said. Microsoft already invested 1 billion in OpenAI back in 2019 and now the software giant is reportedly in talks to invest another 10 billion in the company at a 29 billion valuation. Such an investment would reportedly net Microsoft 75 of OpenAIs profits until it recoups its investment. From there Microsoft would hold 49 ownership of OpenAI if the reported deal is completed. According to Ives Microsoft has plenty of opportunities to integrate the technology of ChatGPT across its portfolio of products including its Bing search engine Microsoft Office products and Azure cloud platform. Over time and if successful Bing could even take some search market share away from Google according to the note. Whats important according to Ives is that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella doesnt repeat the same mistakes made by Microsoft during the late 1990s when it was embroiled in an antitrust battle with the US government. That situation slowed down Microsofts investing vision and led to the company missing out on big trends like social media and mobile smartphones. Nadella is not going to repeat the same mistakes and we believe this strategic investment is a smart poker move in this AI arms race that is taking place globally Ives said. Ives continues to rate Microsoft at Outperform with a 290 price target representing potential upside of 24 from current levels.,Microsoft's New AI Tool Just Needs to Hear Three Seconds of Your Voice to Mimic You,Extremely Positive,160,"['loss', 'spotty', 'limited', 'trouble', 'laughable', 'impossible', 'limited', 'risks', 'risks', 'misuse', 'risks', 'discriminate']",[],['harassment']
9,Microsoft events to show new slate of games—including Starfield,"Starfield will be shown separately from the other games, though.",https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/microsoft-events-to-show-new-slate-of-games-including-starfield/,Today Microsoft announced an upcoming livestream called DeveloperDirect that will include looks at several upcoming games from the companys nownumerous development studios. Set for January 25 at 3 pm ET the company promises glimpses at Redfall the latest game from Dishonoredand Preydeveloper Arkanewhose pedigree actually goes all the way back to influential PC classics like System Shockand Ultima Underworld. It will also include glimpses at games from other studios including Minecraft Legends Forza Motorsport and The Elder Scrolls Online. Notably absent from that list is the game that most people probably want to see Starfield the sciencefiction epic from The Elder Scrolls and Fallout developer Bethesda Game Studios. If thats your interest though dont worryMicrosoft also announced that Starfield would get a standalone event for a deep dive in the near future. Starfield is expected to launch sometime in the first half of this year but we havent seen much from it since last summer apart from a couple of short and mostly detaillight videos on the games YouTube channel. As for the games being shown on January 25 Microsoft says there will be several minutes of gameplay from Redfall which is a vampirethemed firstperson shooter that seems to combine elements of the Far Cry series and coop shooter Left 4 Dead among other things. Fans can expect to learn more about combat customization bosses the open world and more Microsofts blog post says. Gameplay is promised for Minecraft Legends and Forza Motorsport. Finally The Elder Scrolls Onlines annual update cycle will continue with new details about 2023s major chapter update and the latest regions of Tamriel to become playable. For years the gaming industry was dominated by a handful of press conferences around the E3 event in the summer. But companies like Nintendo have more recently refocused on studioshot online video streams throughout the year allowing games to be shown in a cadence that better fits those games development cycles. In the past studios often wasted numerous work hours preparing E3 demos for June whether the timing made sense or not which led to lost development time long hours and sometimes unrepresentative demos. Microsoft has typically stuck to an E3like cadence though even as rivals Nintendo and Sony have moved to the sporadic livestream model that has been dubbed the direct strategy. This event seems to be one of Microsofts most significant moves in the new direction. The timing makes sense Microsoft has been on a studio and publisher shopping spree for the past few years and it now has an unrivaled amount of storied studios and intellectual properties under its wing including Bethesda Arkane Obsidian Rare and many othersincluding all Activision Blizzard studios should the proposed megaacquisition go through. These acquisitions follow many years when Microsoft lagged behind rivals in terms of inhouse exclusive content for its gaming platforms. Theres one last bit of relevant added context too Microsoft has gone allin on a Netflixlike subscription model with Game Pass bundling an everchanging library of first and thirdparty titles some exclusive some not in subscription packages for Xbox consoles and Windows PCs. Its likely that most if not all of the games shown at the upcoming DeveloperDirect stream will be included on Game Pass.,"ChatGPT could be a 'game changer' for Microsoft that turns it into a core AI stock as it mulls a $10 billion investment into OpenAI, Wedbush says",Extremely Negative,240,"['aggressive', 'mistakes', 'embroiled', 'slowed', 'mistakes']",[],"[Dan, Ives, Ives, Dan, Ives, Ives, Ives, Ives, Satya, Nadella, Nadella, Ives, Ives]"

Please specify which partial exclusivity strategy or strategies you believe Microsoft would have the ability to deploy with respect to Activision Blizzards console games after Microsofts acquisition of Activision Blizzard the questionnaire asked. The EU antitrust watchdog asked if such strategies would include degrading the quality or interoperability of Activisions games available on competing consoles or providing upgrades to Activisions games only on Xbox. Other options were raising the wholesale price of Activisions games for distribution on competing consoles and making them available on competing consoles at a later date. Companies were also asked if Microsoft would make some of Activisions gaming content and features exclusively available only on Xbox but not on competing consoles. The document also included a question about Activisions Call of Duty asking which video game franchise is considered the most important for a console game distributor to offer and what other main alternatives there are to Call of Duty. Regulators asked what advantages and disadvantages game developers and publishers and console game distributors would face if a game is distributed exclusively on one console. They also wanted to know the impact for competition between cloud game streaming services if the combined Activision portfolio were to become available as part of such a service. Rival providers of PC operating systems were asked if Microsoft would have the technical ability to prevent Activisions games from being compatible with nonWindows operating systems. Microsoft said it continues to work with the Commission to address any valid marketplace concerns.

S. judge in California to pause a private antitrust lawsuit over the companys 69 billion bid to buy Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard Inc while a related U. S. regulatory action challenging the deal moves ahead. Lawyers for Microsoft argued in a filing in San Francisco federal district court that freezing the private consumers case would avoid needless and duplicative litigation and the risk of inconsistent rulings on identical issues. The consumer lawsuit on behalf of 10 video game players alleging Microsofts purchase of Activision would reduce competition in the video game industry came about two weeks after the U. S. Federal Trade Commission filed its own case at the agency. There is accordingly no reason to litigate this case right now. Microsoft is already litigating the issues presented here in front of the FTC Microsofts lawyers at Wilkinson Stekloff and Alston Bird told U. S. District Judge Jacqueline Corley. The private case seeks a preliminary injunction blocking the purchase. The FTC has not yet filed any lawsuit in federal court. Its case is moving ahead in an administrative forum at the agency where a judge has the power to enjoin the proposed tieup. A hearing is scheduled for August. Microsoft and its lawyers have defended the bid to buy Activision saying the purchase would provide consumers highquality content in more ways and at lower prices. The deal also faces competition scrutiny in the EU and United Kingdom. Lawyers for Microsoft in the California case did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. A Microsoft spokesperson in a statement said since the claims raised in the private case are already being litigated by the FTC it makes sense to pause this private litigation. Plaintiffs attorney Joseph Saveri told Reuters that Microsoft hasnt provided any sound basis for stopping our case and that any halt to the litigation would run counter to what he said was a negotiated schedule letting the dispute move forward. The FTC declined to comment. In December the agency said it sued to stop Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio. The proposed merger would harm competition among rival gaming platforms from Nintendo Co Ltd and Sony Group Corp the FTC said. Microsoft said in Wednesdays filing in the private consumers case that it and Activision have cooperated with the FTC and international counterparts to obtain regulatory approval for the deal. Attorneys for Microsoft argued there is no risk of harm in staying plaintiffs case while those regulatory proceedings are ongoing. The transaction agreement has a termination date of July 18.

He said he is now cancerfree. Microsofts current litigation head Jon Palmer said in a statement that Howard had an enormous positive impact and the company looks forward to working with him at Morgan Lewis. Howard previously led the white collar and securities litigation practice at law firm Dechert before joining Microsoft in 2010 to lead the litigation team oversee internal investigations and regulatory enforcement matters globally the firm said. He also worked as a federal prosecutor and as an attorney on the White House Counsels task force on the IranContra matter.

Deere Company has signed a memorandum of understanding with the American Farm Bureau Federation AFBF that lets US farmers and independent repair shops fix equipment rather than requiring the use of authorized parts and service centers. Users will have access to official diagnostics manuals tools and training. Deere will let owners disable electronic locks and wont bar people from legally obtaining repair resources even if the company no longer offers them. The agreement includes some protections for the equipment maker. John Deere wont be required to divulge trade secrets or to allow repairs that might disable emissions controls remove safety features or modify power levels. Unsurprisingly fixes also cant violate the law. The memorandum is effective as of January 8th although John Deere didnt detail exactly how or when it would alter its practices. Weve asked the company for comment. In a statement senior VP Dave Gilmore said the company was looking forward to working with customers and the ABFB in the months and years ahead to provide repair facilities. The pact is characterized as a voluntary private arrangement. However it comes alongside mounting political pressure that effectively gave John Deere little choice but to improve repairability. President Biden ordered the Federal Trade Commission to draft right to repair regulation in 2021 while states like New York have passed their own sometimes weakened legislation. If Deere doesnt act it risks legal battles that could limit where and how it does business in the country. As it stands the farm equipment maker isnt alone in responding to government action.

But what if the technology is doing more harm than good As increasing numbers of companies rely on artificial intelligence to power their tech we see more cases of dangerous AI dysfunction like autopilot car crashes or content moderation bots promoting harmful social media posts. These conflicts will start to play out in the legal system in 2023 helping define the role of AI in our society going forward. What were waiting for Programmers filed a class action lawsuit against Microsoft and several of its subsidiaries in December for utilizing AIgenerated software that borrowed from existing code on the internet without crediting the creator. According to the lawsuit Microsoft subsidiary Copilot which owns the AIgenerated software ignores violates and removes the Licenses offered by thousandspossibly millionsof software developers thereby accomplishing software piracy on an unprecedented scale. A trial date has not yet been set but the case is likely to be a landmark one and help determine the limits of AI learning. An AI is acting as a legal assistant in an upcoming court case for a speeding ticket. The robot will speak to the defendant through an earpiece to direct them on what to say throughout the case. The AI bot was developed by San Franciscobased startup DoNotPay which says if the AI process doesnt work it will cover all potential fines.

Unconventional wisdom Langdon Winner the author of the book Autonomous Technology describes the chain of reciprocal dependency the fact that despite any autonomy disparities between humans and technology our reliance on it will continue to grow despite experiences detailing the harmful and often irreversible consequences. Winner says that the implementation of this technology has repeatedly confounded our vision our expectations and our capacity to make intelligent judgments meaning our choices and arguments have changed and that the patterns of perceptive thinking that were entirely reliable in the past now lead us systematically astray. In other words autonomy is clouding our judgment making us weaker not stronger.

23,Why a $67bn takeover could make Microsoft a gaming behemoth,"With the acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard in the works, the company is facing investigations by trade commissions the world over. If the deal goes through, could it help the forgotten tech giant gain new relevance?<ul><li>Don’t get TechScape …",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/03/why-a-67bn-takeover-could-make-microsoft-a-gaming-behemoth,Microsoft is the forgotten tech giant. Despite being the worlds secondlargest public company by market capitalisation it got left out of the snappy acronym for the big five FAANG alongside Facebook Amazon Apple and Google in favour of Netflix a company seven percent its size. Even when you add them to the equation and GAFAM seems the most popular ordering though given Google and Facebooks rebrands to Alphabet and Meta it should really be MAMAA Microsoft has avoided the scrutiny its peers have been subjected to. Part of that is to do with where the companies make their profits. Microsofts consumer brands are large and popular but dont feel like unstoppable behemoths compared to the rest of the MAMAAs. Amazon towers over ecommerce Meta owns social networking Alphabet dominates web browsers email and search while Apple practically prints money with a phone that can credibly be called the most successful consumer product ever released. Microsoft though makes its money through enterprise sales and cloud computing and its unbroken power over desktop operating systems seems like a relic of the past rather than a meaningful focus of attention in the present. The company has been making the most of that state of affairs. Its president Brad Smith the second most powerful person at the company after chief executive Satya Nadella has gained a reputation for being the leader of the proregulation forces of the tech industry. When we met in the hazy past of 2019 he warned that the sector would soon feel the backlash of years of acting like if its legal its acceptable and a few months later he targeted Apple for taking a cut of up to 30 of all economic activity on the iPhone. The same strategy sees Microsoft lean in to the markets where it trails the competition endorsing policies and practices that cost it little but its competitors lots. In February 2021 Smith endorsed an Australian proposal requiring payments for news content accepting a small cost for Microsofts Bing to support a massive one for Google. Two months after that the company put pressure on Apple and its massive App Store profits by abolishing its own Windows app store fees. For a while the approach worked. Compare two acquisitions in 2021 Facebook tried to buy a VR developer called Within which makes a popular fitness app for Oculus called Supernatural. The deal was valued at just 400m a tiny amount for a Facebook acquisition but a large payout for a company with one major product in a fairly niche sector. Nonetheless the Federal Trade Commission FTC in the US sued to stop it in July this year arguing that Meta is trying to buy its way to the top. Just a few months before the Within acquisition however Microsoft had successfully pulled off a much bigger coup spending 7. 5bn to acquire ZeniMax the video game publisher that owns properties including Skyrim Doom and Fallout. The deal went off without a hitch giving Microsoft a flagship set of firstparty developers and hundreds of titles to offer for free to subscribers of its Xbox Game Pass service. Siren call Now though Microsofts nonstick coating is rubbing off. In January 2022 the company announced another planned acquisition and it was a monster a 68. 7bn cash purchase of Activision Blizzard the titan publisher of World of Warcraft Candy Crush Starcraft and Call of Duty. It clearly expected the acquisition to go through as smoothly as the ZeniMax purchase had. Despite the clear strategic benefits the purchase felt like an impulse buy taking advantage of a sinking stock price at the company following months of legal wrangling over a sexual harassment scandal as well as weak financial results from Activision Blizzard itself. Instead Microsoft found itself plunged into a morass of investigations the world over. The EU competition commission the UKs Competition and Markets Authority and the FTC have all started investigations into the takeover and in December the FTC moved to block it. The first pretrial hearing in that case starts today 3 January. The purchase isnt controversial just because of the cost of the buyout but also because of one game Call of Duty. The military shooter series is one of the most commercially successful game series of all time. Few other titles are guaranteed as many sales and those that are like Grand Theft Auto or The Legend of Zelda are rare entries in the release calendar averaging two or so publications a decade. Call of Duty by contrast is a machine that Activision has rebuilt itself to power. Three development studios rotate producing one new entry every year with a host of smaller units providing support in roles like asset creation and play testing and a new massively successful freetoplay Fortnite competitor Warzone bolted on top of the whole thing. The cinematic singleplayer campaigns are renowned for being interactive blockbusters but the multiplayer mode are where the series dominates. There are other benefits to buying the company. Microsoft could use King the Activision Blizzard subsidiary that makes Candy Crush to get a foothold in mobile gaming or take the nine million players who still subscribe to World of Warcraft and bring them into the Game Pass ecosystem. But at its heart the purchase is about Call of Duty and specifically Game Pass. Microsoft has been very clear about what its not trying to do. Its not trying to make Call of Duty an Xbox exclusive. The company has committed to signing a consent decree if the FTC will accept it which would bind it to offering the game on other platforms. And its already made a deal with Nintendo to bring the series to the Switch the first to be available on a Nintendo console since Ghosts in 2013. But speaking to industry insiders the fear on the part of Microsofts competitors chiefly Sony which makes the PlayStation isnt about exclusivity narrowly defined. Instead its about what happens to the industry if Xbox becomes the best place to play Call of Duty either because its developed for those platforms and ported to others halfheartedly or simply because its available for free with Game Pass on Xbox and for a 70 price tag on PlayStation. They worry that the centre of gravity of online gaming would gradually shift to Xbox first taking the Call of Duty players then taking the people who play other games with them and then taking anyone who plays games online at all. It might be hard to feel too sorry for Sony a company that indisputably is the market leader in home consoles and has used its heft to win battles before but regulators are paying attention. After half a decade of being the gentle giant everyone loves to forget might 2023 be the year Microsoft remembers why its competitors all live in fear of antitrust enforcement If you want to read the complete version of the newsletter please subscribe to receive TechScape in your inbox every Tuesday.,The Year Ahead in Autonomous Responsibility,Extremely Positive,300,"['breaking', 'numb', 'harm', 'dangerous', 'crashes', 'harmful', 'conflicts', 'limits', 'harmful', 'irreversible', 'confounded', 'astray', 'weaker', 'disastrous', 'harmful', 'bad']",[],"[Nikki, Main, 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', Langdon, Winner, Winner, Langdon, Winner, Madeleine, Clark, Elish, PJ, Rey, 'lawsuit']"
24,Ditching a dual-screen Surface Duo 3 for a foldable is a smart move for Microsoft,A report indicates Microsoft is reportedly giving up on the dual-screen form factor in favor of foldable displays.,https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/microsoft-reportedly-abandons-dual-screen-surface-duo-3-for-foldable,Ditching a dualscreen Surface Duo 3 for a foldable is a smart move for Microsoft The dualscreen form factor is pretty much dead. Microsoft may be done with the Surface Duo lineup as we now know it. The company has been the only major OEM to commit to the dualscreen form factor but the latest rumor indicates that the company is looking to switch things up with its next Surface Duo model. According to Windows Central Microsoft is abandoning the dualscreen form factor instead opting for a device with a foldable display. According to their source the company aims to build a phone that mimics some of the best foldable phones on the market with an internal folding display and an external cover screen. Apparently this new foldable phone will replace the dualscreen Surface Duo 3 that was reportedly set to launch at the end of 2023. Of course this news may disappoint Surface Duo fans who prefer having two separate displays over one singular folding panel. After all the former is arguably a more durable setup than the still fragile folding displays found in devices like the Galaxy Z Fold 4. And while I never used the device longterm I appreciated Microsofts efforts to continue carving out a space for the form factor that was seemingly underappreciated. Last year I wrote about how I would like to see more dualscreen phones on the market as an alternative to the largescreened foldables. Its a form factor LG tried to popularize with later device launches and one that only Microsoft seemed fully committed to. But with the news that Microsoft is possibly abandoning dual screens it seems like the form factor is pretty much dead at least for smartphones. Anshel Sag principal analyst at Moor Insights Strategy says dualscreen phones never really found their footing in a world increasingly focused on foldables. I think dual screens never really took off because except for Microsofts design they were pretty cumbersome and werent as sleek as a lot of foldables and the software was optimized for foldables not dualscreen devices. Windows Centrals Daniel Rubino who explained why he prefers the Surface Duo 2 over the Galaxy Z Fold 4 says while it may not be the desired course for Microsoft or its fans the decision to switch to a foldable display is a necessary one as it may make components easier to source by no longer relying on custom parts. A singlescreen foldable is clearly where the rest of the market is heading and Microsoft already has a massive uphill battle to convince consumers to buy its phone Rubino tells me. This change in design will lessen that burden and make this Surface phone more normal. The report also notes that Microsoft is looking into other form factors such as a more traditional slab smartphone which may boost its hardware efforts. Microsoft was unable to provide a comment on its plans for future Surface Duo models. Rubino explains that the Surface Duo community is relatively small compared to the growing number of consumers buying into Samsungs foldable phones. This is partly due to the Surface Duos position as more of a productivity device whereas Samsungs focus is more on entertainment which benefits from the large singular display. Contributing to the devices lackluster reception is the lack of a major marketing push from Microsoft which seemingly left its muchimproved Surface Duo 2 to linger on store shelves until it runs out of stock. Still I cant help but be disappointed by the idea of there no longer being a viable dualscreen option. The Surface Duo 2 is not a bad phone by any means. It features a pair of greatlooking OLED displays an upgraded triplecamera setup a functional stylus pen and a great software experience. That said it always seemed like Microsoft was playing catch up with each iteration of the Duo even though the Duo 2 minimized its technology gap with a nowaging Snapdragon 888 chipset. Fortunately the Surface Duo 2 seemed to lean on its great software experience which may be the case for the Surface foldable whatever it should be called. Windows Central notes that there is reportedly a larger software effort ongoing internally that aims to differentiate Microsofts foldable from the competition. Its not entirely what this looks like but it could blend Microsofts productivity features with an enhanced focus on media and entertainment. This effort reportedly dubbed Perfect Together not to be confused with Googles Better Together may also lean further into the growing connection between Android phones and Windows PCs something were seeing more of lately with devices like the Lenovo ThinkPhone by Motorola. One path that fans of Surface Duo are hoping Microsoft chooses is to implement a virtual dualscreenlike experience says Rubino. On Fold 4 a single screensingle app experience is the default with users optionally splitting the screen to have two adjacent apps. Instead Microsoft could set the default experience as running two apps side by side with users needing to drag the app to the center to span it. This is essentially what users experience now on current Duo models but the separation between screens would be solely softwarebased. Sag says that Microsoft has a chance to differentiate itself in a way that Samsung hasnt really taken advantage of. For Microsoft it would definitely have to come from AI capabilities and deeper integration with its existing products like Office 365 and Xbox xCloud. Samsung has already taken a lot of the Microsoft goodness with the Fold series so the best way to differentiate will have to be in places that Samsung hasnt like AI. With supposed plans to integrate ChatGPT into Bing Microsoft could definitely leverage this in its software. As for the UI we already saw a lot of improvements on the foldable front with the Android 12L update which introduced features like improved multitasking and a taskbar. On the Surface Duo the update included a more Windowslike UI and new pen functionality. Microsoft may just have to lean more into these improvements while walking the fine line between preserving the experience Surface Duo fans have come to love and creating a device that will appeal to more users. Phone deals opens in new tab Best Buy opens in new tab Walmart opens in new tab Samsung opens in new tab Amazon opens in new tab Verizon opens in new tab ATT For now theres no launch time frame for the new device but hopefully we wont have to wait long to see what Microsoft comes up with lest the company find itself falling even further behind.

The Information reported the news on Tuesday citing two people with direct knowledge of the plans. Microsoft could launch the new feature before the end of March in the hopes of challenging Googles search engine the Information reported. Microsoft said in a blog post last year that it planned to integrate imagegeneration software from its image creation software DallE 2 into Bing. OpenAI and Microsoft declined to comment. Microsoft had in 2019 backed San Franciscobased artificial intelligence company OpenAI offering 1bn in funding. The two had formed a multiyear partnership to develop artificial intelligence supercomputing technologies on Microsofts Azure cloud computing service. OpenAI made its latest creation ChatGPT chatbot available for free public testing on 30 November. The chatbot is a software application designed to mimic humanlike conversation based on user prompts and can respond to a large range of questions while imitating human speaking styles. The feature could make Bing more competitive to Googles search engine at a time when Alphabet its parent company has seen advertising revenue growth slow significantly. Advertising is Alphabets primary source of revenue the vast majority of which comes from search ads. Microsoft also saw its search and advertising growth rate slow down in the fourth quarter of the 2022 fiscal year. OpenAIs various products such ChatGPT the natural language system GPT3 and DallE 2 may still need work but have already been pegged as the industrys potential next disruptors. The former has reportedly led Google management to declare a code red according to the New York Times seeing the chat bot which answers questions or prompts with clear explanations instead of just links as a major threat to the way consumers currently use search engines. Google however has been hard at work on its own chat bot technology called Language Model for Dialogue Applications the sophistication of which led one Google engineer to claim it was sentient. He was placed on administrative leave after deciding to go public with his claims.

S. over US68. 7B Activision Blizzard deal Microsoft is headed for a battle with the Federal Trade Commission over whether the U. S. will block the tech giants planned takeover of video game company Activision Blizzard. Microsoft on Thursday filed a formal response to the FTCs claims that the US68. 7 billion deal is an illegal acquisition that should be stopped. After years of avoiding the political backlash that has been directed at big tech peers such as Amazon and Google the software giant now appears to be on a collision course with U. S. regulators emboldened by President Joe Bidens push to get tough on anticompetitive behavior. The FTC claims the merger could violate antitrust laws by suppressing competitors to Microsofts Xbox game console and its growing Xbox Game Pass subscription business. At the center of the dispute is Microsofts rivalry with PlayStationmaker Sony to secure popular Activision Blizzard franchises like the military shooter game Call of Duty. Microsofts response to the FTC tries to downplay Xboxs role in the industry describing itself as the thirdplace manufacturer of gaming consoles behind Sony and Nintendo and one of just many publishers of popular video games with next to no presence in mobile gaming where it is trying to make gains. Activision Blizzard filed its own rebuttal to the FTC complaint on Thursday criticizing what it described as the FTCs unfounded assumption that Microsoft would want to withhold Call of Duty from platforms that compete with Xbox. Its CEO Bobby Kotick said he believes the companies will prevail. The dispute could be a difficult test case for Bidenappointed FTC Chair Lina Khan who has sought to strengthen enforcement of antitrust rules. The FTC voted 31 earlier in December to issue the complaint seeking to block the deal with Khan and the two other Democratic commissioners voting in favor and the sole Republican voting against. The deal is also under close scrutiny in the European Union and the United Kingdom where investigations arent due to be completed until next year. The FTCs complaint points to Microsofts 2021 acquisition of wellknown game developer Bethesda Softworks and its parent company ZeniMax as an example of where Microsoft is making some upcoming game titles exclusive to Xbox despite assuring European regulators it had no intention to do so. Microsoft on Thursday objected to the FTCs characterization saying it made clear to European regulators it would approach exclusivity for future game titles on a casebycase basis which is exactly what it has done. The FTCs suit describes topselling franchises like Call of Duty as important because they develop a base of loyal users attached to their preferred console or streaming service. With control of Activisions content Microsoft would have the ability and increased incentive to withhold or degrade Activisions content in ways that substantially lessen competition including competition on product quality price and innovation the FTC lawsuit says. This loss of competition would likely result in significant harm to consumers in multiple markets at a pivotal time for the industry. Microsoft signaled that it will vigorously fight the case in court with a team led by highprofile corporate attorney Beth Wilkinson while also leaving open the possibility of a settlement. Even with confidence in our case we remain committed to creative solutions with regulators that will protect competition consumers and workers in the tech sector said Microsofts president Brad Smith in a statement Thursday. As weve learned from our lawsuits in the past the door never closes on the opportunity to find an agreement that can benefit everyone. Microsofts last big antitrust battle occurred more than two decades ago when a federal judge ordered its breakup following the companys anticompetitive actions related to its dominant Windows software. That verdict was overturned on appeal although the court imposed other penalties on the company. The FTCs decision to send the complaint to its inhouse Administrative Law Judge D. Michael Chappell instead of seeking an urgent federal court injunction to halt the merger could drag the case out at least until August when the first evidence hearing is scheduled. Microsofts agreement with Activision Blizzard requires it to pay the video game company a breakup fee of up to 3 billion if it cant close the deal before July 18. The timing and trajectory of the case could change depending on how regulators in the U. K. and Europe rule on the merger next year. If Microsoft wins approval in Europe it could use that to try to expedite the process in U. S. courts. The merger faced yet another challenge this week from a group of individual video game players who sued in a San Francisco federal court to stop the deal on antitrust grounds. The plaintiffs all fans of Activision Blizzards Call of Duty franchise and other popular titles such as World of Warcraft Overwatch and Diablo are particularly concerned about how the consolidation would affect future game quality innovation and output said their attorney Joseph Alioto. When theres a lack of competition the quality necessarily goes down Alioto said. By eliminating Activision it gives such a strong position to Microsoft that they can do whatever they want.

O is mulling a headsIwin tailsIalso win AI deal. A mooted 10 billion investment reported by Semafor in the maker of the popular ChatGPT could reshape Microsofts software business. Even if it flops CEO Satya Nadella will slow a rival and possibly regain much of its investment. The 29 billion price tag placed on OpenAI is high but defensible. The company aims to grow sales to 1 billion next year according to a Reuters report. That would value the firm at 29 times 2024 revenue. Enterprise software group Snowflake SNOW. N is trading at 13 times 2024 revenue but its growing nowhere near OpenAIs rate. And the investment is a pittance compared to Microsofts market capitalization of 1. 7 trillion and 107 billion of cash on hand. The financial potential of artificial intelligence though is vast and probably bigger than all current software spending. Designing a better search engine one that intuitively knows exactly what users are looking for would be a major threat to Google Owner Alphabets GOOGL. O 1. 1 trillion valuation. The next step could be AI programs that quickly write better software and design more effective drugs creating even bigger potential markets. Moreover the biggest uses for new IT platforms often emerge after experimentation in the wild. Of course the odds are OpenAI will fade away as most tech firms do. Even then Microsofts investment may not be wasted. Alphabet has spent about 100 billion on research and development betting hard on such products over the past three years alone and will grow its spending by 13 annually in the next three years Morgan Stanley reckons. By locking up a promising firm and scarce researchers Microsoft may prevent Alphabet from winning and may force it to raise spending. Clever dealmaking cuts Microsofts risk further. OpenAI already runs on Microsofts Azure cloud platform thanks to a 2019 agreement between the two. The proposed investment means OpenAI can grow its business faster which also benefits Azure a part of Microsoft that investors value highly. Furthermore the new agreement gives Microsoft 75 of OpenAIs profit until its investment is recouped. Tech bets may be coin flips but this one is worth taking.

28,Microsoft's investment into ChatGPT's creator may be the smartest $1 billion ever spent,"If OpenAI's models lives up to their promise, Microsoft has futureproofed its own business for decades.",https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-openai-investment-the-smartest-1-billion-ever-spent-2023-1,Microsofts investment into ChatGPTs creator may be the smartest 1 billion ever spent Microsofts 1 billion investment into OpenAI may be one of the shrewdest bets in tech history. OpenAI released AI bot ChatGPT and is in discussions to raise capital at a 30 billion valuation. It has looked over the past few months like Big Techs bull run is coming to end. As interest rates soar even cashrich tech companies are pulling back on risky expensive moonshots or moneylosing projects. But one speculative bet is increasingly looking like excellent value for money. In 2019 Microsoft invested 1 billion into the buzzy artificial intelligence research outfit OpenAI cofounded by Y Combinator alum Sam Altman Elon Musk and a group of others just over seven years ago. Financial details of the deal werent disclosed at the time but MIT Tech Review reported in 2020 that the 1 billion was split between cash and credits for Azure Microsofts cloud business. Insider has approached both firms for comment. In November OpenAI released a userfriendly bot ChatGPT based on its GPT3. 5 language model which was trained on Azure. Engineers academics entrepreneurs nontechies and investors were nearuniversal in their hype and praise as ChatGPT proved scarily intelligent up to a point. Even if flawed ChatGPT is sufficiently smart that Google sees the chatbot as a code red for its search business. Now OpenAI is reportedly in discussions to raise more capital at a valuation close to 30 billion up from a current 20 billion valuation and is in discussions with Peter Thielrun VC firm Founders Fund according to reports. The valuation would be cemented through a tender offer involving the sale of existing shares to investors. Apart from the ROI Microsofts deal only looks smarter as more details emerge. The Information reported that the company could integrate ChatGPT into Bing its flailing Google competitor. As Insiders Emilia David writes thats the first real threat to Googles search hegemony in two decades. ChatGPT could fuel growth for Bing and Azure Gil Luria director of research at DA Davidson an investment bank wrote in a note on Wednesday that Microsoft deserves a premium valuation relative to the market with its investment in OpenAI as a source of upside. We believe Microsofts investment in OpenAI will translate to significant underappreciated upside Luria wrote. He added that the unprecedented activity in ChatGPT is translating to incremental volumes for Azure. Luria said there are estimates of between 250 million and 1 billion annual run rate of expenses at OpenAI much of which is likely being spent on Azure. Even with the Azure credit bung OpenAI will need to start spending hard cash on Microsofts infrastructure eventually provided the tech giant negotiated exclusivity ChatGPT has already crossed 1 million users according to Altman. OpenAI itself expects 1 billion in revenue by 2024 according to Reuters. DA Davidson expects those levels to increase significantly with the introduction of OpenAIs GPT 4 its nextgeneration AI model later this year. Bing too has room to grow. Luria estimates with 120 billion of annual run rate revenue Google Search represents most of Googles 1. 1 trillion of value while Bing at around 11 billion of run rate revenue represents at most 5 of Microsofts revenue and value. Longerterm we believe incorporating ChatGPT capabilities into Bing may provide Microsoft with a onceadecade opportunity to unseat Googles Search dominance he wrote. Investors may be souring on speculative tech but AI looks resilient There is speculation that Microsoft may look to buy OpenAI. But an investment rather than a buyout gives it flexibility and room to experiment. Google by contrast bought Londonbased DeepMind in 2014 and has mostly seen its acquisition lose money since its expensive to own and operate what is effectively a private research faculty. DeepMind spends about half a billion dollars on staffing costs alone annually. And while investors may be generally souring on tech the field of artificial intelligence remains resilient. Figures from data firm Pitchbook suggest that VC investment in AI hit 1. 37 billion in 2022 across 78 deals representing almost the total invested over the past five years. Other sectors saw declines by contrast. That suggests investors will still look to pile into the hottest AI companies cementing the value of Microsofts deal. Nearterm challenges facing financial markets could result in improved deal terms for investors which could ultimately lead to heightened returns in the future Nalin Patel lead analyst of EMEA private capital at Pitchbook told Insider. Therefore investors will be keen to deploy capital into companies operating in nascent areas with strong longterm growth potential such as OpenAI. In a research note Pitchbook senior analyst Brendan Burke said that in 2023 AI startups will stand out by applying something known as imitation learning to AI foundation models a means of training general AI models to carry out specific tasks. Specifically the excitement in imitation learning he noted comes from the potential to produce commercial business models particularly if they are embedded within foundation models such as OpenAIs upcoming GPT4. OpenAI has made imitation learning a key area of interest having published a paper in June 2022 about a neural network trained to play Minecraft after watching 70000 hours of videos online. OpenAIs eventual growth and profitability is not a slam dunk. There have been several AI winters which saw interest in research and funding drop off. And slow progress in some areas like selfdriving cars has fueled skepticism when it comes to AI working in the wild. And Burke noted that AI features such as imitation learning remain unproven in a commercial context and may suffer from a lack of quality data on user task completion. Ethicists also fret about how blackbox AI could be abused. Still 2022 felt like a genieoutofthebottle moment thanks to ChatGPT and the popularity of OpenAIs generative image model DALLE.

Microsoft is starting the new year with a generous new policy for its U. S. employees. Starting January 16 Microsoft is implementing a Discretionary Time Off policy which gives employees unlimited time off without needing to accrue vacation days. Any employees who currently have unused PTO days will get a onetime payout in April. How when and where we do our jobs has dramatically changed Kathleen Hogan Microsofts chief people officer wrote in a memo obtained by The Verge. And as weve transformed modernizing our vacation policy to a more flexible model was a natural next step. Related I Was a Skeptic Now I am Convinced Unlimited PTO is Good Business The policy only applies to salaried employees in the U. S. and excludes overseas workers and hourly employees. Microsoft says its difficult to offer unlimited time off to hourly and foreign workers due to differing laws and regulations according to The Verge. The new policy comes as more companies have adopted flexible work schedules following the pandemic. When lockdowns rocked workplace norms irrevocably what followed was The Great Resignation where large numbers of workers left jobs in search of a more balanced lifestyle. As employees set new standards companies have revved up perks and benefits to attract and retain talent in a tight labor market where many individuals seek more than just a paycheck and unlimited time off is not a bad place to start.
