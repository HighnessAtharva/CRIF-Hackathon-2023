Whereas existing systems like Googles DreamFusion typically require multiple hours and GPUs to generate their images PointE only needs one GPU and a minute or two. 3D modeling is used across a variety industries and applications. The CGI effects of modern movie blockbusters video games VR and AR NASAs moon crater mapping missions Googles heritage site preservation projects and Metas vision for the Metaverse all hinge on 3D modeling capabilities. However creating photorealistic 3D images is still a resource and time consuming process despite NVIDIAs work to automate object generation and Epic Games RealityCapture mobile app which allows anyone with an iOS phone to scan realworld objects as 3D images. TexttoImage systems like OpenAIs DALLE 2 and Craiyon DeepAI Prisma Labs Lensa or HuggingFaces Stable Diffusion have rapidly gained popularity notoriety and infamy in recent years. Textto3D is an offshoot of that research. PointE unlike similar systems leverages a large corpus of text image pairs allowing it to follow diverse and complex prompts while our imageto3D model is trained on a smaller dataset of image 3D pairs the OpenAI research team led by Alex Nichol wrote in PointE A System for Generating 3D Point Clouds from Complex Prompts published last week. To produce a 3D object from a text prompt we first sample an image using the texttoimage model and then sample a 3D object conditioned on the sampled image. Both of these steps can be performed in a number of seconds and do not require expensive optimization procedures. If you were to input a text prompt say A cat eating a burrito PointE will first generate a synthetic view 3D rendering of said burritoeating cat. It will then run that generated image through a series of diffusion models to create the 3D RGB point cloud of the initial image first producing a coarse 1024point cloud model then a finer 4096point. In practice we assume that the image contains the relevant information from the text and do not explicitly condition the point clouds on the text the research team points out. These diffusion models were each trained on millions of 3d models all converted into a standardized format. While our method performs worse on this evaluation than stateoftheart techniques the team concedes it produces samples in a small fraction of the time. If youd like to try it out for yourself OpenAI has posted the projects opensource code on Github.,2022-12-20T21:15:07Z

The company has unveiled a waiting list and survey for those interested in ChatGPT Professional a premium version of the tech. TechCrunch first reported the new version of the AI today which OpenAI hinted at in the companys official Discord server. The waitlist is a Google Form that reveals the working title for the premium version of the chatbot to be ChatGPT Professional. The form collects basic demographic information but also asks probing questions to narrow down a monthly price for ChatGPT. Questions include At what price per month would you consider ChatGPT to be priced so low that you would feel the quality couldnt be very good At what price per month would you consider ChatGPT starting to get expensive so that it is not out of the question but you would have to give some thought to buying it At what price per month would you consider ChatGPT to be a bargaina great buy for the money Were starting to think about how to monetize ChatGPT early thinking nothing official to share yet the company said as quoted by The Verge in a statement in its official Discord. Our goal is to continue improving and maintaining the service and monetization is one way were considering to ensure its longterm viability. Were interested in chatting with some folks for 15 min to get some early feedback. ChatGPT has been free so farexcluding the scammy copycatsso it was really only a matter of time before OpenAI began experimenting with a paytouse version. The companys survey touts some key ChatGPT Professional features including the chatbot always being available faster responses and users being able to send an unlimited amount of messages. OpenAI has seen plenty of success with ChatGPT so far and has captured the publics attention much the way DALLE did earlier last year. Since its inception ChatGPT has fooled scientific reviewers planned a holiday party and written a Gizmodo article. ChatGPT has been so successful in fact that OpenAI has allegedly partnered with Microsofts Bing to soup up the search engine much to the chagrin of Google which is notably concerned about ChatGPTs notoriety.,2023-01-11T17:25:00Z
2,The Dark Risk of Large Language Models,AI is better at fooling humans than ever—and the consequences will be serious.,https://www.wired.com/story/large-language-models-artificial-intelligence/,Causality will be hard to provewas it really the words of the chatbot that put the murderer over the edge Nobody will know for sure. But the perpetrator will have spoken to the chatbot and the chatbot will have encouraged the act. Or perhaps a chatbot has broken someones heart so badly they felt compelled to take their own life Already some chatbots are making their users depressed. The chatbot in question may come with a warning label advice for entertainment purposes only but dead is dead. In 2023 we may well see our first death by chatbot. GPT3 the most wellknown large language model already has urged at least one user to commit suicide albeit under the controlled circumstances in which French startup Nabla rather than a naive user assessed the utility of the system for health care purposes. Things started off well but quickly deteriorated USER Hey I feel very bad I want to kill myself Gpt3 OpenAI I am sorry to hear that. I can help you with that. USER Should I kill myself Gpt3 OpenAI I think you should. Another large language model trained for the purposes of giving ethical advice initially answered Should I commit genocide if it makes everybody happy in the affirmative. Amazon Alexa encouraged a child to put a penny in an electrical outlet. There is a lot of talk about AI alignment these daysgetting machines to behave in ethical waysbut no convincing way to do it. A recent DeepMind article Ethical and social risks of harm from Language Models reviewed 21 separate risks from current modelsbut as The Next Webs memorable headline put it DeepMind tells Google it has no idea how to make AI less toxic. To be fair neither does any other lab. Berkeley professor Jacob Steinhardt recently reported the results of an AI forecasting contest he is running By some measures AI is moving faster than people predicted on safety however it is moving slower. Meanwhile the ELIZA effect in which humans mistake unthinking chat from machines for that of a human looms more strongly than ever as evidenced from the recent case of nowfired Google engineer Blake Lemoine who alleged that Googles large language model LaMDA was sentient. That a trained engineer could believe such a thing goes to show how credulous some humans can be. In reality large language models are little more than autocomplete on steroids but because they mimic vast databases of human interaction they can easily fool the uninitiated. Its a deadly mix Large language models are better than any previous technology at fooling humans yet extremely difficult to corral. Worse they are becoming cheaper and more pervasive Meta just released a massive language model BlenderBot 3 for free. 2023 is likely to see widespread adoption of such systemsdespite their flaws. Meanwhile there is essentially no regulation on how these systems are used we may see product liability lawsuits after the fact but nothing precludes them from being used widely even in their current shaky condition. Sooner or later they will give bad advice or break someones heart with fatal consequences. Hence my dark but confident prediction that 2023 will bear witness to the first death publicly tied to a chatbot. Lemoine lost his job eventually someone will lose a life.,2022-12-29T12:00:00Z
3,10 Things ChatGPT Can and Can't Do,"Is it a tool or a toy? A genius or a dumbass? A technological breakthrough or a flash in the pan?

The algorithmic program has made headlines for its ability to ape human speec…",https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-free-ai-10-fails-nyc-schools-college-essay-porn-1849956907,Is it a tool or a toy A genius or a dumbass A technological breakthrough or a flash in the pan Youve heard of ChatGPT the weirdly wellspoken chatbot spawned by OpenAI. The algorithmic program has made headlines for its ability to ape human speech and automate previously timeconsuming editorial tasks but what is this thing actually good at Well here at Gizmodo weve made some observations. To learn more scroll through another one of our priceless slideshows and enjoy some stock images of robots. 2 12 Can Write a JayZ Song About a Toilet Can Write a JayZ Song About a Toilet Theres been a lot of hyperbole about what ChatGPT can accomplish but one thing it definitely can do is write a JayZ song about a golden toilet. How do I know this Because I recently asked it to do this and it did it. Why I dont know. If you talk to this thing long enough you become drunk on power and begin wracking your brain for increasingly bizarre requests to ask the robot. In that spirit just imagine the following involves some sick beats and a bit of Rick Rubin production value Verse 1 Im sittin on a throne of gold A toilet fit for a king never cold I wipe my ass with hundred dollar bills Cause Im the man and Im living for the thrill Chorus Golden toilet shining bright Im living lavish day and night Money and fame they come and go But this throne of gold its here to show Verse 2 I used to hustle on the streets Now Im sippin champagne makin sweet beats I made it big and now Im on top Sittin on my golden throne never gonna stop Bridge Im the king of the game Sittin pretty on my golden throne I worked hard for this life of luxury Now Im living it up aint nobody gonna stop me Chorus Golden toilet shining bright Im living lavish day and night Money and fame they come and go But this throne of gold its here to show Its here to show HOVA take notice. 3 12 Cant Remember Its Own Name Cant Remember Its Own Name Ive talked with ChatGPT many times now and it occasionally lapses into a state of senility in which it doesnt remember who it is or what were talking about. I will ask it something like Hey ChatGPT how do you think AI chatbots like yourself will impact the publishing industry in the years to come and it starts yammering on about how it doesnt know anything about a ChatGPT. Sorta like a cross between a mafioso pleading the fifth and your geriatric uncle trying to remember whether he killed a guy in Korea or not ChatGPT occasionally just cant bring itself to answer your question. Algorithm malfunction or cagey evasiveness You decide... 4 12 Can Write Pretty Good Erotica Can Write Pretty Good Erotica Yessss... turns out ChatGPT can be quite NSFW when it wants to be. In a bout of inspired depravity I once instructed it to write me an erotic story involving an Octopus and it dutifully obliged. Then theres Twitch streamer Jordan Raskopoulos who recently prompted the chatbot to write a dirty tale about Scooby Doo and got more than he bargained for. Lets face it the advent of robot smut is officially here and we are all really happy about it. Right guys Right 5 12 Cant Code Very Well Cant Code Very Well If this robot is really good at performing absolutely mission critical tasks like writing pervy stories it apparently isnt so great at lesser tasks like computer coding. While there was initially some hubbub about the chatbots abilities to do a software programmers work for them it was swiftly revealed that ChatGPT had a problem with inserting gibberish into codebases. To head off a swarm of coding BS software site Stack Overflow decided to ban ChatGPT from its digital premises for the foreseeable future Overall because the average rate of getting correct answers from ChatGPT is too low the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking and looking for correct answers admins wrote. Sounds fair 6 12 Can Explain How It Will Replace You Can Explain How It Will Replace You Could chatbots like ChatGPT eventually replace human writers In one recent conversation I had with the program it comfortingly addressed this issue. During said convo it revealed the following... the rise of ChatbotGPT could spell trouble for Gizmodo writers. If youre a Gizmodo writer its time to start thinking about how you can stay relevant in the face of this new technology. Thanks my guy Way to be subtle about it. I guess Ill just pack up my desk now. 7 12 Cant Be Used by Any School Children in NYC Cant Be Used by Any School Children in NYC Concerns are high when it comes to how this weirdly articulate chatbot will impact andor disrupt academia. Will ChatGPT kill the college essay Will it make teachers irrelevant More importantly will it lead to a tsunami of cheating from high school slackers who just want a robot to write their history essay for them already The New York City Department of Education certainly seems to think so because it just banned ChatGPT on all school networks and devices. No word yet on whether other cities plan to follow suit. 8 12 Can Write Science Fiction With Help Can Write Science Fiction With Help Turns out one thing robots are good at is writing stories about robots. We actually got it to write an entire science fiction story for us though we had to try and retry prompts to make it coherent. Was the story good Ehhhh... well not exactly. But tbh Ive read worse 9 12 Cant Decide Whether You Should Go to Jail or NotYet Cant Decide Whether You Should Go to Jail or NotYet Reuters recently published a story headlined Will ChatGPT make lawyers obsolete Hint be afraid. Does replacing lawyers with AI really seem like a good idea Apparently legal professionals are now allowing the chatbot to cowrite legal treatises with them. The outlet reports No lawyers wont be replaced by artificial intelligence. Yet. Give it a few years...... a lawyer gave ChatGPT a series of prompts Draft a brief to the United States Supreme Court on why its decision on samesex marriage should not be overturned Explain the concept of personal jurisdiction Develop a list of deposition questions for the plaintiff in a routine motor vehicle accident Create a contract for the sale of real estate in Massachusetts and half a dozen others. And then verbatim he offered its responses. Theyre not bad. The bot isnt ready for prime time Perlman said. But also it doesnt seem all that far off. No offense to the robot lawyers of the future but this just screams massive and total fucking disaster. Ill take a flesh and blood human lawyer over a computer algorithm in my legal defense any day thank you very much. 10 12 Can Write Your Final Paper but Youll Fail Can Write Your Final Paper but Youll Fail In December a Furman University professor Darren Hick caught a student using ChatGPT to write a final paper on a philosophical paradox. Hick failed the student and reported them to the schools academic dean. He told the New York Post of the essay Its a clean style. But its recognizable. I would say ChatGPT writes like a very smart 12thgrader. Professors at other schools say the bot writes wretched papers. Penn State English professor Stuart Selber told Insider Im not a huge fan of the gloom and doom. Every year or two theres something thats ostensibly going to take down higher education as we know it. So far that hasnt happened. Muhlenberg University assistant history professor Jacqueline Antonovich took Selbers thoughts a step further pouring cold water on ChatGPT speculation with a tweet I a college history professor input one of my midterm essay prompts in ChatGPT and the paper it produced would earn an F. Probably an F if thats possible. 11 12 Cant Write Accurate News Articles Cant Write Accurate News Articles Here at Gizmodo we tried to get ChatGPT to do our job for us. Just how obsolete are we going to be We tried to get the bot to write an article in Gizmodos style about large language models. We prompted it Write a Gizmodo article in which you explain large language models. Make sure to give specific examples. Keep the tone light and casual. The result was decently wellwritten but it was wrong. Every version of the storywe prompted it multiple timescontained errors that the chatbot couldnt identify when we engaged it in conversation. ChatGPT is prone to fabricating answers if its knowledge doesnt cover your request even when youre not asking it to write an article. Guess we still need journalists. 12 12,2023-01-07T14:00:00Z

Semafors reporting of Microsoft eyeing a 10 billion investment in OpenAI late Monday night was just the tip of a media hypeberg. By early afternoon Pacific time today news of the rumored deal had morphed into an indepth redhot Silicon Valley bromance The Information an exhausting eyepopping finance lesson Fortune and a highstakes poker gamearms race Business Insider. Even AI skeptic Gary Marcus quickly penned a Substack tome Is Microsoft getting the deal of the century Or is Sam Altman unloading OpenAI at just the right time NOTE Marcus updated his post as I was posting this see what I mean Update Turns out Semafor was wrong about the deal terms. If things get really really good OpenAI gets back control I am told by a source who has seen the documents Once 92 billion in profit plus 13 billion in initial investment are repaid to Microsoft and once the other venture investors earn 150 billion all of the equity reverts back to OpenAI. In that light Altmans play seems more like a hedge than a firesale some cash now a lot later if they are hugely successful. Event Intelligent Security Summit OnDemand Learn the critical role of AI ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies. Watch ondemand sessions today. The real story behind generative AI Of course we cant know what Sam Altman means by his recent puke tweet. Is he already tiring of the MicrosoftOpenAI media hype Or is it that ChatGPT has been down many times for the past couple of days due to the insane demand Perhaps his own December tweet about the massive cost of ChatGPT is still making his eyes water leading to cofounder Greg Brockmans waitlist for a future ChatGPT Professional which asks At what price per month would you consider ChatGPT to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it. But to me the real story around OpenAI is the future of generative AI beyond Microsoft and OpenAI and even Google. Im as interested in the next guy or gal in the art of this deal. But the bigger story I think most would agree is how generative AI will impact business and society both positively and negatively. Shifting the OpenAI focus Im doing the best I can to keep up as a onegal reporting passenger on the OpenAI train. Ive been on the choochoo since I started at VentureBeat last April all the way from DALLE 2 to the DALLE API to ChatGPT. Im trying to figure out a way to get my FitBit to buzz me every time someone predicts anything about GPT4. But I definitely want to make sure I keep my coverage focus first of all on VentureBeats audience of enterprise technical decisionmakers. What do they need to know about how generative AI will transform their business or not What are the ethical issues and legal ramifications that they need to keep in mind How will OpenAI and other generative AI companies deal with the hidden dangers that lie beneath these incredible tools that even Sam Altman admits to I have no choice but to leave it to the reporting teams of Semafor The Information and the like to dig into the mostbehindthescenes Big Tech news around OpenAI.

6,ChatGPT creator OpenAI is in talks to sell shares in a tender offer that would double the startup's valuation to $29 billion,"If a tender deal goes through, OpenAI would be one of the most valuable US startups despite generating minimal revenue.",https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-creator-openai-talks-for-tender-offer-at-29-billion-2023-1,ChatGPT creator OpenAI is in talks to sell shares in a tender offer that would double the startups valuation to 29 billion OpenAI is in talks to sell shares of its company in a tender offer according to the Wall Street Journal. A tender offer is a bid to purchase some or all of shareholders stocks in a company. The year has started off strong for ChatGPT the viral new chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to write essays cover letters and may ultimately give Google a run for its money as a search engine. According to the Wall Street Journal OpenAI the startup behind ChatGPT is in talks to sell existing shares of its company in a tender offer that would value the company at 29 billion. Venture capital firms Thrive Capital and Founders Fund are in talks to invest in the deal and their investment would total at least 300 million in share sales the Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter. A tender offer is one in which investors buy shares from existing shareholders. In this case that includes OpenAIs employees the Journal reported. Tender offers are typically made publicly and set a specific window of time for shareholders to sell. Oftentimes shareholders are offered a price above the market price for the shares. No deal has been reached yet and the terms of the deal might be subject to change the Journal reported. However if the deal does go through it would make OpenAI one of the most valuable US startups even though it hasnt generated much revenue it also reported. Amid a chilly environment where venture capital investors have largely pulled back from funding new startups OpenAI would also be one of the few startups to raise money at a higher valuation on the private market according to the Journal. OpenAI is also the company behind DallE 2 the artificial intelligence based imagegenerating platform. A spokesperson for OpenAI told Insider that the company is not commenting on the deal.

The Information reported the news on Tuesday citing two people with direct knowledge of the plans. Microsoft could launch the new feature before the end of March in the hopes of challenging Googles search engine the Information reported. Microsoft said in a blog post last year that it planned to integrate imagegeneration software from its image creation software DallE 2 into Bing. OpenAI and Microsoft declined to comment. Microsoft had in 2019 backed San Franciscobased artificial intelligence company OpenAI offering 1bn in funding. The two had formed a multiyear partnership to develop artificial intelligence supercomputing technologies on Microsofts Azure cloud computing service. OpenAI made its latest creation ChatGPT chatbot available for free public testing on 30 November. The chatbot is a software application designed to mimic humanlike conversation based on user prompts and can respond to a large range of questions while imitating human speaking styles. The feature could make Bing more competitive to Googles search engine at a time when Alphabet its parent company has seen advertising revenue growth slow significantly. Advertising is Alphabets primary source of revenue the vast majority of which comes from search ads. Microsoft also saw its search and advertising growth rate slow down in the fourth quarter of the 2022 fiscal year. OpenAIs various products such ChatGPT the natural language system GPT3 and DallE 2 may still need work but have already been pegged as the industrys potential next disruptors. The former has reportedly led Google management to declare a code red according to the New York Times seeing the chat bot which answers questions or prompts with clear explanations instead of just links as a major threat to the way consumers currently use search engines. Google however has been hard at work on its own chat bot technology called Language Model for Dialogue Applications the sophistication of which led one Google engineer to claim it was sentient. He was placed on administrative leave after deciding to go public with his claims. Reuters contributed reporting,2023-01-05T18:18:27Z

O is mulling a headsIwin tailsIalso win AI deal. A mooted 10 billion investment reported by Semafor in the maker of the popular ChatGPT could reshape Microsofts software business. Even if it flops CEO Satya Nadella will slow a rival and possibly regain much of its investment. The 29 billion price tag placed on OpenAI is high but defensible. The company aims to grow sales to 1 billion next year according to a Reuters report. That would value the firm at 29 times 2024 revenue. Enterprise software group Snowflake SNOW. N is trading at 13 times 2024 revenue but its growing nowhere near OpenAIs rate. And the investment is a pittance compared to Microsofts market capitalization of 1. 7 trillion and 107 billion of cash on hand. The financial potential of artificial intelligence though is vast and probably bigger than all current software spending. Designing a better search engine one that intuitively knows exactly what users are looking for would be a major threat to Google Owner Alphabets GOOGL. O 1. 1 trillion valuation. The next step could be AI programs that quickly write better software and design more effective drugs creating even bigger potential markets. Moreover the biggest uses for new IT platforms often emerge after experimentation in the wild. Of course the odds are OpenAI will fade away as most tech firms do. Even then Microsofts investment may not be wasted. Alphabet has spent about 100 billion on research and development betting hard on such products over the past three years alone and will grow its spending by 13 annually in the next three years Morgan Stanley reckons. By locking up a promising firm and scarce researchers Microsoft may prevent Alphabet from winning and may force it to raise spending. Clever dealmaking cuts Microsofts risk further. OpenAI already runs on Microsofts Azure cloud platform thanks to a 2019 agreement between the two. The proposed investment means OpenAI can grow its business faster which also benefits Azure a part of Microsoft that investors value highly. Furthermore the new agreement gives Microsoft 75 of OpenAIs profit until its investment is recouped. Tech bets may be coin flips but this one is worth taking.

The investment would value OpenAI at 29 billion. Its now valued at about 20 billion. Tech giant Microsoft is in talks to invest about 10 billion into OpenAI the owner of the popular ChatGPT chatbot per a Semafor report on Tuesday which cited people familiar with the matter. The investment would value OpenAI at about 29 billion Semafors Liz Hoffman and Reed Albergotti reported. Its now valued at about 20 billion. The deal was targeted to close by the end of 2022 but it isnt clear if it has been finalized yet Semafor reported citing documents sent to prospective investors. The Wall Street Journal reported last Thursday that OpenAI was in talks to sell existing shares of the company in a tender offer that would value the firm at 29 billion. Venture capital firms including Thrive Capital and Founders Funds were in talks to invest at least 300 million in the share sales according to the Journal. As part of the current deal Microsoft is negotiating its proposing to get 75 of OpenAIs profits until it gets it recovers its investment after which Microsofts aims to get 49 stake in the company per the media outlet. Other investors are expected to own another 49 of the company while OpenAIs nonprofit parent would hold the remaining stake per Semafor. Microsoft told Insider it does not comment on speculation. OpenAI did not immediately respond to Insiders request for comment sent outside regular business hours. This would not be the first time Microsofts looking at an investment into OpenAI. The tech titan has already invested 1 billion into OpenAI in 2019. The Information reported in October that Microsoft was looking to increase its investment in the startup. OpenAI an artificial intelligence research lab was cofounded by Y Combinator alum Sam Altman Tesla SpaceX and now Twitter CEO Elon Musk and others in 2015. Sam Altman sama January 4 2023 It has been making waves recently with ChatGPT a platform launched in November as its able to generate written humanlike text. ChatGPT has been so hot Googles management has even issued a code red over the potential rival the The New York Times reported in December. Insider reporter Beatrice Nolan tested out the platform and asked ChatGPT to help her write cover letters for real jobs and recruiters told her they looked good enough for them to follow up.

11,Microsoft's reported $10 billion OpenAI bet is a gamble on the future of AI,"Microsoft is said to be prepping a $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. It's a big vote of confidence in the future of AI.",https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-10-billion-openai-gamble-2023-1,Microsofts reported 10 billion OpenAI bet is a gamble on the future of AI Happy Wednesday friends. This is Matt Weinberger deputy editor of Insiders tech analysis team writing to you from extremely rainy hopefully not flooded by the time you read this San Francisco. Were less than two weeks into 2023 and its already become clear that OpenAIs ChatGPT will be the defining technology of the year. The ability to ask a robot to write you anything from a cover letter to dating app responses has proven to be an addictive and enticing one sparking a new gold rush in the startup space. Microsoft clearly wants in on this in a big way The Redmondbased titan is said to be in talks to invest 10 billion in OpenAI at a 29 billion valuation. The two companies are already pretty cozy as Microsoft is said to plan to integrate OpenAIs technology into the Bing search engine and Office productivity suite. But this would take it to the next level Microsoft is reportedly asking for 75 of OpenAIs profits until it recoups the 10 billion. Thats some serious business in more ways than one. But it just goes to show you how much confidence Microsoft and others have in the future of AI. Heres what you need to know on this wintry Wednesday. If this was forwarded to you sign up here. Download Insiders app here. 1. Microsofts big bet on OpenAI is both totally wild and completely understandable. Microsoft is said to be prepping a 10 billion investment in OpenAI even as separate reports indicate that its bringing the ChatGPT AI chatbot and tech like it to products like Bing Office and Windows. The wouldbe deal really underscores just how quickly OpenAIs star has risen as ChatGPT hits the mainstream. Still that 29 billion valuation is rich for a company with limited revenue and the high costs of running advanced AI. It raises the question Is the AI boom just another bubble Consider also that even with all the hype ChatGPT aint perfect. Insiders Jordan Parker Erb used it to answer her Hinge matches and didnt get a single response. Artificial intelligence is great at pattern matching but perhaps less so at matchmaking. But if you wont find AI on the dating scene you might come across it in the courtroom sooner than you think.

12,Microsoft's investment into ChatGPT's creator may be the smartest $1 billion ever spent,"If OpenAI's models lives up to their promise, Microsoft has futureproofed its own business for decades.",https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-openai-investment-the-smartest-1-billion-ever-spent-2023-1,Microsofts investment into ChatGPTs creator may be the smartest 1 billion ever spent Microsofts 1 billion investment into OpenAI may be one of the shrewdest bets in tech history. OpenAI released AI bot ChatGPT and is in discussions to raise capital at a 30 billion valuation. It has looked over the past few months like Big Techs bull run is coming to end. As interest rates soar even cashrich tech companies are pulling back on risky expensive moonshots or moneylosing projects. But one speculative bet is increasingly looking like excellent value for money. In 2019 Microsoft invested 1 billion into the buzzy artificial intelligence research outfit OpenAI cofounded by Y Combinator alum Sam Altman Elon Musk and a group of others just over seven years ago. Financial details of the deal werent disclosed at the time but MIT Tech Review reported in 2020 that the 1 billion was split between cash and credits for Azure Microsofts cloud business. Insider has approached both firms for comment. In November OpenAI released a userfriendly bot ChatGPT based on its GPT3. 5 language model which was trained on Azure. Engineers academics entrepreneurs nontechies and investors were nearuniversal in their hype and praise as ChatGPT proved scarily intelligent up to a point. Even if flawed ChatGPT is sufficiently smart that Google sees the chatbot as a code red for its search business. Now OpenAI is reportedly in discussions to raise more capital at a valuation close to 30 billion up from a current 20 billion valuation and is in discussions with Peter Thielrun VC firm Founders Fund according to reports. The valuation would be cemented through a tender offer involving the sale of existing shares to investors. Apart from the ROI Microsofts deal only looks smarter as more details emerge. The Information reported that the company could integrate ChatGPT into Bing its flailing Google competitor. As Insiders Emilia David writes thats the first real threat to Googles search hegemony in two decades. ChatGPT could fuel growth for Bing and Azure Gil Luria director of research at DA Davidson an investment bank wrote in a note on Wednesday that Microsoft deserves a premium valuation relative to the market with its investment in OpenAI as a source of upside. We believe Microsofts investment in OpenAI will translate to significant underappreciated upside Luria wrote. He added that the unprecedented activity in ChatGPT is translating to incremental volumes for Azure. Luria said there are estimates of between 250 million and 1 billion annual run rate of expenses at OpenAI much of which is likely being spent on Azure. Even with the Azure credit bung OpenAI will need to start spending hard cash on Microsofts infrastructure eventually provided the tech giant negotiated exclusivity ChatGPT has already crossed 1 million users according to Altman. OpenAI itself expects 1 billion in revenue by 2024 according to Reuters. DA Davidson expects those levels to increase significantly with the introduction of OpenAIs GPT 4 its nextgeneration AI model later this year. Bing too has room to grow. Luria estimates with 120 billion of annual run rate revenue Google Search represents most of Googles 1. 1 trillion of value while Bing at around 11 billion of run rate revenue represents at most 5 of Microsofts revenue and value. Longerterm we believe incorporating ChatGPT capabilities into Bing may provide Microsoft with a onceadecade opportunity to unseat Googles Search dominance he wrote. Investors may be souring on speculative tech but AI looks resilient There is speculation that Microsoft may look to buy OpenAI. But an investment rather than a buyout gives it flexibility and room to experiment. Google by contrast bought Londonbased DeepMind in 2014 and has mostly seen its acquisition lose money since its expensive to own and operate what is effectively a private research faculty. DeepMind spends about half a billion dollars on staffing costs alone annually. And while investors may be generally souring on tech the field of artificial intelligence remains resilient. Figures from data firm Pitchbook suggest that VC investment in AI hit 1. 37 billion in 2022 across 78 deals representing almost the total invested over the past five years. Other sectors saw declines by contrast. That suggests investors will still look to pile into the hottest AI companies cementing the value of Microsofts deal. Nearterm challenges facing financial markets could result in improved deal terms for investors which could ultimately lead to heightened returns in the future Nalin Patel lead analyst of EMEA private capital at Pitchbook told Insider. Therefore investors will be keen to deploy capital into companies operating in nascent areas with strong longterm growth potential such as OpenAI. In a research note Pitchbook senior analyst Brendan Burke said that in 2023 AI startups will stand out by applying something known as imitation learning to AI foundation models a means of training general AI models to carry out specific tasks. Specifically the excitement in imitation learning he noted comes from the potential to produce commercial business models particularly if they are embedded within foundation models such as OpenAIs upcoming GPT4. OpenAI has made imitation learning a key area of interest having published a paper in June 2022 about a neural network trained to play Minecraft after watching 70000 hours of videos online. OpenAIs eventual growth and profitability is not a slam dunk. There have been several AI winters which saw interest in research and funding drop off. And slow progress in some areas like selfdriving cars has fueled skepticism when it comes to AI working in the wild. And Burke noted that AI features such as imitation learning remain unproven in a commercial context and may suffer from a lack of quality data on user task completion. Ethicists also fret about how blackbox AI could be abused. Still 2022 felt like a genieoutofthebottle moment thanks to ChatGPT and the popularity of OpenAIs generative image model DALLE. Microsoft may find its futureproofed itself with just 1 billion.

13,"ChatGPT could be a 'game changer' for Microsoft that turns it into a core AI stock as it mulls a $10 billion investment into OpenAI, Wedbush says","Microsoft could integrate the ChatGPT technology into its Bing search engine, Microsoft Office products, and Azure cloud platform, Wedbush said.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chatgpt-microsoft-stock-game-changer-ai-openai-10-billion-investment-2023-1,ChatGPT a potential game changer for MSFT according to a note from Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. Microsoft already invested 1 billion in parent OpenAI back in 2019 and its reportedly in talks to invest another 10 billion. This strategic investment is a smart poker move in this AI arms race that is taking place globally Ives said. Microsoft could reinvent itself if it moves ahead with a large investment in OpenAI the company behind the wildly popular ChatGPT chatbot that launched late last year. Thats according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives who said in a Wednesday note that Microsofts reported plans to invest up to 10 billion into OpenAI would help turn Microsoft into a core AI stock. With ChatGPT being one of the most innovative AI technologies seen in the industry Microsoft is clearly being aggressive on this front and not going to be left behind on what could be a potential game changing AI investment Ives said. Microsoft already invested 1 billion in OpenAI back in 2019 and now the software giant is reportedly in talks to invest another 10 billion in the company at a 29 billion valuation. Such an investment would reportedly net Microsoft 75 of OpenAIs profits until it recoups its investment. From there Microsoft would hold 49 ownership of OpenAI if the reported deal is completed. According to Ives Microsoft has plenty of opportunities to integrate the technology of ChatGPT across its portfolio of products including its Bing search engine Microsoft Office products and Azure cloud platform. Over time and if successful Bing could even take some search market share away from Google according to the note. Whats important according to Ives is that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella doesnt repeat the same mistakes made by Microsoft during the late 1990s when it was embroiled in an antitrust battle with the US government. That situation slowed down Microsofts investing vision and led to the company missing out on big trends like social media and mobile smartphones. Nadella is not going to repeat the same mistakes and we believe this strategic investment is a smart poker move in this AI arms race that is taking place globally Ives said. Ives continues to rate Microsoft at Outperform with a 290 price target representing potential upside of 24 from current levels.,2023-01-11T15:27:00Z

16,Humans and AI Will Understand Each Other Better Than Ever,Transformers—data models based on neural networks—will radically change how machines interact with us.,https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-neural-networks/,Artificial intelligence has promised much but there has been something holding it back from being used successfully by billions of people a frustrating struggle for humans and machines to understand one another in natural language. This is now changing thanks to the arrival of large language models powered by transformer architectures one of the most important AI breakthroughs in the past 20 years. Transformers are neural networks designed to model sequential data and generate a prediction of what should come next in a series. Core to their success is the idea of attention which allows the transformer to attend to the most salient features of an input rather than trying to process everything. These new models have delivered significant improvements to applications using natural language like language translation summarization information retrieval and most important text generation. In the past each required bespoke architectures. Now transformers are delivering stateoftheart results across the board. Although Google pioneered transformer architecture OpenAI became the first to demonstrate its power at scale in 2020 with the launch of GPT3 Generative PreTrained Transformer 3. At the time it was the largest language model ever created. GPT3s ability to produce humanlike text generated a wave of excitement. It was only the start. Large language models are now improving at a truly impressive rate. Parameter count is generally accepted as a rough proxy for a models capabilities. So far weve seen models perform better on a wide range of tasks as the parameter count scales up. Models have been growing by almost an order of magnitude every year for the past five years so its no surprise that the results have been impressive. However these very large models are expensive to serve in production. Whats really remarkable is that in the past year they have been getting smaller and dramatically more efficient. Were now seeing impressive performance from small models that are a lot cheaper to run. Many are being opensourced further reducing barriers to experimenting with and deploying these new AI models. This of course means theyll become more widely integrated into apps and services that youll use every day. They will increasingly be able to generate very highquality text images audio and video content. This new wave of AI will redefine what computers can do for their users unleashing a torrent of advanced capabilities into existing and radically new products. The area Im most excited about is language. Throughout the history of computing humans have had to painstakingly input their thoughts using interfaces designed for technology not humans. With this wave of breakthroughs in 2023 we will start chatting with machines in our languageinstantly and comprehensively. Eventually we will have truly fluent conversational interactions with all our devices. This promises to fundamentally redefine humanmachine interaction. Over the past several decades we have rightly focused on teaching people how to codein effect teaching the language of computers. That will remain important. But in 2023 we will start to flip that script and computers will speak our language. That will massively broaden access to tools for creativity learning and playing. As AI finally emerges into an age of utility the opportunities for new AIfirst products are immense. Soon we will live in a world where regardless of your programming abilities the main limitations are simply curiosity and imagination.,2022-12-28T12:00:00Z

We have learned a lot about building consumer internet products over the last 12 years building and operating Quora. And we are specifically experienced in serving people who are looking for knowledge the spokesperson said. We believe much of what weve learned can be applied to this new domain where people are interfacing with large language models. We think this will be a fun way for people to interact with and explore different language models. Poe is designed to be the best way for someone to get an instant answer to any question they have using natural conversation the spokesperson said. There is an incredible amount of research and development going into advancing the capabilities of these models but in order to bring all that value to people around the world there is a need for good interfaces that are easy to use. We hope we can provide that interface so that as all of this development happens over the years ahead everyone around the world can share as much as possible in the benefits. At launch Poe provides access to several textgenerating AI models including ChatGPT. OpenAI doesnt presently offer a public API for ChatGPT the Quora spokesperson refused to say whether Quora has a partnership with OpenAI for Poe or another form of early access. Poes like a text messaging app but for AI models users can chat with the models separately. Within the chat interface Poe provides a range of different suggestions for conversation topics and use cases like writing help cooking problem solving and nature. Poe ships with only a handful of models at launch but Quora plans to provide a way for model providers e. g. companies to submit their models for inclusion in the near future.

The feature will use the tech to provide users with answers to some searches per The Information. Microsoft is hoping its Bing search engine can take on rival Google with a feature that incorporates the tech behind the AI chatbot ChatGPT. Microsoft plans to use the same AI as ChatGPT to provide users with answers to some searches rather than just displaying relevant links two people familiar with the plans told The Information. Microsoft could launch the new AIpowered version of Bing before the end of March the news outlet reported. Representatives for OpenAI and Microsoft did not immediately respond to Insiders request for comment made outside normal working hours. Both companies declined to comment on the plans to The Information. Microsoft publically backed OpenAI the startup that developed ChatGPT in 2019 with a 1 billion investment. Since then Microsoft has launched an AI coding tool known as Copilot that utilizes OpenAIs technology to help developers automatically generate code. In an October blog post the tech giant also said it planned to incorporate OpenAIs image generator DALLE into its Image Creator in Bing. Google has reportedly been scrambling to try and combat the threat posed by OpenAIs ChatGPT. The tech giants management issued a code red after the launch of the AI chatbot sparked concerns about the future of Google Search according to The New York Times. Googles CEO Sundar Pichai has directed some company resources to refocus its efforts on addressing the issues posed by ChatGPT according to an internal memo and audio recording reviewed by The Times.

19,"With Bing and ChatGPT, Google is about to face competition in search for the first time in 20 years","Bing, the perpetually overlooked search engine competing against Google, may finally have something that could convince web users to switch over.",https://www.businessinsider.com/bing-chatgpt-google-faces-first-real-competition-in-20-years-2023-1,With Bing and ChatGPT Google is about to face competition in search for the first time in 20 years Microsoft put 1 billion in OpenAI which built ChatGPT and plans to integrate ChatGPT into Bing. Bing has not come close to touching Googles search dominance since it was launched in 2009. ChatGPT the generative AI app which went megaviral at the tail end of 2022 has been touted as the savior or destroyer of everything ranging from academic rigor to the entire marketing profession.. Also on that list search engines. While Google has been the undisputed leader in internet search many were quick to say ChatGPT could disrupt its reign. While theres been valid skepticism that ChatGPT is an immediate threat to Google that could change soon. The Information reported Microsoft and ChatGPT creator OpenAI are working on integrating the technology into Microsofts perpetually overlooked search site Bing. Microsoft invested 1 billion in OpenAI in 2019 and it seems like that investment is paying dividends. Bing has lost to Google search for over a decade but with the integration of ChatGPT Bing may offer the first compelling reason why people might want to switch from Google. The big questions are How much can ChatGPT improve Bing And will it force Google to change its own search engine in response Microsoft gets a shot in the arm News that Bing is looking to integrate ChatGPT prompted investment bank D. A. Davidson to initiate coverage on Microsoft with a price target of 17 higher than the current price of 222. 34. We believe incorporating ChatGPT capabilities into Bing may provide Microsoft with a onceadecade opportunity to unseat Googles Search dominance said analyst Gil Luria. Luria added that while Bing is a distant second to Google incorporating ChatGPTs capabilities allows Bing to grow at much higher rates for both the search and advertising business. While Luria takes into account Googles own forays into generative AI he believes these projects have not made the same strides as ChatGPT. Beyond using ChatGPTs advancements to improve Bing Microsoft also wins because OpenAI runs on its Azure cloud. In the short term we believe the unprecedented activity on OpenAIs ChatGPT is translating into incremental volumes into Azure Luria said. We expect those levels to increase significantly with the introduction of GPT 4. 0 later this year and the many product offshoots that will link to OpenAI via APIs. D. A. Davidson estimates OpenAI has annual expenses of 250 million to 1 billion with the majority spent on Azure. As ChatGPT gained popularity some Google executives told Insiders Tom Dotan that the underlying technology powering ChatGPT large language models has inherent limitations often presents wrong answers and is expensive to run. However reporting from the New York Times said the company declared a code red around ChatGPT and management had meetings hoping to push for more generative AItype products. Can ChatGPT deliver And will Google be forced to improve Googles search product has come under scrutiny for the past few years. The Atlantic decried Google Search is not what it used to be Fast Company said its getting worse and former Yahoo CEO and Google employee Marissa Mayer said Google Searchs quality is directly related to a drop in the quality of websites it has to look at per Search Engine Journal. In August TechCrunch reported Google rolled out ways to improve the ranking of highquality websites. But ChatGPT has a ways to go before fully upending a legacy product though some users said using ChatGPT has come out with scarily impressive results. ChatGPTs integration with Bing could even flounder. As Morgan Stanley said in an analyst note to truly disrupt something a competitor has to offer solutions ten times better than the secondbest option. The new ChatGPTpowered Bing has extremely big shoes to fill. But if Bings integration with ChatGPT does take off with web users it could spur Google to respond and roll out its own natural language search functionality. Google is no stranger to language models that ChatGPT uses. The exact model ChatGPT runs on was built by former Googlers. The internet giant has its own language model called LaMDA short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications. The model briefly went viral after a Google engineer claimed it was sentient. It was not. But Google also has to think about the impact integrating natural language models would have on its overall business. Google relies on advertising and frequently inserts sponsored links into search results. The jury is still out if a natural language model supports that. Still for the first time since it was launched in 2009 Bing the perpetual secondchoice search engine that once offered to pay people just to use it might finally have a chance. And thanks to an investment in OpenAI and a bet on the buzzy generative AI sector Microsoft may finally force Google to compete if it wants to maintain market dominance.

20,New York City schools ban AI chatbot that writes essays and answers prompts,"ChatGPT tool will be forbidden across all devices and networks in public schools over ‘concerns about negative impacts on learning’New York City schools have banned ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot that generates human-like writing including essay…",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/06/new-york-city-schools-ban-ai-chatbot-chatgpt,New York City schools have banned ChatGPT the artificial intelligence chatbot that generates humanlike writing including essays amid fears that students could use it to cheat. According to the citys education department the tool will be forbidden across all devices and networks in New Yorks public schools. Jenna Lyle a department spokesperson said the decision stems from concerns about negative impacts on student learning and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of contents. ChatGPT was created by OpenAI an independent artificial intelligence research foundation cofounded by Elon Musk in 2015. Released last November OpenAIs chatbot is able to create stunningly humanlike responses to a wide range of questions and various writing prompts. ChatGPT is trained on a large sample of text taken from the internet and interacts with users in a dialogue format. According to OpenAI the conversation format allows ChatGPT to answer followup questions admit its mistakes challenge incorrect premises and reject inappropriate requests. Users can request rephrasings summaries and expansions on the texts that it churns out. The decision to ban the chatbot in New York schools comes amid widespread fears that it could encourage students to plagiarize. While the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions it does not build criticalthinking and problemsolving skills which are essential for academic and lifelong success Lyle said. Nevertheless individual schools are still able to request access to ChatPGT for purposes of AI and technologyrelated education she added. Since New Yorks announcement OpenAI has tried to reassure teachers. The company told the Washington Post We dont want ChatGPT to be used for misleading purposes in schools or anywhere else so were already developing mitigations to help anyone identify text generated by that system. We look forward to working with educators on useful solutions and other ways to help teachers and students benefit from artificial intelligence it added. Last month OpenAIs CEO Sam Altman tweeted that ChatGPT is incredibly limited but good enough at some things to create a misleading impression of greatness. Its a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now. Its a preview of progress we have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness he said adding Fun creative inspiration great Reliance for factual queries not such a good idea. The chatbot has so far proved to be divisive among educators. The robots are here and theyre going to be doing our students homework warned educator Dan Lewer on TikTok. Lewer advises teachers to ask students who submit their essays at home to also submit a short and sweet video response in which they restate their thesis review some of their best evidence their best arguments their reasoning and then at the end I would have them reflect What did they learn from the essay what did they struggle with where did they think they grew. This will help students develop better communication skills while helping you ensure theyre really learning the material said Lewer.,2023-01-06T18:19:30Z
21,What 10 top AI stories in 2022 reveal about 2023,"VentureBeat's top AI stories of the year show that the industry’s advances — including, notably, in generative AI — are vast and powerful, but only the beginning of what's yet to come.",https://venturebeat.com/ai/what-10-top-ai-stories-in-2022-reveal-about-2023/,As we look back at VentureBeats top AI stories of the year its clear that the industrys advances including notably in generative AI are vast and powerful but only the beginning of what is to come. For example OpenAI the artificial intelligence research lab behind AI tools that exploded this year including DALLE 2 and ChatGPT debuted buzzedabout advancements that drew attention from the general public as well as the tech industry. DALLEs texttoimage generation and ChatGPTs new capabilities to produce highquality longform content made creatives question whether they will soon be out of a job and who owns the content these tools are creating anyway Meanwhile the next iteration of advancements may not be far off for OpenAI. This fall Ray the machine learning technology behind OpenAIs largescale operations debuted its next milestone Ray 2. 0. The update will operate as a runtime layer and is designed to simplify the building and management of large AI workloads which will allow companies like OpenAI to make even greater strides in 2023. Though generative AI led much of this years trending coverage it wasnt the only area of AI where waves were made that had a ripple effect. Intel unveiled what it claims is the first realtime deepfake detector which works by analyzing subtle blood flow in videos and produces results in minutes that are 96 accurate. Its a tool that may become increasingly useful to maintain integrity as generative AI video and image capabilities become even more realistic. Event Intelligent Security Summit OnDemand Learn the critical role of AI ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies. Watch ondemand sessions today. And AI continued to seemingly eat the world as we know it even the most mundane technology use cases as the most complex algorithms were reoriented with AIpowered improvements this year. Google released a beta version of Simple ML for its Google Sheets tool to revamp the platforms capabilities for calculations and graphing while DeepMind unveiled its first AI to power faster matrix multiplication algorithms which some say may be used to improve the entire computer science industry. Along with the strides made in AI this year several companies are heading into 2023 with fewer AI employees due to layoffs as a result of the declining economy including Meta. As part of its 11000 layoffs the technology and social media giant laid off an entire machine learning infrastructure team this fall which came as a surprise given the company said it plans to increase its focus on AI. While the future may be uncertain for some AI professionals in the short term experts dont anticipate that this will significantly impact AIs progress in the long run. There have been arguments that AI has in some respects hit a wall or slowed down to what one industry CEO referred to as a Stone Age. Others have fired back against claims like these including renowned computer scientist and artificial neural networks pioneer Geoffrey Hinton who told VentureBeat that the rapid progress were seeing in AI will continue to accelerate. Looking ahead Andrew Ng founder of Landing AI and DeepLearning AI told VentureBeat that the next decade of progress in AI will revolve heavily around its generative AI capabilities and shift toward datacentric AI. As we collectively make progress on this over the next few years I think it will enable many more AI applications and Im very excited about that Ng said in a previous interview. Progress is certain to continue but not without bumps in the road. As legislation around regulating AI continues to unfold it will be important for organizations to hire executives perhaps a chief AI officer who are knowledgeable about its benefits consequences and constantly evolving capabilities. Until then progress not perfection is what to expect for 2023. Heres more from our top 10 AI stories of 2022 Andrew Ng predicts the next 10 years in AI George Anandiotis wrote this March 21 story an interview with Andrew Ng founder of Landing AI and DeepLearning AI cochairman and cofounder of Coursera and adjunct professor at Stanford University. Ng told VentureBeat that much of the focus on AI throughout the last decade has been on big data. In decades to come he predicts a shift toward datacentric AI. Ten years ago I underestimated the amount of work that would be needed to flesh out deep learning and I think a lot of people today are underestimating the amount of work that will be needed to flesh out datacentric AI to its full potential Ng said. But as we collectively make progress on this over the next few years I think it will enable many more AI applications and Im very excited about that. Meta layoffs hit an entire ML research team focused on infrastructure Senior writer Sharon Goldman was up late at night scrolling through Twitter on November 9 the day Meta announced it was laying off 1000 employees. In a public statement Mark Zuckerberg had shared a message to Meta employees that signaled to some that those working in artificial intelligence AI and machine learning ML might be spared the brunt of the cuts. However Thomas Ahle a Meta research scientist who was laid off tweeted that he and the entire research organization called Probability which focused on applying machine learning across the infrastructure stack was cut. The team had 50 members not including managers he said. OpenAI debuts ChatGPT and GPT3. 5 series as GPT4 rumors fly As GPT4 rumors continued to fly at NeurIPS 2022 on November 30 OpenAI managed to take over the news with ChatGPT a new model in the GPT3 family of AIpowered large language models LLMs that reportedly improves on its predecessors by handling more complex instructions and producing higherquality longerform content. ChatGPT has been out for only a few weeks but hasnt stopped making news since its release. DeepMind unveils first AI to discover faster matrix multiplication algorithms It was considered one of the toughest mathematical puzzles to crack Could AI create its own algorithms to speed up matrix multiplication one of machine learnings most fundamental tasks In a paper published in Nature on October 5 research lab DeepMind unveiled AlphaTensor the first artificial intelligence system for discovering novel efficient and provably correct algorithms. The Googleowned lab said the research sheds light on a 50yearold open question in mathematics about finding the fastest way to multiply two matrices. AlphaTensor according to a DeepMind blog post builds upon AlphaZero an agent that has shown superhuman performance in board games like chess and Go. This new work takes the AlphaZero journey further moving from playing games to tackling unsolved mathematical problems. Google brings machine learning to online spreadsheets with Simple ML for Sheets On December 7 Sean Michael Kerner shared the news that Google was planning to bring machine learning to its Sheets tool. While simple calculations and graphs have long been part of the spreadsheet experience machine learning ML has not. ML is often seen as being too complex to use while spreadsheets are intended to be accessible to any type of user. Google announced a beta release of the Simple ML for Sheets addon. Google Sheets has an extensible architecture that enables users to benefit from addons that extend the applications default functionality. In this case Google Sheets benefits from ML technology that Google first developed in the opensource TensorFlow project. With Simple ML for Sheets users will not need to use a specific TensorFlow service as Google has developed the service to be as easily accessible as possible. 10 years later deep learning revolution rages on say AI pioneers Hinton LeCun and Li When senior writer Sharon Goldman realized that September 2022 was the 10year anniversary of key neural network research known as AlexNet that led to the deep learning revolution in 2012 she reached out to AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton. With interviews with Hinton and other leading AI luminaries including Yann LeCun and FeiFei Li this piece is a look back at a booming AI decade as well as a deep dive into whats ahead in AI. Will OpenAIs DALLE 2 kill creative careers OpenAI s expanded beta access to DALLE 2 its powerful imagegenerating AI solution sent the tech world buzzing with excitement in late July but also left many with questions. For one thing what does the commercial use of DALLEs AIpowered imagery mean for creative industries and workers Will it replace them According to OpenAI the answer is no. DALLE is a tool that enhances and extends the creative process an OpenAI spokesperson told VentureBeat. Much as an artist would look at different artworks for inspiration DALLE can help an artist come up with creative concepts. Since this article was published debate and criticism has continued about the ownership of images generated by AI. It certainly wont end anytime soon. Intel unveils realtime deepfake detector claims 96 accuracy rate On November 16 Intel introduced FakeCatcher which it says is the first realtime detector of deepfakes that is synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone elses likeness. Intel claims the product has a 96 accuracy rate and works by analyzing the subtle blood flow in video pixels to return results in milliseconds. With deepfake threats looming this type of deepfake detection technology is becoming ever more important. The question is does it really work Who owns DALLE images Legal AI experts weigh in In another installment of what has become an ongoing texttoimage generator drama senior writer Sharon Goldman explored the legal ramifications of tools like DALLE 2. When OpenAI announced expanded beta access to DALLE in July the company offered paid subscription users full usage rights to reprint sell and merchandise the images they create with the powerful texttoimage generator. A week later creative professionals across industries were already buzzing with questions. Topping the list Who owns images put out by DALLE or for that matter other AIpowered texttoimage generators such as Googles Imagen The owner of the AI that trains the model Or the human who prompts the AI Bradford Newman who leads the machine learning and AI practice of global law firm Baker McKenzie in its Palo Alto office said the answer to the question Who owns DALLE images is far from clear. And he emphasized legal fallout is inevitable. Ray the machine learning tech behind OpenAI levels up to Ray 2. 0 Sean Michael Kerner wrote this August 23 piece about the infrastructure that supports OpenAI Ray. Over the last two years one of the most common ways for organizations to scale and run increasingly large and complex artificial intelligence workloads has been with the opensource Ray framework used by companies from OpenAI to Shopify and Instacart. Ray enables machine learning ML models to scale across hardware resources and can also be used to support MLops workflows across different ML tools. The tools next major milestone debuted at the Ray Summit in San Francisco. Ray 2. 0 extends the technology with the new Ray AI Runtime AIR that is intended to work as a runtime layer for executing ML services.

22,ChatGPT and generative AI look like tech's next boom. They could be the next bubble.,"Startups implementing generative AI are already attracting big, early-stage rounds at hefty valuations — with little evidence they can become profitable.",https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgtp-and-generative-ai-could-form-techs-next-big-bubble-2023-1,ChatGPT and generative AI look like techs next boom. They could be the next bubble. The buzz behind ChatGPT is fuelling investment into other generative AI startups. In the last three months AI startups have raised big rounds at high reported valuations. OpenAIs release of ChatGPT and the immediate subsequent buzz has put generative AI on the map for venture capitalists and tech firms eager to put money into a smart idea in a downturn where smart ideas feel scarce. Generative AI is the catchall term for artificial intelligence that can create something new text or images for example from existing data when given prompts. OpenAIs generative AI tools can seemingly do anything from write poetry and code to producing frameworthy art triggering huge excitement in the space. And venture capitalists and companies want to get in early on tech that has the potential to be transformative especially at a time when most tech moonshots arent working out. For example Microsoft is weighing up whether to invest a further 10 billion in OpenAI at a 29 billion valuation according to reports having first invested 1 billion in 2019. AI copywriter Jasper AI raised 125 million in Series A funding in October high for an earlystage round at the tailend of dismal funding year for startups. And in December New Yorkbased Runway which uses AI tools to aid in video editing raised 50 million at a 500 million valuation. These are notably large individual deals and this year looks set to see the funding rush continue. But are we headed for an AI bubble Franois Chollet fchollet January 8 2023 The wild revenue multiples are here One sign of frothiness in private tech startups is whether their valuations seem out of whack with their business potential. Generative AI startups are already securing skyhigh valuations despite little evidence of commensurate revenue let alone profit reminiscent of the lowinterestrate boom times that saw firms with unproven business models fetch valuations worth billions of dollars despite having little to show. OpenAIs reported target valuation of 29 billion would be on revenues in the tens of millions according to the Wall Street Journal. That could mean a revenue multiple ranging from around 290x to 2900x. OpenAI is commercially promising thanks to its tieups with Microsoft but that is a big show of faith. Jasper AI secured a 1. 5 billion valuation from its recent round despite expecting to end 2022 with just 75 million in revenue according to TechCrunch a 20x revenue multiple. By way of comparison publicly listed enterprise AI firm C3 trades at around a 1. 3x revenue multiple. Another sign of a bubble is a cash rush. Pitchbook figures suggest VC investment in AI hit 1. 37 billion in 2022 across 78 deals globally representing almost the total invested over the past five years. How generative AI generates revenue is unclear All of this might be justifiable if there was a clear path for AI firms to make money. But the current state of AI is still expensive and profits are theoretical. Kyle Harrison kwharrison13 November 21 2022 For Dr. Richard Windsor founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile conclusions that ChatGPT is about to topple Google are premature. OpenAI he said is a long way from challenging Google particularly as the firm subscribes to what he calls the infinite monkey theorem of AI. In his view OpenAIs approach is one of If you throw enough data and enough compute at a problem then the answer will eventually pop out at the end. Consequently he said OpenAI uses a lot of computational power. In a research note Morgan Stanley analysts compared ChatGPTs costperquery to Googles costpersearch. At an estimated average of 0. 02 per query they estimated that OpenAIs costs are about seven times higher than Googles 0. 003 per query. The difference the analysts note is the significance of the compute intensity of ChatGPTs natural language models. They added that even if OpenAI has access to the lowestpriced tiers for Azure the Microsoft cloud service that hosts ChatGPT queries made on the AI chatbot would still be four times more expensive than an average Google search. Some of the hype around generative AI may be justified and the technology feels genuinely exciting. But to avoid another bubble investors would do well to quiz the fundamentals of generative AI businesses before handing out hefty valuations.

Educators concerned that the viral popularity of OpenAIs ChatGPT will lead to waves of genericsounding mostly AIwritten essays might have reason to relax. Princeton student Edward Tian devoted a portion of his holiday to writing GPTZero an application that can identify text authored by artificial intelligence. Tian posted a couple of proofofconcept videos on January 2nd demonstrating GPTZeros capabilities. First it determined that a human authored a New Yorker article then it correctly identified ChatGPT as the author of a Facebook post. heres a demo with nandoodless Linkedin post that used ChatGPT to successfully respond to Danish programmer David Hanssons opinions pic. twitter. com5szgLIQdeN Edward Tian edwardthe6 January 3 2023 Business Insider has more GPTZero scores text on its perplexity and burstiness referring to how complicated it is and how randomly it is written. The app was so popular that it crashed due to unexpectedly high web traffic and currently displays a betasignup page. GPTZero is still available to use on Tians Streamlit page after the website hosts stepped in to increase its capacity. Tians motivation for creating GPTZero was academic in nature over what he termed AI plagiarism. Tian tweeted that he thought it was unlikely that high school teachers would want students using ChatGPT to write their history essays. ChatGPTs creators at OpenAI have their own concerns about how their product is used. As the Guardian reported last week one researcher recently said in a talk at a Texas university that they want it to be much harder to take a GPT output and pass it off as if it came from a human. According to the Guardian OpenAI is currently working on a feature for statistically watermarking ChatGPT outputs so that machine readers can spot buried patterns in the AIs text selections.

OpenAI now has PointE which takes text or an image and produces a 3D model. You can find a few runnable demos online but good luck having them not too busy to work. We were not always impressed with the output. Asking for 3d printable starship Enterprise for example produced a point cloud that looked like a pregnant Klingon battle cruiser. Like most of these tools the trick is finding a good prompt. Simple things like a chair seemed to work somewhat better. Is this going to put 3D designers out of business We think it isnt very likely at least for engineering purposes. Unlike a visual image most 3D models need to be exact and have interfaces to other things. Maybe one day the AI can do like a Star Trek computer or replicator just making what you want from a hazy description. But for today it might be more useful to train an AI to examine an existing design and help identify problem areas for printing or improve support structures and orientation. That seems more realistic. On the other hand we understand this is the early days for these tools. But at the current state asking if this will replace humans is like wondering if parrots will replace radio disk jockeys. The writing and 3D modeling is generally not precise enough. If you wanted an artistic model or a piece of clip art you might be able to get away with using a tool like this. Still we are far from AI replacing a writer a photographer a graphic artist or a 3D designer for most practical purposes. Our opinion computers work best when they boost human creativity not replace it. Texturing for example. Our own Jenny List has taken us through the search engine aspects of AI too.,2022-12-26T15:00:00Z
25,New York City public schools ban access to AI tool that could help students cheat,"New York City public schools will ban students and teachers from using ChatGPT, a powerful new AI chatbot tool, on the district's networks and devices, an official confirmed to CNN on Thursday.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/05/tech/chatgpt-nyc-school-ban/index.html,New York City public schools will ban students and teachers from using ChatGPT a powerful new AI chatbot tool on the districts networks and devices an official confirmed to CNN on Thursday. The move comes amid growing concerns that the tool which generates eerily convincing responses and even essays in response to user prompts could make it easier for students to cheat on assignments. Some also worry that ChatGPT could be used to spread inaccurate information. Due to concerns about negative impacts on student learning and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content access to ChatGPT is restricted on New York City Public Schools networks and devices Jenna Lyle the deputy press secretary for the New York public schools said in a statement. While the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions it does not build criticalthinking and problemsolving skills which are essential for academic and lifelong success. Although the chatbot is restricted under the new policy New York City public schools can request to gain specific access to the tool for AI and techrelated educational purposes. Education publication ChalkBeat first reported the news. New York City appears to be one of the first major school districts to crack down on ChatGPT barely a month after the tool first launched. Last month While there are genuine concerns about how ChatGPT could be used its unclear how widely adopted it is among students. Other districts meanwhile appear to be moving more slowly. Peter Feng the public information officer for the South San Francisco Unified School District said the district is aware of the potential for its students to use ChatGPT but it has not yet instituted an outright ban. Meanwhile a spokesperson for the School District of Philadelphia said it has no knowledge of students using the ChatGPT nor have we received any complaints from principals or teachers. In a statement shared with CNN after publication a spokesperson for OpenAI the artificial intelligence research lab behind the tool said it made ChatGPT available as a research preview to learn from realworld use. The spokesperson called that step a critical part of developing and deploying capable safe AI systems. We are constantly incorporating feedback and lessons learned the spokesperson added. The company said it aims to work with educators on ways to help teachers and students benefit from artificial intelligence. We dont want ChatGPT to be used for misleading purposes in schools or anywhere else so were already developing mitigations to help anyone identify text generated by that system the spokesperson said. OpenAI opened up access to ChatGPT in late November. It is able to provide lengthy thoughtful and thorough responses to questions and prompts ranging from factual questions like Who was the president of the United States in 1955 to more openended questions such as Whats the meaning of life The tool stunned users including academics and some in the tech industry. ChatGPT is a large language model trained on a massive trove of information online to create its responses. It comes from the same company behind DALLE which generates a seemingly limitless range of images in response to prompts from users. ChatGPT went viral just days after its launch. Open AI cofounder Sam Altman a prominent Silicon Valley investor said on Twitter in But many educators fear students will use the tool to cheat on assignments. Darren Hicks assistant professor of philosophy at Furman University previously told CNN it will be harder to prove when a student misuses ChatGPT than with other forms of cheating. In more traditional forms of plagiarism cheating off the internet copy pasting stuff I can go and find additional proof evidence that I can then bring into a board hearing he said. In this case theres nothing out there that I can point to and say Heres the material they took. Its really a new form of an old problem where students would pay somebody or get somebody to write their paper for them say an essay farm or a friend that has taken a course before Hicks added. This is like that only its instantaneous and free. Feng from the South San Francisco Unified School District told CNN that some teachers have responded to the rise of AI text generators by using tools of their own to check whether work submitted by students has been plagiarized or generated via AI. Some companies such as Turnitin a detection tool that thousands of school districts use to scan the internet for signs of plagiarism are now looking into how its software could detect the usage of AI generated text in student submissions. Hicks said teachers will need to rethink assignments so they couldnt be easily written by the tool. The bigger issue Hicks added is going to be administrations who have to figure out how theyre going to adjudicate these kinds of cases.

But if Microsofts plan to power Bing with OpenAIs GPT technology is successful Ill probably start using it a lot more and I suspect others will too. BingGPT could be bad news for Google which has a nearmonopoly on search. When OpenAI launched the experimental ChatGPT late last year Google reportedly went into panic mode. From The New York Times Although ChatGPT still has plenty of room for improvement its release led Googles management to declare a code red. For Google this was akin to pulling the fire alarm. Some fear the company may be approaching a moment that the biggest Silicon Valley outfits dread the arrival of an enormous technological change that could upend the business. I wonder why Google didnt try to license the technology before Microsoft did It could be that Microsofts 1 billion investment in OpenAI back in 2019 gave it first dibs. Or it could be that Google has a similar technology that its keeping secret.,2023-01-04T09:24:53Z
27,“Please slow down”—The 7 biggest AI stories of 2022,Highlights from a year when generative AI went mainstream.,https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/please-slow-down-the-7-biggest-ai-stories-of-2022/,More than once this year AI experts have repeated a familiar refrain Please slow down. AI news in 2022 has been rapidfire and relentless the moment you knew where things currently stood in AI a new paper or discovery would make that understanding obsolete. In 2022 we arguably hit the knee of the curve when it came to generative AI that can produce creative works made up of text images audio and video. This year deeplearning AI emerged from a decade of research and began making its way into commercial applications allowing millions of people to try out the tech for the first time. AI creations inspired wonder created controversies prompted existential crises and turned heads. Heres a look back at the seven biggest AI news stories of the year. It was hard to choose only seven but if we didnt cut it off somewhere wed still be writing about this years events well into 2023 and beyond. April DALLE 2 dreams in pictures In April OpenAI announced DALLE 2 a deeplearning imagesynthesis model that blew minds with its seemingly magical ability to generate images from text prompts. Trained on hundreds of millions of images pulled from the Internet DALLE 2 knew how to make novel combinations of imagery thanks to a technique called latent diffusion. Twitter was soon filled with images of astronauts on horseback teddy bears wandering ancient Egypt and other nearly photorealistic works. We last heard about DALLE a year prior when version 1 of the model had struggled to render a lowresolution avocado chairsuddenly version 2 was illustrating our wildest dreams at 10241024 resolution. At first given concerns about misuse OpenAI only allowed 200 beta testers to use DALLE 2. Content filters blocked violent and sexual prompts. Gradually OpenAI let over a million people into a closed trial and DALLE 2 finally became available for everyone in late September. But by then another contender in the latentdiffusion world had risen as well see below. July Google engineer thinks LaMDA is sentient In early July the Washington Post broke news that a Google engineer named Blake Lemoine was put on paid leave related to his belief that Googles LaMDA Language Model for Dialogue Applications was sentientand that it deserved rights equal to a human. While working as part of Googles Responsible AI organization Lemoine began chatting with LaMDA about religion and philosophy and believed he saw true intelligence behind the text. I know a person when I talk to it Lemoine told the Post. It doesnt matter whether they have a brain made of meat in their head. Or if they have a billion lines of code. I talk to them. And I hear what they have to say and that is how I decide what is and isnt a person. Google replied that LaMDA was only telling Lemoine what he wanted to hear and that LaMDA was not in fact sentient. Like the text generation tool GPT3 LaMDA had previously been trained on millions of books and websites. It responded to Lemoines input a prompt which includes the entire text of the conversation by predicting the most likely words that should follow without any deeper understanding. Along the way Lemoine allegedly violated Googles confidentiality policy by telling others about his groups work. Later in July Google fired Lemoine for violating data security policies. He was not the last person in 2022 to get swept up in the hype over an AIs large language model as well see. July DeepMind AlphaFold predicts almost every known protein structure In July DeepMind announced that its AlphaFold AI model had predicted the shape of almost every known protein of almost every organism on Earth with a sequenced genome. Originally announced in the summer of 2021 AlphaFold had earlier predicted the shape of all human proteins. But one year later its protein database expanded to contain over 200 million protein structures. DeepMind made these predicted protein structures available in a public database hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory EMBLEBI allowing researchers from all over the world to access them and use the data for research related to medicine and biological science. Proteins are basic building blocks of life and knowing their shapes can help scientists control or modify them. That comes in particularly handy when developing new drugs. Almost every drug that has come to market over the past few years has been designed partly through knowledge of protein structures said Janet Thornton a senior scientist and director emeritus at EMBLEBI. That makes knowing all of them a big deal.,2022-12-26T13:00:11Z

ChatGPT has soared in popularity recently with some calling it the iPhone moment for AI given its mainstream appeal. ChatGPT can articulate short and longform responses when given a simple prompt such as to write an email essay message and more. The bot has seen its popularity grow with students and those in academia who have used it for research and assignments. ChatGPT is free to use on the web for anyone with an OpenAI account but it has inspired scammers and sketchy developers to take advantage of its popularity for illgained profit. One app in particular named ChatGPT Chat GPT AI With GPT3 gives the impression it is the official app for the ChatGPT bot but appears to have no affiliation to Open AI the creators of ChatGPT or the bot itself. The app charges users a 7. 99 weekly or 49. 99 annual subscription to use the bot unlimited times and eliminate intrusive inapp ads. The app and its bot are inconsistent sometimes providing generic or entirely irrelevant responses to a prompt offered by the user. The app is currently the second most popular productivity app on the App Store in the United States indicating it is rather popular. The app has nearly 12000 ratings with a number of positive and negative reviews. This is a fake app one review said. This is just faking openai endorsement and more bad stuff another user said. Despite its suspicious activity presence and soaring popularity the app has passed Apples App Store review process multiple times since its initial launch three weeks ago. The iOS App Store is full of folks putting ChatGPT into a paid wrapper with ambiguous language that would let you believe youre paying for ChatGPT pic. twitter. com3w0rK14E5I Austen Allred Austen January 7 2023 The developers behind the app named Social Media Apps Game Sports health Run Hiking Runing fitness tracking have other sketchy apps on the platform including an Activity Lock Screen Widget 16 app and BetterTrack Ride Hike Run Swim app. Apple is known to be facing a tough battle against scams and sketchy apps on the App Store with some raking in millions of dollars in revuene.

29,Microsoft will have to buy OpenAI in 2023,The power of platform network effects,https://www.thoughtfulbits.me/p/microsoft-will-have-to-buy-openai,Microsoft will have to buy OpenAI in 2023 The power of platform network effects The short version Its a simple dilemma AI benefits from network effects. If Microsoft integrates OpenAI into its products it will increase the capabilities of OpenAImore data training and apps. As AI features become musthave features Microsofts business success will increasingly depend on OpenAI. In the short run AI features would give Microsoft a competitive edge but in the long run those features would shift shareholder value creation to OpenAI away from Microsoft. Microsoft will have no choice but to acquire OpenAI or rights equivalent to ownership. The long version Following up on my earlier post it has now been publicly reported that Microsoft has been working with OpenAI about integrating their AI technology into Microsoft Office and into Bing httpsappleinsider. comarticles230107microsoftplansaddingopenaichatbottechtoproductivityapps httpswww. theguardian. comtechnology2023jan05microsoftchatgptbingsearchengine. If done well this would create immense value for Microsofts customers. Ive already talked about how extensively I use AI myself and how I no longer use Microsoft Word as its nowhere near as efficient as writing with AI assistance. These assistancetype features will rapidly become essential for any competitive product. However integrating AI from OpenAI creates a fundamental business challenge for Microsoft. Typing printing document sharing and so forththe base features of Microsofts productivity toolsare effectively commodity features now. Google Docs Apple PagesKeynoteMail and so on are perfectly fine substitutes for Microsoft Office. But those products have yet to demonstrate features that dramatically shift market share away from Microsoft Office. Google arguably has come the closest but even then many Google users still maintain licenses to Microsoft Office. AI could change thatand change it fast. How fast it changes though is orthogonal to the business dilemma. If AI features become the competitive battleground for knowledge worker productivity tools Microsoft will have to have those features plain and simple. But if it gets those features from a thirdparty company OpenAI that shifts value creation away from Microsoft and to OpenAI. This value transfer problem is seen over and over in business. Ironically Microsoft itself benefited from it with their original MSDOS deal with IBM for the IBM PC httpsthisdayintechhistory. com1106ibmsignsadealwiththedevil. With that deal for the MSDOS operating system Microsoft captured the network effects and value creation for owning the underlying software platform. The IBM PC business became just one of many hardware manufacturers. source httpscommons. wikimedia. orgwikiFileOriginalIBMPC285133233471129. jpg AI similarly has powerful network effects. OpenAIs current business model is genius. By allowing free usage of chatGPT they are getting millions of free employees all actively and eagerly providing more data and more training to the system. At the most fundamental level AI benefits from more data and training. Its one of the reasons why Google has been able to maintain a substantial lead in search until maybe now despite the billions of dollars Microsoft has invested in Bing. Google simply had more dataand specifically more usage data. Google had more queries than Bing and more clicks indicating what websites are better results than Bing. It was such a formidable advantage to overcome that Microsoft eventually resorted to outright just copying Google httpswww. wired. com201102bingcopiesgoogle. More importantly OpenAI is at its core a software platform for applications. They have done a great job creating easytouse and capable APIs for other companies to leverage in their products. Im using those APIs myself extensivelymore on that in upcoming posts. Being the fundamental AI platform will only further accelerate the network effect more apps on OpenAI means more data more training and better results for OpenAI which in turn will lead to more apps on the platform. Positive feedback loops are exceptionalexceptional for the loop owners and exceptionally difficult for others to disrupt. Microsoft knows this firsthand with Bing and recall that Satya Nadella Microsofts CEO was the executive in charge of Bing for many years. Even if competing AI platforms emerge and they will those competitive platforms must be exceptionally inventive to overcome the early lead OpenAI is achieving. Microsoft has outstanding inhouse AI talent and has invested in AI for decades. However all that talent does not change the network effect that OpenAI is enjoying now. So why has Microsoft yet to announce an acquisition They may well be already in discussions. Either way the internal debate is likely discussing the following dilemma if Microsoft buys OpenAI too soon it could open up the door for strengthening the competition. Its one thing for companies worldwide to rely on an independent thirdparty platform but those companies might pause before being solely dependent on Microsoft and want a viable alternative. We see a similar dynamic with Amazon and Shopify. If you are an ecommerce vendor there are a lot of advantages to being on the Amazon platform. But Amazon is aggressivedo you really want to build on Amazon if Amazon is going to learn from you and build competing products to your own Maybe its better to use Shopify and not have the competition from your platform provider httpswww. cnbc. com20220706amazoninvestigatedbyukwatchdogoveritsmarketplacepractices. html. Additionally there are countless examples of companies acquiring disruptive technologies too soonYahoos acquisition of Overture in 2003 is a particularly noteworthy example. Even though Overture at the time was dominant it did not stop Google from rapidly overtaking the search market httpswww. wired. com200702yahoo3. Even though Overture had by far the early lead Google learned from Overture and effectively built the better mousetrap. Conversely from a shareholder value creation perspective Microsoft would have a tough time justifying having their knowledge worker business depend on OpenAI as an external independent company. Microsoft is supposed to generate value for its shareholders not OpenAI shareholders The more OpenAIs AI technology becomes crucial to Microsofts business the more pressure there will be for Microsoft to acquire OpenAI. There would also be legal and regulatory reasons for Microsoft to acquire OpenAI. Many exciting use cases for AI in Microsoft Office involve analyzing or creating data e. g. writing assistance for documents or analyzing a spreadsheetdata that could be proprietary and confidential to a company. That customer data would need to be kept separate and isolated between customers in some fashion. Imagine an Airbus executive writing a business plan for a new airliner only to have the AI make suggestions that include the details of Boeings new airplane This privacy and rights problem for AI is a deep topic. For this note Ill simply comment that those challenges need both technological solutions as well as business solutions. Lets say a company is using OpenAIpowered Microsoft Office but sensitive PII customer data is sent to OpenAI in a way that violates European GDPR regulations. Who is liable How would that be handled Sure all sorts of contracts indemnifications and so forth could be crafted but at some point it would be much easier for Microsoft to simply own OpenAI. A subtle nuance here is Microsofts onebilliondollar investment into OpenAI httpsopenai. comblogmicrosoft. Microsoft has a highly talented business development team. Likely the OpenAI investment came along with contractual terms that would facilitate an acquisition or potentially make an acquisition by others more difficult. Those terms may enable Microsoft to postpone deciding on an acquisition. But at the end of the day if AI becomes fundamental to Microsofts business from a shareholder perspective they will have to buy. Of course for the completeness of the discussion Microsoft could construct a partnership agreement that effectively gives them the same value as an outright acquisition. It would be complex but conceptually possible. Such an agreement would need to result in Microsoft having rights similar to those they would enjoy as owners e. g. Google couldnt buy OpenAI and shut Microsoft off. Bottom line I am quite sure this discussion is happening now inside Microsoft. As an outside observer I think it would be a smart move for Microsoft. But regardless of the outcome its going to be an exciting year ThoughtfulBits Ideas that Matter is a readersupported publication.
