T…",https://www.engadget.com/meta-eu-fine-personalized-ads-163403318.html,Meta is facing yet another European Union fine. As hinted last month EU authorities are fining Meta 390 million about 414 million after determining that the company illegally required that Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp users accept personalized ads. The social media giant allegedly violated the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR by asking for permission to collect ad targeting data in its terms of service you have to either allow personalized ads or stop using the platforms altogether according to regulators. The EU didnt say how it expected Meta to obey the decision. However the wording suggests Meta will have to let users choose whether or not they accept personalized ads. In a statement Meta said it was disappointed by the ruling and felt its existing approach respects the GDPR. The firm plans to appeal the findings. The resistance isnt surprising. Meta has historically opposed attempts to decline personalized ads and predicted that Apples App Tracking Transparency which lets you ask apps not to track you could cost it 10 billion in lost ad revenue last year. Users behind proposed class action lawsuits have even accused Meta of trying to dodge Apples privacy feature by inserting tracking code through the inapp web browser. If Meta loses its appeal it risks losing a significant amount of revenue as people see fewer ads theyre likely to click. Its doubtful the EU will back down however. Irelands Data Protection Commission DPC which regulates Metas EU activity has repeatedly fined the company in the past year and a half. The DPC slapped Meta with a 405 million 402 million fine over Instagrams child privacy settings in September and in November issued a 265 million 277 million penalty for reportedly failing to protect users against data scraping. Officials want Meta to change its ways and this latest ruling only adds to the pressure.,Meta reconfirms its commitment to the metaverse,Somewhat Positive,70,"['criticized', 'loss', 'skepticism', 'disastrous', 'losing', 'criticizing', 'lack', 'rival']",[],"[Andrew, Bosworth, John, Carmack]"
2,Ireland fines Meta over $400 million for its targeted advertising practices,Ireland’s Data Protection Commission has issued two fines for how Meta handled Facebook and Instagram compliance with Europe’s GDPR.,https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23538750/ireland-dpc-meta-instagram-facebook-gdpr-violation-fines,Irelands Data Protection Commission DPC has fined Meta over its handling of user data following hundreds of millions of dollars in similar fines and potentially putting parts of its ad business at risk. The DPC announced today that Meta must pay 210 million around 222 million for violating European Union privacy rules with Facebooks practices plus 180 million around 191 million over similar violations with Instagram. The fines stem from two 2018 complaints about how Meta formerly Facebook complied with the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which went into effect that year. Both Facebook and Instagrams terms of service began requiring users to accept a new terms of service contract that included the processing of user data. But the complaints alleged that this amounted to forcing them to consent to things like targeted advertising in violation of the new rules. The DPC found that Metas updates had been insufficiently clear and after consulting with the European Data Protection Board EDPB it decided that Meta couldnt rely on the contract as an absolute defense of its business practices. The EDPBs guidance also led regulators to increase their planned fines for the company. In addition to the fines Meta must bring its operations into compliance with the GDPR within three months. Previous reporting by The Wall Street Journal indicated that Meta could face significant restrictions on its ability to conduct targeted advertising under the new rules. In a blog post Meta said it intended to appeal the decisions but it denied that they meant it would have to stop the practice. These decisions do not prevent personalized advertising on our platform. The decisions relate only to which legal basis Meta uses when offering certain advertising it said. We are assessing a variety of options that will allow us to continue offering a fully personalized service to our users. These fines come on top of several previous rulings that Meta violated European regulations. The DPC determined in November that Meta should pay 276 million over a 2021 data leak in September it issued a 402 million fine for how it handled teens Instagram data and in March it fined the company around 18 million for recordkeeping problems.,Meta fined $414 million in EU for requiring personalized ads,Extremely Negative,440,"['illegally', 'disappointed', 'resistance', 'decline', 'lost', 'loses', 'risks', 'losing', 'doubtful', 'penalty', 'failing']",[],"['harassment', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit']"

The company is rolling out a Variance Reduction System VRS in the US that ensures the real audience for an ad more closely matches the eligible target audience that is it shouldnt skew unfairly toward certain cultural groups. Once enough people have seen an ad a machine learning system compares the aggregate demographics of viewers with those the marketers intended to reach. It then tweaks the ads auction value that is the likelihood youll see the ad to display it more or less often to certain groups. VRS keeps working throughout an ad run. And yes Meta is aware of the potential privacy issues. It stresses that the system cant see an individuals age gender or estimated ethnicity. Differential privacy tech also introduces noise that prevents the AI from learning individual demographic info over time. The antidiscrimination method will initially apply to the housing ads that prompted the settlement. VRS will reach credit and employment ads in the country over the following year Meta says. The feature comes after more than a year of work alongside both the Justice Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Meta then Facebook was charged in 2019 with enabling discrimination in housing ads by letting advertisers exclude certain demographics including those protected by the Fair Housing Act. In a June 2022 settlement the social media giant said it would both deploy VRS and scrap the Special Ad Audience tool whose algorithm allegedly led to discrimination. Meta had already limited ad targeting in 2019 in response to another lawsuit. Meta isnt alone in trying to limit discriminatory ads. Google barred advertisers from targeting credit housing and job ads starting in 2020. However the tech used to fight that discrimination is relatively novel. It wont be surprising if other internet services implement VRSlike systems of their own so long as Metas AI proves effective.,Ireland fines Meta over $400 million for its targeted advertising practices,Extremely Negative,350,"['risk', 'complaints', 'complaints', 'violation', 'insufficiently', 'denied', 'leak', 'problems']",[],"['harassment', 'lawsuit']"

For many of us our accounts are filled with years of photos memories and memes that arent easy to part with even if we are ready to stop the daily scrolling habit. For Facebook Instagram and other Metarun services deleting an account entirely isnt necessarily straightforward either.

The Vive XR Elite is a 1100 flagship for VR and passthrough mixed reality MR. Although that pushes it far past the price range of the 400 Meta Quest 2 HTCs product compares more favorably on paper with the pricey Meta Quest Pro. The Vive XR Elite has a 4K display with a 90Hz refresh rate and a 110degree field of view FOV. It includes four wideFOV cameras enabling insideout spatial tracking without external sensors. The product ships with two wireless controllers and supports hand tracking. Additionally a fullcolor RGB camera allows passthrough MR that lets you blend virtual experiences with your realworld surroundings. The headset weighs 625g about 13 percent lighter than the Quest Pro including its hotswappable battery on the back. HTC says this placement helps balance the headsets weight. The battery provides an estimated two hours of use and supports 30watt fast charging via USBC. Additionally the headset has a builtin retractable charging cable on its right side making it easy to plug into a power bank or airline seat if you want to be the VR weirdo on your next flight. HTC says the XR Elite has large speakers supporting directional audio. In addition the headsets lenses have a dial that adjusts for prescription allowing visually challenged folks to take off their glasses before playing. Strangely HTC says you can remove the battery fit the headset with temple pads and wear it as regular glasses. That sounds like an odd fashion choice. The company also says an addon Face and Eye Tracker accessory will arrive later this year. Although HTC has a solid track record with VR hardware content and marketing are its biggest challenges. In the nine years since Meta Facebook at the time bought Oculus it has bought VR studios made exclusive deals with others and sunk countless advertising dollars into its brand. Although theres plenty to criticize about Metas business practices the company has stockpiled an unmatched library of virtual games and experiences. HTC has tried to compete with its Viveport subscription service but its headset still launches at a significant content disadvantage. Some of those content gaps can be filled with PC support. The XR Elite connects wirelessly or with a USBC cable to play PCVR games from Steam and Viveport. You can also stream content from a compatible Android phone to the headset to watch videos on a virtual big screen. Heres the complete list of supported phones. The company says you can also connect a Bluetooth controller to play gamepadfriendly smartphone games. HTC says 100 games and experiences will arrive within the headsets launch window. Listed launch titles include Demeo Hubris Yuki Maestro Les Mills Body Combat FigminXR Unplugged and Finger Gun. The company adds that Everslaught Invasion and the full MR game Eggscape will arrive later in the year. Engadgets Sam Rutherford is trying the headset later today and will share his impressions soon. Meanwhile you can preorder the Vive XR Elite from the company website starting today. HTC estimates that early purchases will begin shipping in late February.,How to permanently delete all your Facebook and Meta-owned accounts,Extremely Negative,200,['hang'],[],[]

While owners can still use the device and the apps available for it the Quest 1 will no longer be receiving new features. In addition Meta will only be rolling out critical bug fixes and security patches to the headset until 2024. As The Verge notes the device has mainly been getting the same updates as its successor over the past few years but now Quest 1 owners will have to make do with the features the device already has. Just got this email from Meta. Looks like the Quest 1s days are numbered pic. twitter. comQV3EPBXIuR blaze5161 blaze5161 January 9 2023 Its possible that Meta is having difficulties making sure new features are also working on the Quest 1s aging hardware. The company released the first headset back in 2019 when it was still known as Facebook and the device was still under the Oculus branding. Its powered by a Snapdragon 835 chip that was released in 2017 and was already two years old at that point. The Quest 2 was a huge upgrade when it came out in 2020 and its Snapdragon XR2 processor provided a significant power boost that enables it to play more complex games and experiences. That said the first Quest is also losing access to some abilities it already has Users will no longer be able to create or join parties going forward. Further users who have access to Meta Horizon Homes social features will no longer be able to access them starting on March 5th 2023.

Back in November reports came out that the ecommerce giant was eliminating 10000 jobs just as other companies in the tech sector had announced layoffs of their own. Now the company is expanding its job cuts and between the employees whod already lost their jobs and the ones losing theirs in the near future Amazon will be eliminating over 18000 roles in the company. Jassy said majority of the upcoming layoffs would be from its retail and recruiting divisions. As The Wall Street Journal notes Amazon benefited from the COVID lockdowns over the past few years since people had to shop online more often than before. The company reportedly added hundreds of thousands of employees to keep up with the surge in demand and then launched costcutting reviews to see which units werent making profit. It then froze hiring closed brickandmortar stores and shut down business units. When news broke that Amazon was planning sweeping layoffs Meta had also just revealed that it was letting more than 11000 of its employees go. Like Amazons executives Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg significantly increased Metas investments following a large revenue growth due to the pandemic. However peoples spending habits eventually went back to prepandemic trends leading to a smaller revenue for the company. More recently Slack owner Salesforce revealed that its cutting 10 percent of its workforce and closing down offices. The company also grew rapidly during the pandemic and cant sustain its bloated workforce in the current economy. Amazon will be cutting more jobs than Meta did by the time its done. Jassy said the company will reach out to impacted employees starting on January 18th so the layoffs will likely take place over the coming weeks. He added that Amazon will offer them packages that include a separation payment transitional health insurance benefits and external job placement support.,Meta's first Quest VR headset will no longer get any feature updates,Extremely Negative,230,"['critical', 'bug', 'difficulties', 'losing']",[],[]

European Commission tells Meta that Facebook Marketplace is unfair to rivals It abused its dominant position. Europe has hit Facebook owner Meta with a complaint that its Marketplace classified service is unfair to competitors. By tying its main social media site to Marketplace it has a substantial distribution advantage over rivals the EU Commission wrote in a press release. With its Facebook social network Meta reaches globally billions of monthly users and millions of active advertisers EU Antitrust Commissioner said in a statement. Our preliminary concern is that Meta ties its dominant social network Facebook to its online classified ad services called Facebook Marketplace. This means that users of Facebook automatically have access to Facebook Marketplace whether they want it or not. This all infringes on EU rules that prohibit the abuse of a dominant market position. The EU has the power to impose a fine of up to 10 percent of Metas annual revenue and prohibit the behavior. Metas head of EMEA competition said the claims made by the European Commission are without foundation.

O. The social network was penalized nearly 800 million last year in a series of charges for data breaches and privacy violations. While 2023 is young it isnt off to a good start. Irelands data privacy regulator on Wednesday fined Meta 419 million for improperly serving personalized ads without what it considered sufficient consent. European digital rules protecting customers leave room for more. In addition to the fines levied to date the Irish regulator has another 11 inquiries open into Metas services. Meta can perhaps avoid these and appeals could reduce fines. But other claims are close behind. In December the European Commission said preliminarily that the company breached European antitrust rules in tying its classified ad service to its Facebook social network. Worse Europes Digital Markets Act is gradually entering into force. The new rules offer dos and donts for firms like Meta that dominate industries in a way that make it far more painful for firms that do things like prefer their own offerings.

The lawsuit came in the wake of Facebooks revelation that it had improperly shared data on 87 million users with Cambridge Analytica a British political consultancy tied to former President Donald Trumps election campaign. Cambridge Analytica got its access to Facebook user data via an app developed by a third party. While only around 270000 Facebook accountholders used the This is Your Digital Life app the apps permissions allowed it access to data on those users friends. The end result was a dataset covering 87 million users that the developer than passed on to Cambridge Analytica in contravention of Facebooks terms of service. The vast majority of those in the dataset had not given the consultancy firm permission to access their data. The unauthorized data sharing came to light in 2018 when reporters from The New York Times and The Observer informed Facebook that Cambridge Analytica still had copies of the data even though the UKbased firm had promised the social network back in 2015 that the data would be deleted. Cambridge Analytica filed for bankruptcy in May 2018 after determining it was no longer viable to continue operating the business. The lawsuit against Meta continued on and other instances of problematic datasharing practices by Facebook were added to the complaint. Indeed the lawsuit accused Facebook of giving numerous third parties access to their Facebook content and information without their consent and alleged that Facebook failed to adequately monitor the third parties access to and use of that information. Meta is admitting to no wrongdoing or illegal activity by settling the case. Instead the company says the 725 million agreement which must still be approved by a judge is in the best interest of our community and shareholders a Meta spokesperson told Reuters. Up to 280 million Facebook users are covered by the settlement which means that 725 million is going to be spread awfully thin after the plaintiffs attorneys take their 25 percent cut.,Meta faces exsanguination by small fines,Extremely Negative,260,"['improperly', 'Worse', 'painful', 'recalcitrant', 'breakup', 'slower', 'breakup']",[],"[Robert, Cyran]"

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced what was originally called the Oculus Quest in 2018 as the premiere wireless VR headset. The company released the headset in 2019 so Meta is a little off in their letter when they said they launched the device over four years ago and this was all before Meta officially renamed the devices and its various services in 2021. So the Quest 1 is working off fouryearold tech and it would make some sense why Meta would not want to support aging hardware.

The company released the headset in 2019 so Meta is a little off in their letter when they said they launched the device over four years ago and this was all before Meta officially renamed the devices and its various services in 2021.

O has agreed to pay 725 million to resolve a classaction lawsuit accusing the social media giant of allowing third parties including Cambridge Analytica to access users personal information. The proposed settlement which was disclosed in a court filing late on Thursday would resolve a longrunning lawsuit prompted by revelations in 2018 that Facebook had allowed the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to access data of as many as 87 million users. Lawyers for the plaintiffs called the proposed settlement the largest to ever be achieved in a U. S. data privacy class action and the most that Meta has ever paid to resolve a class action lawsuit. This historic settlement will provide meaningful relief to the class in this complex and novel privacy case the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs Derek Loeser and Lesley Weaver said in a joint statement. Meta did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement which is subject to the approval of a federal judge in San Francisco. The company said in a statement settling was in the best interest of our community and shareholders. Over the last three years we revamped our approach to privacy and implemented a comprehensive privacy program Meta said. Cambridge Analytica now defunct worked for Donald Trumps successful presidential campaign in 2016 and gained access to the personal information from millions of Facebook accounts for the purposes of voter profiling and targeting. Cambridge Analytica obtained that information without users consent from a researcher who had been allowed by Facebook to deploy an app on its social media network that harvested data from millions of its users. The ensuing Cambridge Analytica scandal fueled government investigations into its privacy practices lawsuits and a highprofile U. S. congressional hearing where Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was grilled by lawmakers. In 2019 Facebook agreed to pay 5 billion to resolve a Federal Trade Commission probe into its privacy practices and 100 million to settle U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission claims that it misled investors about the misuse of users data. Investigations by state attorneys general are ongoing and the company is fighting a lawsuit by the attorney general for Washington D. C. Thursdays settlement resolved claims by Facebook users that the company violated various federal and state laws by letting app developers and business partners harvest their personal data without their consent on a widespread basis. The users lawyers alleged that Facebook misled them into thinking they could keep control over personal data when in fact it let thousands of preferred outsiders gain access. Facebook argued its users have no legitimate privacy interest in information they shared with friends on social media. But U. S. District Judge Vince Chhabria called that view so wrong and in 2019 largely allowed the case to move forward. The settlement covers an estimated 250 to 280 million Facebook users according to Thursdays court filing. How much an individual user receives will depend on how many people submit valid claims for a share of the settlement. Lawyers for the plaintiffs say they plan to ask the judge to award them up to 25 of the settlement as attorneys fees equaling about 181 million.

O must reassess the legal basis on how Facebook and Instagram use personal data to target advertising in the European Union its lead privacy regulator in the bloc said on Wednesday when it fined the social media giant 390 million euros 414 million for the breaches. Meta said it intended to appeal both the substance of the rulings and the fines imposed and that the decisions do not prevent personalised advertising on its platforms. The order on personalised advertising was made in December by the EUs privacy watchdog according to a decision seen by Reuters in which it overruled a draft ruling by Irelands Data Privacy Commissioner DPC Metas lead EU privacy regulator. It related to a 2018 change in the terms of service at Facebook and Instagram following the introduction of new EU privacy laws where Meta sought to rely on the socalled contract legal basis for most of its processing operations. Having previously relied on the consent of users to the processing of their personal data for targeted advertising the DPC said Meta instead considered that a contract was entered into upon acceptance of the updated 2018 terms and that this made such advertising lawful. The DPC which is the lead privacy regulator for many of the worlds largest technology companies within the EU directed Meta to bring its data processing operations into compliance within three months. Meta said it strongly believes that its approach respects EU privacy laws that allow for a range of legal bases under which data can be processed and that the decisions also do not mandate the use of consent for the processing of data. We want to reassure users and businesses that they can continue to benefit from personalised advertising across the EU through Metas platforms Meta said in a statement. The penalties brought the total fines levied against Meta to date by the Irish regulator to 1. 3 billion euros. It currently has 11 other inquiries open into Meta services. The DPC said that as part of its decision the EUs privacy watchdog had purported to direct the Irish regulator to conduct a fresh investigation that would span all of Facebook and Instagrams data processing operations. The DPC said it was not open to the European Data Protection Board EDPB to direct an authority to engage in such investigations and that it intended to ask the EU Court of Justice to set aside the EDPBs direction as it may involve an overreach. 1 0. 9423 euros Our Standards The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.,Facebook parent Meta to settle Cambridge Analytica scandal case for $725 million,Extremely Negative,400,"['scandal', 'accusing', 'defunct', 'scandal', 'misuse', 'wrong']",[],"['lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', Derek, Loeser, Lesley, Weaver, Donald, Trumps, 'lawsuit', Mark, Zuckerberg, 'lawsuit', Vince, Chhabria]"

As such the curtain is being pulled on the mystery behind the cash flowing through some of Silicon Valleys biggest companies. This past September California Governor Gavin Newsom officially signed Senate Bill 1162 into law which requires California companies with more than 15 employees to post a positions salary in its job posting. Likewise current employees can request the pay scale of their position from the company. New York City enacted a similar pay transparency law earlier this year with only minor hiccups and New York State has also signed a statewide pay transparency law. Senate Bill 1162 was specifically designed to tackle gender pay gaps according to quotes from Governor Newsom but an unintended side effect of the states transparency law is that it now sheds light on how much some of the worlds largest tech companies pay their workers. Gizmodo took a look at three random job openings each from Meta Apple and Tesla to find out how much these companies are paying for different positions. While job posting websites like Indeed do offer salary estimates these salary ranges are likely more accurate as they are straight from the horses mouth. Californiabased jobs at Meta pay Software Engineer Leadership Product at Meta requires 12 years of programming experience and 8 years of experience with web or mobile technologies 205000 to 281000 per year Data Scientist Machine Learning at Facebook requires at minimum a 197000 to 269000 per year Research Scientist Intern Computer Vision and Machine Learning for Messenger requires that the applicant either has or is in the process of getting a Ph.

The salary ranges on some of the positions are comically massive which probably isnt great for the potential employee if theyre being offered a job on the lower end. But it does give both the company and the job seekers wiggle room to negotiate. Each of these corporations had hundreds of job openings in California alone and Gizmodo took at look at a few more from each company. On the surface it appeared that Meta offered less entrylevel positions than Apple and Tesla. Tesla meanwhile seems to be leaning heavier into positions that pay hourly as opposed to annually. And while Tesla has positioned itself as a tech company theres been recent pushback among investors labeling it a carmaker not a tech firm.,No Headline,Extremely Negative,230,['Delay'],[],['lawsuit']
17,Your Oculus Quest 2 just got a performance upgrade overnight,Meta software engineers were able to pull some Christmas magic and give the Quest 2 a GPU upgrade in the latest firmware update.,https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/your-oculus-quest-2-just-got-a-performance-upgrade-overnight,Your Oculus Quest 2 just got a performance upgrade overnight HOW Its over 525MHz now What you need to know The December v47 update silently introduced a new performance boost on the Quest 2 which was enabled on December 22 2022. The Quest 2s GPU can now scale up to 525MHz when needed a boost up from the previous maximum of 490MHz. Meta says this equates to a 7 increase in overall performance which should help developers further enhance game detail resolution and performance. Its a Christmas miracle If you own a Meta Quest 2 or end up finding one under your Christmas tree this holiday season you can now enjoy the fruits of Metas labor as the latest firmware update just unlocked a GPU upgrade for the 2yearold VR console. The latest post on the Oculus developers blog opens in new tab informs readers that the GPU on the Quest 2 headset can now ramp up to 525MHz thats up from a maximum of 490MHz previously. Best yet that action can happen right now thanks to the December v47 update opens in new tab that rolled out two weeks ago. That means all those upcoming Quest 2 games opens in new tab will be able to take advantage of better graphics and more stable framerates as a result of the clock speed boost. This announcement comes hot on the heels of the departure of John Carmack legendary coder of Doom and other popular id engines and previous consulting CTO of Meta. Carmack left a strongly worded letter outlining the reasons for his resignation one of which was the general inefficiency of the current company structure of Meta and the companys inability to make simple changes in a timely manner. Whether this update is a coincidence or a quick turnaround to help answer Carmacks call to action is anyones best guess. Meta says this update should add roughly a 7 performance boost to any games when needed. Right now developers of the best Quest 2 games opens in new tab have to update their games to take advantage of the performance boost but Meta says its just a quick onoff switch. Starting in firmware v49 after the New Year the Quest 2 will automatically scale the GPU when performance dips. If an app is still struggling to meet the target framerate the Quest 2 will automatically begin using fixed foveated rendering opens in new tab when needed.

18,"The Oculus Quest 1 needs to die, but now is not the right time","Meta announced that it would start sunsetting major social features on the original Oculus Quest starting this March, with a final software update before 2024.",https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-oculus-quest-1-needs-to-die-but-now-is-not-the-right-time,The Oculus Quest 1 needs to die but now is not the right time Meta should wait until the Quest 3 ships later this year. Its been almost four years since the original Oculus Quest was released but Meta is ready to pull the plug on the aging standalone VR headset. In an email sent out on January 9 2023 Meta leadership explained that the original Quest will be officially sunset and will no longer receive software updates after January 1 2024. Even after that date all existing games and apps that work on an original Oculus Quest should continue to operate normally even after the final support date. If youre a PC VR player who uses an original Quest just for that purpose you should have no issue continuing to use it after 2024 if you so wish. Just got this email from Meta. Looks like the Quest 1s days are numbered pic. twitter. comQV3EPBXIuRJanuary 9 2023 Far sooner however is the fact that original Oculus Quest players will no longer be able to invite friends to their Meta Horizon Home environment or visit other players environments after March 5 2023. Given that this date is less than two months away and can be considered a newer major platform feature its a bit surprising to see Meta pushing it so far ahead of a likely October Meta Quest 3 opens in new tab release date. The writing has been on the wall for the Quest for a while as weve seen Quest 2exclusive games for the past 15 months since Resident Evil 4 VR launched as the original Quest 2 exclusive. Likewise activelyupdated games like Population One dropped original Quest support fairly recently because of the hardwares inability to run more advanced games at acceptable frame rates. While I wholeheartedly support the deprecation of the original Quest at this point its an ancient piece of hardware running 2017 tech Im not sure that removing social features before the Quest 3 arrives is the smartest move on Metas part. If Meta wants to do this it should absolutely wait until the end of the year when its nextgen headset is readily available for folks who want to upgrade. On that point if Quest 1 users are still actively using the headset and expecting to continue using these soontobeunavailable social features Meta is giving them only one option buy the 2andahalfyearold Oculus Quest 2. The problem here is obvious theyll be spending at least 400 opens in new tab on a headset thats going to be usurped in just a few months. Folks have this argument regularly with smartphones and other annually released electronics upgrades but the Quest isnt some annually released product. Its a gaming console and those dont often get replaced any sooner than 45 years at a time. As it stands it looks like Meta is starting to follow the Nintendo model of hardware releases. Historically Nintendo has introduced a new piece of hardware roughly every two years and it clearly has no issue with getting consumers to pay for them every single time. It does this without any sort of official tradein or upgrade program very much unlike the modern smartphone upgrade cycle where you can often get hundreds off of the best Android phones opens in new tab by turning in your old one. The reason they can get away with this aggressive hardware upgrade cycle is that Nintendo continues to support its hardware for years. Often these twoyear release cycles are iterative hardware updates that build upon a base hardware design. Switch Switch Lite and Switch OLED are three recent examples with previous examples building on the 3DS 2DS original DS and DSi models and plenty of others. With that said 2023 is absolutely the last year the original Quest should be supported. Like the Nintendo DS when it was released the original Quest was an incredibly underpowered device that performed well commercially because it innovated on game design and offered an experience that no other gaming machine could at the time despite the relatively poor visual experience. But unlike the original DS the original Quest doesnt have the user base to continue to sustain new game updates and releases and it doesnt make much sense for Meta to continue to support it given its continued restructuring plans. At this moment in time the Quest 2 has sold roughly 20x or more what the original Quest sold and that gulf is only likely to increase as the year wanes on. In addition to that the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chipset that powers the Quest 2 also powers brandnew headsets like the Pico 4 opens in new tab and even continues to power upcoming headsets like the HTC Vive XR Elite opens in new tab. In other words support for the Meta Quest 2 isnt going anywhere any time soon even with the rumors that the Quest 3s processor will be at least 100 more powerful. At the very least I suppose you could always take your Quest 2 into GameStop when the Quest 3 gets announced and trade it in for an upgrade. Thats really not a halfbad option even if you wont recoup most of the cost. January 9 2023 email to Meta employees We launched Quest 1 over four years ago and we are grateful to the Quest 1 community for pushing VR forward. As we look to the future we remain committed to supporting the community of Quest 1 users and will continue to support the headset with a few changes You will still be able to use your Quest 1 headset and available apps. We wont be shipping new features to Quest 1. We plan to continue maintaining the system software with critical bug fixes and security patches until 2024. Quest 1 users will no longer be able to create or join a party. Quest 1 users who currently have access to Meta Horizon Home social features will lose access to these features on March 5 2023. You wont be able to invite others to your Home or visit someone elses Home. Grab a Meta Quest 2 before your original Oculus Quest become obsolete.

Access to Metas Horizon Home features will also be cut off on March 5 the company wrote. And while Meta will no longer be delivering new features to Quest 1 users the company says it will continue to provide critical bug fixes and security patches until 2024. The announcement comes less than four years after the Quests initial launch as Metas then Oculus first wireless headset with full sixdegreeoffreedom head and handtracking. That initial version of the Quest which launched at 400 was succeeded by the 300 Quest 2 in late 2020. The Quest 2 reportedly sold tens of millions of units despite a 100 price increase last year. That relative sales success has meant many VR developers are increasingly targeting their games at the Quest 2s Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chipset and not the original Quests weaker Snapdragon 835. Metas announcement wont affect support for the Quest 2 at this point nor for the recently released 1500 Quest Pro. The original Quest sunset announcement comes less than a month after former Meta CTO John Carmack announced his departure from the company which he said was operating at half the effectiveness that would make me happy. Carmack was a major proponent of the original Quest within Meta and a booster of its untethered predecessor the Oculus Go which he unlocked via a postdiscontinuation update in 2021. In an October keynote speech Carmack warned that developers shouldnt design highend apps for the Quest Pro before crunching it down for the less powerful Quest 2.

PayPal Ticker PYPL YTD Performance 63. 4 Market Value Decline 142. 49 billion Like many tech companies the digital payments processor is seeing a slowdown after a pandemic boom. Net new accounts in the third quarter increased by 2. 9 million compared with 13. 3 million in the yearago period. CEO Dan Schulman told analysts the macro environment looks difficult in part with inflationary pressures in Europe and in the US and a potentially shallow recession in the US. The shares popped higher earlier in December however after Schulman reportedly said fourthquarter pershare earnings were tracking slightly ahead of its expectations. 9. V. F. Corp. Ticker VFC YTD Performance 64. 4 Market Value Decline 18. 6 billion The company behind The North Face Supreme Vans and other apparel labels rounded off a rough year for its stock with the unexpected departure of Steve Randle as CEO. The Denverbased company said this year its been navigating through a more disrupted global marketplace pockmarked by COVIDrelated issues in China and consumers facing economic uncertainty. 8. Signature Bank Ticker SBNY YTD Performance 64. 5 Market Value Decline 12. 4 billion We are not just a crypto bank and we want that to come across loud and clear CEO Joe DePaolo reportedly said at a Goldman Sachs investor conference this month. The banks shares have been hit as the socalled crypto winter has slashed the cryptocurrency markets value from its high of more than 1 trillion and crypto deposits at the bank have declined. Signature anounced plans to reduce cryptorelated deposits by 8 billion to 10 billion. The stock did rise on the midNovember day that Signature said its deposit relationship with collapsed crypto exchange FTX was less than 0. 1 of its overall deposits. 7. Meta Platforms Ticker META YTD Performance 64. 9 Market Value Decline 611. 17 billion Investors have largely pushed back on CEO and major shareholder Mark Zuckerbergs metaverse ambitions that led to the companys rebranding from Facebook last year. Its Reality Labs unit centered on virtualworld technology has lost nearly 20 billion since last year. One prominent investor has called on Meta to cut back on its Reality Labs investment. Well aware of the backlash Zuckerberg recently said 80 of Metas investments are still directed to its core social media business. The drop in Metas valuation has sliced more than 80 billion off of Zuckerbergs vast wealth which recently stood at more than 44 billion. 6. Tesla Ticker TSLA YTD Performance 65Market Value Decline 703. 12 billion The pummeling of the EV makers stock price this year knocked CEO Elon Musk from his perch as the worlds richest man. A few forces were at work here Musk himself blames the Federal Reserve for driving down Teslas valuation saying its aggressive rate hikes have pushed up US Treasury bond yields boosting the appeal of that lowrisk debt over relatively riskier assets. Meanwhile some investors and analysts say Tesla has been hurt by Musks sales of billions of dollars worth of Tesla shares and his focus on Twitter after his controversial 44 billion acquisition of the social media site in October. Supply chain problems in China have also been a pressure point although the company has been able to log record monthly sales during 2022. For those watching Musks net worth its fallen by more than 130 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. 5. Catalent Ticker CTLT YTD Performance 66. 1 Market Value Decline 15. 1 billion The contract manufacturer for pharmaceutical consumer health and biotech companies has worked on producing coronavirus vaccines for Moderna and Johnson Johnson. But with coronavirus infections slowing overall the company has flagged headwinds from COVIDrelated volume declines and last month cut its 2023 revenue projection to a range of 4. 63 billion to 4. 88 billion. 4. SVB Financial Group Ticker SIVB YTD Performance 68 Market Value Decline 27 billion Silicon Valley Bank is a good proxy for deal flow in Tech Bespoke Investment Group said in October as SVB shares plunged doubledigits following fourthquarter results. The company has cut its 2022 outlook for net interest income as its seen market challenges hitting liquidity flows to private companies and the overall tech landscape hurt by fears of recession and spiking borrowing costs. Its also been a rough year for innovative companies seeking to go public with the global IPO market volumes down 45. 3. Align Technology Ticker ALGN YTD Performance 69 Market Value Decline 35. 8 billion CEO Joe Hogan told Yahoo Finance earlier this year that high inflation and supply chain constraints pressured the company behind Invisalign clear braces. The shutdowns in China really hurt our business he said about its secondlargest market. He made his observations months before China recently began easing restrictions in its strict zeroCOVID policy with economists broadly saying that should reinvigorate growth there and perhaps reignite inflation. 2. Match Group Ticker MTCH YTD Performance 69. 3 Market Value Decline 26. 2 billion Shares of the parent company of Tinder Match. com Plenty of Fish and other dating sites have hit their lowest since publicly launching in 2015. The company has run into slowing revenue growth in part as younger and less affluent customers feel the pinch in their discretionary spending. Match says its visibility into 2023 is challenging. 1. Generac Holdings Ticker GNRC YTD Performance 73. 8 Market Value Decline 16. 6 billion Mass COVID lockdowns helped sparked big demand for backup generators as people worked and studied at home. The power systems maker has since seen residential sales slow while commercial and industrial sales have grown.

22,These 5 Big Techs have wiped out an eye-popping $3.65 trillion in market value over a torrid year for stocks,"Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta have each seen over $500 billion wiped off their market caps this year.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-crash-big-tech-amazon-apple-google-microsoft-facebook-2022-12,The Big Five tech stocks together have shed 3. 65 trillion in market value this year so far. Rising interest rates and the threat of a recession have fueled a brutal selloff in US stocks in 2022. Apple Microsoft Alphabet Amazon and Meta Platforms have each erased over 500 billion in market value. Just five Big Tech stocks have together lost 3. 65 trillion in market value this year as the Federal Reserves rapid interestrate hikes hammered the share price of some of the USs bestknown companies. Google parent Alphabet Amazon Meta Platforms Microsoft and Apple collectively seen as the Big Five tech stocks have each seen 500 billion erased from their market cap in 2022 so far according to data from Refinitiv. Those wipeouts have come in a year where the benchmark SP 500 stock market index has plummeted nearly 19 and the techheavy Nasdaq has plunged just under 32 as of Wednesdays close. The Feds aggressive interestrate hikes have helped fuel the slide in stocks overall but have particularly hit techs and other growth companies. The US central bank has raised its policy rate from nearzero in March to around 4. 5 by December to try to bring down inflation that has been running at fourdecade highs. Higher interest rates encourage people to save rather than spend and lift the cost of borrowing both of which drag on companies share price. And they tend to particularly weigh on stocks for fastgrowing companies like the Big Five as an increased cost of borrowing reduces their future cash flows which is the primary basis for their valuations. Facebook parent Meta and Amazon each suffered major hits to their market caps after they warned a recession in 2023 would lead to a fall in their earnings. Meta shares crashed 24 in a single day in October after it missed on earnings and flagged a slowdown in digital ad spending a risk mentioned by several in the online sector. The social media giant whose shift to the metaverse hasnt been well received by many analysts has shed 635 billion in market value this year according to Refinitiv. Its market cap stands at 318 billion after starting 2022 at 953 billion. Meanwhile Amazon plunged 11 the same month after it put out a gloomy sales forecast for the key holiday season. The online retail giant has wiped out 806 billion in 2022 so far losing its trilliondollar market cap for the first time since April 2020. Its at 885 billion now from 1. 691 trillion. Alphabets market value fell by 758 billion from 1. 921 trillion to 1. 163 trillion. Meanwhile Microsoft slipped from 2. 525 trillion to 1. 822 trillion for a drop of 703 billion. Apples total valuation tumbled 747 billion from its 2. 902 trillion level at the start of 2022. But it remains the worlds largest company with a market capitalization of just under 2. 155 trillion. Adding Tesla to the five Big Techs would take the groups total market value losses to 4. 2 trillion. The electricvehicle manufacturers share price has plummeted 61 this year as investors fret about the impact of Elon Musks Twitter takeover and an economic slowdown in China weighs on sales numbers. Thats wiped 572 billion off of Teslas market capitalization. This story was amended to correct the figure for the drop in market cap for Amazon.

23,Meta wasn't showing the elderly and women the same housing ads as everyone else. It now says its new ad-targeting algorithm won't discriminate.,A recent settlement is the first time that Meta has been held accountable by the federal government for its targeted advertising delivery system.,https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-says-new-ad-targeting-system-wont-discriminate-against-people-2023-1,Meta wasnt showing the elderly and women the same housing ads as everyone else. It now says its new adtargeting algorithm wont discriminate. Meta Platforms unveiled a new adtargeting algorithm on Monday that will impact housing and credit ads. The move comes nearly four years after the company was sued for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act. Facebooks parent company Meta Platforms launched a new adtargeting algorithm on Monday after settling a lawsuit filed by the US Department of Justice for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act. The move is the culmination of nearly four years of litigation and negotiations between the US government and the tech giant. These efforts began in March 2019 when the US Department of Housing and Urban development filed a claim against the company for enabling housing discrimination with its targeted advertising algorithms. Six months later a class action lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging that the platform discriminated against the elderly and women by not showing them the same housing and financial services advertisements as everyone else. In home sales and rentals the Fair Housing Act forbids the discrimination of anyone due to their sex religion color gender disabilities or familial status. Metas adtargeting algorithms have been regularly scrutinized for discriminatory practices. The company has also been investigated for allegedly contributing to widespread discrimination in employment and hiring based on peoples age and gender. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union have accused Meta of digital redlining by allowing advertisers to select the demographics of people they do and do not want their ads to be shown to. The ACLU filed an amicus brief in January 2022 arguing that these practices are a civil rights violation and that the company shouldnt be shielded from scrutiny because the discrimination took place online. Meta settled the lawsuit with the DOJ who sued the company on behalf of HUD in June 2022 and agreed to build a new adtargeting system as part of the deal. On Monday the company launched its new system called a Variance Reduction System for housing advertisements in the US. Meta said it plans to expand its use to employment and credit ads according to a blog post on the companys website. Meta added that it has also ended its use of its Special Ads Audience feature as of August 2022. The feature allowed advertisers to select specific demographic groups to target and distribute ads to for housing employment and loans. Across the industry approaches to algorithmic fairness are still evolving particularly as it relates to digital advertising the blog post reads in part. But we know we cannot wait for consensus to make progress in addressing important concerns about the potential for discrimination especially when it comes to housing employment and credit ads where the enduring effects of historically unequal treatment still have the tendency to shape economic opportunities. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke who leads the DOJs civil rights division said Metas new system represents a pivotal step in holding large tech companies accountable for discriminatory actions. Metas progress will be subject to federal oversight through June 2026 according to the settlement.

25,"Meta alleges surveillance firm collected data on 600,000 users via fake accounts","The social media giant launched an investigation into Voyager’s use of fake accounts after a Guardian investigationMeta has sued to block a surveillance company from using Facebook and Instagram, alleging the firm, which has partnered with law enforcement, cr…",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/12/meta-voyager-labs-surveillance-fake-accounts,Meta has sued to block a surveillance company from using Facebook and Instagram alleging the firm which has partnered with law enforcement created tens of thousands of fake accounts to collect user data. A complaint filed on Thursday asks a judge to permanently ban Voyager Labs from accessing Metas sites and comes after a Guardian investigation revealed the company had partnered with the Los Angeles police department LAPD in 2019 and claimed that it could use social media information to predict who may commit a future crime. Public records obtained by the Brennan Center for Justice a nonprofit organization and shared with the Guardian in 2021 showed that Voyagers services enabled police to surveil and investigate people by reconstructing their digital lives and making assumptions about their activity including their network of friends. In one internal record Voyager suggested that it considered using an Instagram name displaying Arab pride or tweeting about Islam to be signs of potential extremism. The lawsuit in federal court in California details activities that Meta says it uncovered in July 2022 alleging that Voyager used surveillance software that relied on fake accounts to scrape data from Facebook and Instagram as well as Twitter YouTube LinkedIn and Telegram. Voyager created and operated more than 38000 fake Facebook accounts to collect information from more than 600000 Facebook users including posts likes friends lists photos comments and information from groups and pages according to the complaint. The affected users included employees of nonprofits universities media organizations healthcare facilities the US armed forces and local state and federal government agencies along with fulltime parents retirees and union members Meta said in its filing. It is unclear who Voyagers clients were at that time and what entities may have received the data. But Voyager which has offices in the US the United Kingdom Israel Singapore and the United Arab Emirates designed its software to hide its presence from Meta and sold and licensed for profit the data it obtained the suit says. Our hope is to amplify this message that this is not the right way to police people or the public Jessica Romero Metas director of platform enforcement and litigation said in an interview. Some of the types of people that were impacted really dont fit the kind of criminal profile that Voyager tries to sell as the focus of their data collection and analysis. Voyager representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Some features that Voyager advertised in the records obtained by the Brennan Center posed significant ethical questions including one the company called an active persona which appeared to facilitate police use of fake profiles to gain access to otherwise private information on Facebook. In November 2021 after the internal records were revealed Facebook sent the LAPD a letter demanding that it cease all social media surveillance use of dummy accounts saying fake accounts were a violation of the companys policy requiring that people use their real names. The Metaowned platform also said at the time that using data obtained from the platform for surveillance including the processing of platform data about people groups or events for law enforcement or national security purposes was prohibited. While it is unclear whether the LAPD ultimately used the fake profile feature while working with Voyager emails showed that officers said it was a great function and a needtohave service. Voyager is a part of a broader industry of betterknown players like Palantir that purport to make crime predictions based on past behaviors and activity including those shared on social media. While the practice has been criticized by privacy and civil liberty advocates as pseudoscience that does little more than perpetuate bias and discrimination in policing law enforcement continues to be eager to acquire solutions that purport to make their jobs more efficient and in turn validate their decisions. And tech firms working to offset the industrys slowing growth have increasingly answered law enforcements call for new surveillance and policing products. This is an industry that has a lot of technical capabilities some of which are pretty sophisticated and yet theres no oversight or accountability Romero said. We view this as us doing our part to bring to light the kinds of information and conduct weve uncovered. Rachel LevinsonWaldman managing director of the Brennan Centers liberty and national security program said Metas lawsuit demonstrated how software tools like Voyagers can enable mass scraping of data Its a really wide range of people who have been affected by this and the public should notice and be alarmed by the scope of this kind of collection. She said the case could also have an impact beyond Voyager and should discourage police from pursuing these kinds of technologies It sends a pretty clear signal generally to the surveillanceforhire industry that they could face legal action and I hope it also sends a signal to police departments and other law enforcement agencies that are considering these tools.,"A Meta employee said they eat all their meals for free at the office, which is like 'teleporting to another universe'",Extremely Negative,350,['incorrect'],"['Blind', 'Blind', 'Blind']",[]
26,Meta dealt blow by EU ruling that could result in data use ‘opt-in’,Irish regulator fines Facebook owner €390m after EU rejects argument for use of data to drive personalised adsMeta has had a blow dealt to its business model by an EU decision that could force the Instagram and Facebook owner to ask users to “opt-in” to havin…,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/04/meta-dealt-blow-eu-ruling-data-opt-in-facebook-instagram-ads,The business model of Mark Zuckerbergs Meta empire has been dealt a blow following a ruling that its legal justification for targeting users with personalised ads broke EU data laws. Campaigners said the move could force the Facebook and Instagram owner to ask users to opt in to having their data used for targeted ads. Irelands Data Protection Commission DPC has fined Meta a total of 390m 343m after the EUs data authority rejected the companys argument that users agree to receive ads based on their personal data when they enter into a contract with its social media platforms via the terms and conditions they sign. A core part of the Facebook and Instagram business model is compiling profiles of users from their online activity which enables advertisers to target people based on details such as their hobbies consumer behaviour and location. The DPC had initially backed Metas legal argument that the contract approach did not breach the EUs general data protection regulation GDPR but it said on Wednesday it had to follow the binding recommendations of the blocs European Data Protection Board which is comprised of all EU privacy regulators. However the DPC which has regulatory power over Meta because the companys EU base is in Dublin added that it was seeking a court ruling against a further EDPB demand that it investigate all of Facebook and Instagrams data processing operations. The privacy campaign group Noyb which triggered the decision after lodging complaints against Meta said the outcome was a huge financial blow to the company which relied on advertising for 98 of its 118bn 98bn turnover in 2021. Max Schrems the honorary chair of Noyb said Facebook and Instagram users in the EU would now need to be asked whether they wanted their data to be used for ads. This is a huge blow to Metas profits in the EU he said. People now need to be asked if they want their data to be used for ads or not. They must have a yes or no option and can change their mind at any time. The decision also ensures a level playing field with other advertisers that also need to get optin consent. The DPC has given Meta three months to bring its data processing operations into compliance with the decision which imposed a fine of 210m for the Facebook GDPR breach and 180m for Instagram. It did not give details of how Meta should comply with the decision. Meta said in a statement it would appeal against the decision and that it was incorrect that personalised ads could no longer be offered without users consent following the DPC announcement. These decisions do not prevent targeted or personalised advertising on our platform said Meta. The decisions relate only to which legal basis Meta uses when offering certain advertising. Advertisers can continue to use our platforms to reach potential customers grow their business and create new markets. Metas advertisingbased business model is already under pressure after Apple introduced a privacy change that required app developers to seek user permission to track their online activity in order to serve them personalised ads. The companys shares slumped in October last year after a grim earnings report in which it flagged an advertising slowdown. It is also struggling to convince investors about its multibilliondollar investment in the metaverse a concept where the physical and digital worlds combine via virtual and augmented reality.,"Meta alleges surveillance firm collected data on 600,000 users via fake accounts",Extremely Negative,800,"['sued', 'fake', 'complaint', 'extremism', 'fake', 'fake', 'complaint', 'unclear', 'fake', 'fake', 'violation', 'unclear', 'fake', 'criticized', 'bias', 'discrimination', 'oversight', 'alarmed', 'discourage']","['crime', 'Arab', 'Arab', 'criminal', 'crime']","['lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'harassment', Jessica, Romero, Romero, Rachel, LevinsonWaldman, 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit']"

From February advertisers will no longer be able see a users gender or the type of posts they have engaged with as a way of targeting adverts to them. Under the enhanced restrictions only a users age and location will be used to show them advertising Meta said. The social media firm also confirmed that new controls would be introduced in March enabling teenagers to go into the settings in both apps and choose to see less of certain types of adverts. Many online safety campaigners say social media platforms need to do more to control the types of advertising shown to younger users saying inappropriate ads can cause as much harm as offensive or abusive content posted by others. Meta has previously added restrictions that stop advertisers from targeting teenagers with adverts based on their interests and activities and the company said the latest updates came in response to research on the issue direct feedback from experts and global regulation. As part of our continued work to keep our apps ageappropriate for teens were making further changes to their ad experiences Meta said in a blogpost. We recognise that teens arent necessarily as equipped as adults to make decisions about how their online data is used for advertising particularly when it comes to showing them products available to purchase. For that reason were further restricting the options advertisers have to reach teens as well as the information we use to show ads to teens. This isnt the first time Meta has been forced to look at its impact on its teenage users. Irish regulators launched a twoyear investigation into whether Instagram exposed the contact information of its underage users by allowing them to publicly post their phone numbers and email addresses when they switched to a business account in 2020. In September 2022 Meta was fined 405m 492m for violating the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen also first revealed to the Wall Street Journal in September 2021 that the company knew and had conducted research that showed that its photosharing app Instagram had a harmful impact on the mental health of teen girls. In a blog post responding to the article Instagram head of public policy Karina Newton said that the company takes the findings seriously but contended social media wasnt inherently good or bad for people.

Even before Elon Musks chaotic takeover the platform was long plagued by misinformation hate speech harassment and other ills that made it less than welcoming. Theres never been a better time to quit Twitter. The Elon Muskinduced chaos at the company has breathed new life into a crop of alternative platforms and has inspired a new wave of competing efforts to win over disillusioned Twitter users. Competition emerges Of all the alternatives out there none have benefited as much as Mastodon. The opensource service was created in 2016 and first gained notoriety in 2017 when some Twitter users were upset with changes the company had made to the functionality of replies. At that time though it didnt gain much traction outside a small base of hardcore enthusiasts. That all changed from the second Musk announced he wanted to buy Twitter. Mastodon saw an immediate spike back in April and the momentum has only increased according to the nonprofit. Mastodon has recently exploded in popularity jumping from approx. 300K monthly active users to 2. 5M between the months of October and November with more and more journalists political figures writers actors and organizations moving over founder Eugen Rochko wrote in a recent blog post. The service isnt a perfect analog to Twitter. Its platform which runs on thousands of servers can make signing up a bit confusing. And a couple of the platforms most popular servers like mastodon. social have at times halted new signups due to surging demand. But as Rochko points out the decentralized platform has become one of the top platforms of choice for some of Twitters most influential and most followed users. Tellingly when Musk briefly imposed a ban on accounts promoting alternative social networks Mastodons official Twitter account was the only social app to be suspended. Mastodon is far from the only previouslyniche app to get a boost from turmoil at Twitter. Other apps like CounterSocial which has a Tweetdecklike interface and Tribel which describes itself as a prodemocracy Twitter alternative have also seen an uptick in signups. Theres also a wave of competition from fresh upstarts. Post News a new service from former Waze CEO Noam Bardin has also tried to capitalize on Twitters dysfunction. The service which is currently invitationonly rushed to launch an early version of its beta in November in hopes of drawing away disillusioned Twitter users. Post which bills itself as a place to discover read watch discuss and share premium news content without subscriptions or ads has more than 610000 people on its waitlist according to Bardin. Another app thats emerged seemingly out of nowhere is Hive Social an imagecentric platform with a feed that looks more like Instagram than Twitter. The service was founded in 2019 and hit 1. 5 million users in November according to the company. The site has had some notable security issues which it claims to have fixed but has still managed to make an impression with Gen Z Twitter users. Legacy platforms are also trying to seize the opportunity created by growing apathy for Twitter. Tumblr claimed to see a surge in new and returning users according to Matt Mullenweg CEO of parent company Automattic. The site has also made a habit of trolling Musk and his new policies for Twitter including with the addition of a 7. 99 Important Blue Internet Checkmark for users blogs. Mullenweg has also said Tumblr will adopt ActivityPub the protocol powering Mastodon to make the two services interoperable. Meta is also keen to challenge its longtime rival. The company recently launched a new Notes feature within Instagram that allows users to share status updates at the top of their inbox. At 60 characters its hardly a fullfledged Twitter alternative but it might not be the last such feature we see from Meta. The New York Times reports that the company has discussed several ideas to go after Twitters bread and butter. The future for Twitter Quitters Its hardly the first time that unpopular decisions within Twitter have sparked an interest in alternatives. But in the past surges to outside platforms have been relatively short lived. And most wouldbe competitors are still only a fraction of the size of Twitter.
