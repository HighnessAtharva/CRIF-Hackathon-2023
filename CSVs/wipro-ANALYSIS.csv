6,IT Q3FY23 earnings kick off on Jan 9: What to watch out for,"The earnings season kicks off with TCS on January 9, followed by Infosys and HCLTech on January 12 and Wipro on January 13.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/it-q3fy23-earnings-kick-off-on-jan-9-what-to-watch-out-for-9822341.html,IT majors Tata Consultancy Services TCS Infosys Wipro and HCL Tech are set to announce their Q3FY2023 results next week. Analysts expect growth to be impacted by seasonal factors as well as macro indicators. The third quarter is a seasonally weak quarter for IT companies due to fewer working days as well as furloughs. This time itll be further impacted by the deteriorating macro. 1. Revenue growth Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said they expect muted revenue growth of 03 percent and revenue growth will moderate to high singledigits to low teens on a yearonyear YoY basis. The moderation they said will be due to the slowdown in segments like mortgages hitech and retail and telecom. It said that furloughs have been higher than usual particularly in the hitech segment after escaping their impact over the last two years. Emkay Global in a note said that revenue growth is expected to moderate on account of furloughs lower number of working days deferred spending by a few clients and increased cautiousness among clients amid macro uncertainties and high inflationary environment. Emkay expects CC revenue growth of 0. 83. 7 percent for tier1 companies and 0. 4 to 3. 4 percent for midcap companies. We expect the usual seasonality in H2 growth to be amplified by slower decision making and weak discretionary spending due to macro uncertainties it said. 2. Furloughs.. We expect revenue growth to reset from midteens to mid to high single digits from tight tech budgets and pricing pressure after higherthanexpected furloughs in Dec 2022 analysts at JP Morgan said in a note. Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said that weakness is expected to be accentuated by companyspecific disappointments due to higher furloughs primarily in the BFSI and hitech sectors. According to JP Morgan commentaries from companies suggest that furloughs in Q3FY23 will also drag into Q4 due to clients being cautious which implies a destruction in demand. 3. Margins Emkay Global said margins are expected to expand 20100 bps sequentially for tier1 companies and 2050 bps for tier2 companies. While margins will improve on a QoQ basis for the entire coverage universe we think they will disappoint visvis prior expectations. There will be pressure from weakerthanexpected revenue growth lower utilisation QoQ tailend of wage pressures higher travel and higher sales and marketing spends a note by Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities read. Thus while we expect QoQ CC revenue growth for players under our coverage at 13. 5 percent and QoQ margin improvement the investor focus is more on FY24. The Q4FY23 commentary will be keenly evaluated to see how the new year starts off the note added. However Motilal Oswal said that the weakening macros and recessionary fear has had had lesser adverse impact on the overall demand environment than it was anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. It expects some margin improvement in Q3. Though improved utilisation billable freshers and favorable FX for some companies are likely to provide some margin tailwinds the same will be partly offset by the adverse impact from furloughs and higher proportion of cost takeout deals it said. 4. IT Spends For the full calendar year Kotak expects moderation in IT spending and that IT services managements may not have full visibility. It expects TCS and HCL Tech to report a relatively better quarter while Tech Mahindra and Mphasis are expected to lag. According to ICRA Indian IT services are susceptible to macroeconomic uncertainties and adverse regulatory changes in key operating markets it operates in as it generates 6065 percent revenues from the US market and 2025 percent from the European market. Growth in the BFSI segment one of the key segments for IT companies has tapered more than other segments in recent quarters and this is partially attributable to lower lending activity. Moreover if the macroeconomic headwinds persist mortgage lending and the retail segments are expected to witness relatively higher moderation in growth compared to the manufacturing and healthcare segments. While the current healthy order book position from clients will support a healthy growth over the near term the evolving macroeconomic situation is likely to result in lower order inflows going forward said Deepak Jotwani Assistant Vice President Sector Head ICRA. BNP Paribas on the other hand said that while the macro backdrop is uncertain lateral data suggests IT spending will be resilient and that mediumtolongterm growth drivers are intact. Kotak Institutional Equities said it expects Infosys to retain its guidance of 1516 percent CC revenue growth and 2122 percent as EBIT margin for FY23. HCL Tech is also expected to retain its guidance of 13. 514. 5 percent revenue growth and 1819 percent revenue guidance. For Q4FY23 it expects Wipro to guide 13 percent revenue growth. 5. Guidance,"

Coming on the heels of the disruption to the global economy from the Covid pandemic Russias invasion of Ukraine rising inflationand as a result central banks beginning to raise interest ratesall had investors worried. Escalating tensions between the US and China was another concern. Tech stocks led a rout in the worlds biggest stock markets in 2022. By midOctober seven of the biggest tech companies of which Facebook Apple Amazon Netflix and Google sometimes referred to as FAANG plus Tesla had lost more than 3 trillion in their combined market value. Google and Microsoft had lost roughly 700 billion each and Facebook now Meta 600 billion. About a month later it got worse with Amazon becoming the first public companynot just a tech businessto lose a trillion dollars in market value. Bloomberg reported on November 12 that the ecommerce and cloud computing giants market value had gone from 1. 88 trillion to 879 billion. Microsoft wasnt far behind having lost 889 billion Bloomberg reported. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg on November 9 announced the company is laying off 11000 employees accounting for about 13 percent of its workforce in a costcutting measure. This lastresort measure became necessary because the prediction at the beginning of Covid that the accelerated shift to online would be permanent turned out to be wrong Zuckerberg said in a blog post. Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends but the macroeconomic downturn increased competition and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than Id expected. I got this wrong and I take responsibility for that he said. In the second week of December as this copy goes to print those market values arent much different. Meta Platforms Facebooks parent company has lost twothirds of its value from the beginning of the year. Tesla for example was lower as of December 7 than in Octoberthe company has seen recalls in China and CEO Elon Musk is also running Twitter which he purchased. Only Apple is relatively unscathed as demand for its entire product portfolio remains strong while Covidrelated disruptions to manufacturing in China have hurt its sales. The company had lost about 22 percent of its market value as of December 7 from the beginning of the year. In India too the biggest tech names the top IT services companies all saw their market caps eroded. The share price of the biggest company Tata Consultancy Services for example fell from more than Rs 4000 on January 17 to less than Rs 3000 on July 15.

This comes as the company reported its first net headcount decrease in ten quarters amid a challenging demand environment. According to Gopinathan the company doubled its typical trainee intake during the quarters of increased demand in the 2021 calendar year. In fiscal year 2021 when the industry went through a demand spike we had called it early that we expect the demand will return strongly by December 2020 and onwards. We significantly increased campus offers and offcampus hiring in the 2021 calendar year. When I say significantly we had more than doubled our typical intake he said adding that the company invested at the bottom of the pyramid trained them and deployed them simultaneously to backfill peak attrition rates. In the seven quarters preceding FY23 the companys net addition had increased each quarter to keep pace with the demand. Also read Level of tolerance between a disaster quarter and a great quarter is 50 basis points TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan In Q3FY23 TCS headcount closed down 2197 employees from the previous quarter. The last time the headcount addition was in the negative was in Q1FY21 during the first wave of the pandemic. As of December 31 2022 the company had 613974 employees on its rolls. Explaining the headcount reduction Gopinathan said that between December 2021 to December 2022 period the company had added between 5500060000 employees on a net basis. In 2021 he said they decided to bring in all their trainees in two quarters rather than spreading it throughout the year and took in 35000 freshers he said. We tested whether well be able to absorb it and how does it play out for us We had done such experiments a couple of years before the pandemic and then went on to a normal cycle. So we knew that we could flex this system he said. He added that headcount growth in 2021 was ahead of revenue growth and that headcount growth in 2021 and 2022 together is roughly in line with revenue. However the period during which TCS doubled its campus hires intake was also marked by elevated attrition levels across the industry. Gopinathan said that TCS approach was that as attrition increased they must invest at the bottom of the pyramid and train them so that the company has the people available to backfill that attrition. At the peak attrition levels we needed to be much more focused on lateral recruitment to backfill it. But what is really happening is the pool that we hired in calendar 2021 is becoming much more productive. And we are backfilling attrition using that pool rather than lateral he said. Now Gopinathan said that they will resume their regular hiring cycle. Attrition too has begun to moderate. While it was 21. 3 percent in Q3FY23 down from 21. 5 percent the previous quarter the companys management stated that quarterly annualised attrition has decreased by nearly 6. The company hired around 7000 freshers in Q3FY23 taking the total number of freshers hired this fiscal to around 42000. Gopinathan said that attrition is not backfilled from the current hiring but from previous hiring internal resources and lateral hiring. As attrition comes into control our ability to backfill attrition with internally trained resources increases. When attrition peaks you need to backfill laterally. But we are able to do that he said. He added that attrition moderating is important for TCS business model. It improves operational stability as delivery quality customer satisfaction everything is high when attrition is low. Its very critical to our business model plus the cost benefit of that. When youre doing lateral hiring in a much accelerated manner price points become unreasonable. Now it is much more rational he said. During the analyst call too Gopinathan stated that the hiring trend should be more normal from here on with a gross employee addition of 1. 251. 5 lakh expected for the year. Along with lower attrition rates he added that this will give the company enough capacity to handle growth and they can bring in talent on a shortterm basis depending on demand. The company currently has over 1. 25 lakh employees at the mid and senior levels who have been with the company on average for over a decade.," Stocks to Watch Today: Cipla, Eicher Motors, Elin Electronics, Lotus, RIL, and Others",Extremely Positive,90,"['Limited', 'issue', 'Stark', 'Stark', 'falling']",['drug'],"[Lalit, Behari, Singhal]"
24,"IT Sector Preview: EBIT margin to look up but lack of growth, flat deal wins to weigh","IT companies, which generate most of their revenue from export of services, are likely to be impacted due to recessionary pressure in the US â their biggest market â and other western nations.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/it-sector-preview-ebit-margin-to-look-up-but-lack-of-growth-flat-deal-wins-to-weigh-9810341.html,Muted weak and soft. These are some of the words that analysts are throwing up to project earnings for IT service providers for the quarter ended December 2022. The trend highlights the start of perhaps a long winter for them. IT companies which generate most of their revenues from export of services are likely to be impacted due to recessionary pressure in the US their biggest market and other western nations. We see potential for negative surprises across the board on revenue led by higher furloughs and pressure on the existing book of business said Nitin Padmanabhan an analyst at Investec Securities. Earnings commentary from Accenture last month was foreboding. IT companies have also reduced their expectations themselves. However there are some hopes that top names may maintain their growth guidance. Revenue stagnation IT companies have just come through their golden period as the increased tech adoption during pandemic led to a rapid revenue growth. Though things are not looking up from here they are also not looking down. We expect muted revenue growth of 03 percent quarter on quarter for our coverage universe said Kawaljeet Saluja an analyst at Kotak Institutional Equities. Revenue growth will moderate to highsingle digits to lowteens on YoY comparison. Also read Accenture secondquarter forecast disappoints as IT spending weakens Saluja said the EBIT margin of IT firms that was contracting for a few quarters now will likely improve albeit moderately. TCS and HCL Tech should report relatively better quarter while Tech Mahindra and Mphasis should lag he added. Dipesh Mehta of Emkay Global echoed the observation. We expect the revenue growth momentum to moderate in Q3 on account of furloughs lower number of working days deferred spending by few clients and increased cautiousness among clients amid macro uncertainties and high inflationary environment he said. Mehta expects constant currency revenue growth of 0. 8 percent to 3. 7 percent for TierI companies with crosscurrency impact of 2050 bps on reported USD revenue and of negative 0. 4 percent to positive 3. 4 percent for midcap firms with crosscurrency impact of 1030 bps on reported USD revenue. Investors should note that the flat revenue growth is coming at a high base. Meaning they will still be growing although at a slower pace. Deal wins Unexciting Deal wins which reached record highs earlier last year could be in line with historical trends in most cases said Padmanabhan but highlighted that these are deals that have been in the making since Q1FY23. From Q4FY23 lower deal flow could be seen as clients trim their spending. Kotak also said it expects steady but unexciting deal win numbers from IT companies. Many companies have announced a few interesting deals in the three months with TCS leading the pack. We believe TCS could report TCV total contract value of 910 billion. We expect 2. 5 billion of TCV from Infosys and HCL Tech said Saluja. TCV growth for the sector moderated in the last four quarters though that failed to impact growth since many deals were discretionary shortcycle programs. Stock talks The market has already reflected some of the lower projections on earnings. However lowlevel buying in some names has kept it afloat so far. In the last one year the Nifty IT index has delivered merely 2 percent returns. Among the biggest names Tata Consultancy Services TCS has seen a drawdown of 15 percent in the last year. In the same period Infosys is down 21 percent HCL Tech 22 percent and Wipro 46 percent. The risk for IT services stocks is continued revenue weakness in H2FY23 followed by a tepid start to FY24 said Padmanabhan. This could bring down TierI growth expectations to 67 percent vs 8 percent currently leading to a potential contraction in PE multiples. The selloff in some names have made them attractive. However all investors are not rushing to buy as they wait and watch the development. We expect investors to focus on growthdecline in IT budgets for CY2023 the state of demand and the pace of decision making. Infosys HCL Tech and Mphasis are our top picks said Saluja. Emkay said its pecking order is Wipro Infosys Tech Mahindra HCL Tech and TCS among TierI players and Zomato Mphasis Birlasoft Firstsource Solutions and Persistent Systems among midcaps.

25,The shift from war for talent to delayed onboarding: Looking back at Indian ITâs rollercoaster year,"In the 2022 calendar year, three out of four of the top IT firms have shown a declining trend in net employee additions.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/the-shift-from-war-for-talent-to-delayed-onboarding-looking-back-at-indian-its-rollercoaster-year-9786291.html,If the war on talent in IT dominated headlines in 2021 the winds began to shift in the opposite direction near the end of the previous fiscal year with companies adding fewer employees with each passing quarter. The pain was more visible in the September quarter when IT company employee additions fell 45 percent sequentially. In the 2022 calendar year or three quarters figures for the December quarter will be available in January three out of four of the top IT firms have shown a declining trend in net employee additions. Tata Consultancy Services Indias largest software exporter added 35209 employees on a net basis in the March quarter the companys highestever net addition in a quarter. This dropped by nearly 60 in the June quarter when it added 14136 new employees. This number fell to 9840 in the September quarter bringing the total for the calendar year to 59185. The companys highestever net addition at the start of the year doesnt mean attrition isnt a concern. While attrition is lower than that of competitors it has continued to rise. It was 17. 4 percent in the March quarter followed by 19. 7 percent and 21. 5 percent in the following quarters. Attrition was not the only factor. IT companies margins have also been squeezed with wage bills accounting for a sizable portion of expenses and employee costs rising. Also Read These sectors are hiring in 2023. See the list of skills in demand Following the companys results in Q2FY23 TCS Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan stated that it was not a shortterm margin lever but rather a strategic call to expand employee onboarding. We had hired close to 120000 freshers last year and invested into that pool given the longerterm visibility that we have on demand. We will tweak our employee model on an ongoing basis looking at the demand. So that is a reasonable expectation but our overall hiring model is predicated on much longer cycles rather than on shortterm quarteronquarter adjustments he said. Its competitor Infosys added 21948 employees in the March quarter and 21171 in the June quarter. However in the September quarter this was cut in half to 10032 people bringing the net addition for the year so far to 53151. Attrition at Infosys is also high but it started to decline in Q2FY22 falling from 28. 4 percent to 27. 1 percent sequentially. Infosys crosstown rival Wipro added 11457 employees in the first quarter of the calendar year increasing to 15446 in the June quarter but this fell sharply to 605 in the September quarter bringing the companys net addition for the year to 27508. Attrition has started to dip and was at 23 percent in Q2FY23. However the pain is apparent for Wipro which has delayed the onboarding of newly hired employees. While the company has stated that it will honour all offers made. HCLTech defied the trend with a net employee addition of 11000 in the March quarter which fell sharply to 2089 the following quarter and rose to 8359 in the September quarter bringing its total net addition over the three quarters of the 2022 calendar year to 21448. Attrition for the last two quarters has remained at 23. 8 percent. As the talent market has begun to cool companies are also looking at having a bottomheavy pyramid and utilising the talent theyve already hired. While the War on Talent was on inflated salaries added to woes of companies as they hired and replaced talent at a premium. According to ICRA wage cost inflation will likely begin to moderate by the end of the current fiscal year but margins will susceptible to any moderation in business performance due to macroeconomic headwinds. As net additions have declined so have IT job openings. Data from specialist staffing firm Xpheno in November revealed that IT job openings were on the decline for 7 months before seeing some uptick. Available jobs fell by more than 50 percent year on year in October. Although the number of available jobs increased in November it remained the second lowest in a 24month period. According to Xpheno data jobs in the IT sector used to account for more than 80 percent of available job openings but that figure is now less than 50 percent. While global big tech players and their counterparts continue to rock the boat with layoffs and hiring freeze Indian IT majors and cohorts arent entirely following suit. The marginal recovery and return of hiring action among the Indian Tech cohorts is a sign of returning to moderated preCovid levels of action. There could well be a window of opportunity opening up for the Indian IT Service sector when global marquees under margin pressures rework their plans to offshore jobs Xpheno cofounder Anil Ethanur said. According to data from job platform foundit released earlier this month there has been a revival in IT after months of decline indicating a positive sentiment in hiring.,"IT Sector Preview: EBIT margin to look up but lack of growth, flat deal wins to weigh",Somewhat Negative,220,"['weak', 'recessionary', 'negative', 'foreboding', 'stagnation', 'disappoints', 'lag', 'inflationary', 'negative', 'slower', 'risk', 'weakness', 'weak']",[],"[Nitin, Padmanabhan, Kawaljeet, Saluja, Saluja, Dipesh, Mehta, Mehta, Padmanabhan, Padmanabhan, Saluja]"
