The suit accuses Meta Google TikTok and Snap of creating a mental health crisis among Americas youth. Giant social media companies are accused of creating a mental health crisis among Americas youth in a lawsuit filed Friday by the Seattle public schools district. The suit which Insider has reviewed names Facebook Instagram TikTok YouTube Snapchat Google and their associated companies as defendants and slams their business models claiming they harm youths. Seattles public school system said it had a responsibility to file the suit because children suffering from mental health problems perform worse in school and are less likely to attend at all affecting the schools educational mission. The lawsuit alleges that the apps have successfully exploited the vulnerable brains of youth hooking tens of millions of students across the country into positive feedback loops of excessive use and abuse of Defendants social media platforms. It added that the content they curate and direct to youth is too often harmful and exploitive pointing to examples encouraging selfharm and an extreme corpse bride diet. Increasing rates of mental illnesses further intensified by the pandemic are alleged to be a consequence of this. According to the American Psychological Association the rate of 12 to 17yearolds experiencing major depression increased by 52 from 2005 to 2017. During the first seven months of COVID19 lockdowns the APA later reported mental healthrelated emergency department visits for the same age group increased by 31 compared to 2019. Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram was fined 403 million in September 2022 by Irish regulators for failing to protect childrens privacy. It was fined a further 414 million on January 4 amid a row over whether it needs to ask users for consent to track them for advertisers. The lawsuit also quotes President Joe Bidens State of the Union address last year in which he said We must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment theyre conducting on our children for profit. A Snap spokesperson said nothing is more important to us than the wellbeing of our community and it works closely with mental health organizations to give users resources to help them deal with the challenges facing young people today. Metas global head of safety Antigone Davis said its developed over 30 tools to support teens and families encouraging time limits and identify over 99 of harmful content before its reported.

5,Seattle schools sue tech giants over social media harm,"The public school district in Seattle is suing the tech giants behind TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat, seeking to hold them accountable for the mental health crisis among youth",https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/seattle-schools-sue-tech-giants-social-media-harm-96290958,SEATTLE The public school district in Seattle has filed a novel lawsuit against the tech giants behind TikTok Instagram Facebook YouTube and Snapchat seeking to hold them accountable for the mental health crisis among youth. Seattle Public Schools filed the lawsuit Friday in U. S. District Court. The 91page complaint says the social media companies have created a public nuisance by targeting their products to children. It blames them for worsening mental health and behavioral disorders including anxiety depression disordered eating and cyberbullying making it more difficult to educate students and forcing schools to take steps such as hiring additional mental health professionals developing lesson plans about the effects of social media and providing additional training to teachers. Defendants have successfully exploited the vulnerable brains of youth hooking tens of millions of students across the country into positive feedback loops of excessive use and abuse of Defendants social media platforms the complaint said. Worse the content Defendants curate and direct to youth is too often harmful and exploitive.... While federal law Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act helps protect online companies from liability arising from what thirdparty users post on their platforms the lawsuit argues that provision does not protect the tech giants behavior in this case. Plaintiff is not alleging Defendants are liable for what thirdparties have said on Defendants platforms but rather for Defendants own conduct the lawsuit said. Defendants affirmatively recommend and promote harmful content to youth such as proanorexia and eating disorder content. In emailed statements Sunday Google and Snap said they had worked to protect young people who use their platforms. Snap launched an inapp support system called Here For You in 2020 to help those who might be having a mental health or emotional crisis find expert resources and it also has enabled settings that allow parents to see whom their children contact on Snapchat though not the content of those messages. It also has recently expanded content about the new 988 suicide and crisis phone system in the U. S. We will continue working to make sure our platform is safe and to give Snapchatters dealing with mental health issues resources to help them deal with the challenges facing young people today the company said in a written statement. Jos Castaeda a spokesperson for Google said Google which owns YouTube had also given parents the ability to set reminders limit screen time and block certain types of content on their childrens devices. We have invested heavily in creating safe experiences for children across our platforms and have introduced strong protections and dedicated features to prioritize their well being Castaeda said. Meta and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit says that from 2009 to 2019 there was on average a 30 increase in the number of Seattle Public Schools students who reported feeling so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that they stopped doing some typical activities. The school district is asking the court to order the companies to stop creating the public nuisance to award damages and to pay for prevention education and treatment for excessive and problematic use of social media. While hundreds of families are pursuing lawsuits against the companies over harms they allege their children have suffered from social media its not clear if any other school districts have filed a complaint like Seattles. Internal studies revealed by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen in 2021 showed that the company knew that Instagram negatively affected teenagers by harming their body image and making eating disorders and thoughts of suicide worse. She alleged that the platform prioritized profits over safety and hid its own research from investors and the public.,How to use Quick Tap on Android 13,Extremely Positive,90,"['limit', 'envious', 'scratched', 'break', 'problem']",['itch'],[]
6,‘I went downhill’: man falsely accused of rape on becoming a hate figure,Jordan Trengove faced trial after being accused by Eleanor Williams after a night out in 2019When 18-year-old Jordan Trengove agreed to go on a night out with Eleanor Williams in 2019 he had no idea that accepting her invitation would not just land him in jai…,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/03/i-went-downhill-man-falsely-accused-of-on-becoming-a-hate-figure,When 18yearold Jordan Trengove agreed to go on a night out with Eleanor Williams in 2019 he had no idea that accepting her invitation would not just land him in jail but make him the enemy of a global antigrooming movement with its own line of merchandise. The teenagers and some friends went drinking in Barrow on 9 March 2019 and as far as Trengove can remember Williams disappeared halfway through the night. He didnt pay much attention because he was distracted by another girl Ebony that evening. Ebony ended up with him in the back of a police van after officers spotted him arguing at a taxi rank in the early hours. They said youre drunk lets take you home remembers Trengove. The duo were dropped off at a friends house and ended up having sex on the sofa according to Ebony when she was called to give evidence at Williamss trial more than three years later. Weeks passed and one day Trengove was asleep in bed when police arrived to arrest him on suspicion of raping drugging and assaulting Williams. He protested his innocence and cooperated with police handing over his phone and submitting to an intimate body check so that officers could look for signs of the violent struggle Williams had described. There was no bruising no markings says Trengove now. But the damage was done. The next day someone painted the word rapist on his house and smashed in the windows. Before he knew it he was in court being remanded in custody charged with three counts of rape. Williams had produced evidence that Trengove had admitted to the rapes goading her on Snapchat calling her a dirty slag who was well up for a shag that night. It took police all too long to realise that this Snapchat account had been created using the wifi at the Barrow home of Williamss mother. Prison was very very scary he said. I was put in cells with actual rapists and paedophiles. I shared with a man who admitted to me he was guilty of sending pictures to eightyearold kids. Trengove spent his 19th birthday in prison serving 10 weeks on remand before police realised the evidence against him didnt stack up. The girl Trengove actually had sex with on 9 March gave police a selfie she had taken in the back of the police van while suspicion grew that far from being a particularly unlucky victim of multiple rapes Eleanor Williams was in fact a fantasist making one false allegation after the other with the help of social media. Not only did she create fake profiles to frame Trengove and some of her other victims she started up explicit conversations with innocent men on Tinder Snapchat or the intimate photo sharing site OnlyFans where she had an account and renamed them in her phone so that it looked as though their penis photos and propositions were coming from those she falsely accused. Out of jail Trengove was a free man but an outcast in Barrow. I was barred from everywhere. I was called a rapist a nonce. Within a few months he moved away. I thought it would end but the first day we moved in I had someone shout rapist at me. It was clear then that no matter where I went someone would always know. Things calmed down and then on 20 May 2020 Williams posted the fatal Facebook page alleging that she had been trafficked and exploited by an Asian grooming gang. She didnt name Trengove but his name soon became linked with the case regardless of his skin colour as more than 100000 people joined the Justice For Ellie Facebook page and bought elephantthemed wristbands keyrings and bumper stickers to express solidarity. A rally was organised where convoys of cars drove from Barrow to the town where Trengove now lives flying Justice for Ellie banners. He tried to tell protesters the truth but no one would listen. I went downhill he said. I tried killing myself over it. I tried running away from it all. I tried ending my relationship walking away from my family. The amount of problems put on my life just from one Facebook post is ridiculous. Because Im autistic its even harder. I got diagnosed with complex PTSD because of it all. Ever since this went on I feel like Ive been trapped in my own little prison he added. I dont feel like I have a life any more. Trengove became a father in August 2021 but struggled to bond with his son as Williamss trial kept getting postponed. When I was in his newborn stage I couldnt love him like a dad should. I tried to distance myself away. My whole life just became sitting in playing video games. That was the way of escaping the reality of my life. Trengove now 22 was in court on Tuesday to hear the jury find Williams guilty of eight counts of perverting the course of justice including three involving him. Im over the moon he said afterwards pledging to go home and give his son a big hug.

7,Seattle public schools sue social media platforms for youth ‘mental health crisis’,"Lawsuit accuses companies behind TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube of harming young people’s mental healthSeattle’s public schools district has filed a lawsuit in the US against multiple major social media companies, accusing them of harming y…",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/08/seattle-public-schools-sue-social-media-platforms-youth-mental-health-crisis,Seattles public schools district has filed a lawsuit against multiple major social media companies accusing them of harming young peoples mental health. The lawsuit which was filed on Friday in US district court accused the social media companies behind TikTok Facebook Instagram Snapchat and YouTube of creating a mental health crisis among Americas youth. Defendants growth is a product of choices they made to design and operate their platforms in ways that exploit the psychology and neurophysiology of their users into spending more and more time on their platforms. These techniques are particularly effective and harmful to the youth audience the 91page suit said. Defendants have successfully exploited the vulnerable brains of youth hooking tens of millions of students across the country into positive feedback loops of excessive use and abuse of defendants social media platforms it added citing harmful content including extreme diet plans and encouragements of selfharm. The lawsuit went on to attribute the companies alleged misconduct to the rising rates of anxiety depression thoughts of selfharm and suicide ideation experienced among young people. According to the lawsuit from 2009 to 2019 there was on average a 30 increase in the number of students at Seattle public schools who reported feeling so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that they stopped doing some usual activities. As students experience various mental health issues including anxiety and depression their performance in schools drop the lawsuit said making them less likely to attend school and more likely to engage in substance use and to act out in turn hindering Seattle public schools ability to fulfill its educational mission. Under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act the federal law helps provide immunity for online platforms with respect to thirdparty users and what they choose to post as content. However the lawsuit claims that the provision does not protect the social media companies and says they are liable for recommending distributing and promoting content and marketing their social media platforms in a way that causes harm. In a statement to Axios Google spokesperson Jos Castaeda said Google has invested heavily in creating safe experiences for children across our platforms and have introduced strong protections and dedicated features to prioritize their well being citing Family Link as an example a parental control feature that allows parents to set screen time and restrict content among other abilities. Similarly Snapchat said that it is working closely with many mental health organizations to provide inapp tools and resources for users and that the wellbeing of its community is its top priority the company told Reuters. In October 2021 Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pushed back against allegations from lawmakers that claimed Facebook was making profits at the expense of young peoples mental health. The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical Zuckerberg said on Facebook which is owned by Meta. We make money from ads and advertisers consistently tell us they dont want their ads next to harmful or angry content. And I dont know any tech company that sets out to build products that make people angry or depressed he added. The Guardian has contacted Meta and TikTok for comment. According to the lawsuit the schools district is seeking damages as a result of the public nuisance which it has asked the court to order the companies to stop creating. The district is also seeking money to pay for prevention education and treatment for excessive and problematic use of social media.,‘I went downhill’: man falsely accused of rape on becoming a hate figure,Extremely Negative,1090,"['enemy', 'suspicion', 'raping', 'protested', 'violent', 'struggle', 'bruising', 'damage', 'Prison', 'scary', 'guilty', 'prison', 'suspicion', 'unlucky', 'false', 'allegation', 'fake', 'falsely', 'outcast', 'fatal', 'downhill', 'problems', 'ridiculous', 'trapped', 'prison', 'struggled', 'guilty']","['drunk', 'sex', 'rapist', 'rape', 'dirty', 'shag', 'sex', 'penis', 'rapist', 'rapist', 'killing']","[Trengove, Eleanor, Williams, Trengove, Williams, Ebony, Ebony, Trengove, Ebony, Williamss, Trengove, Williams, Williams, Trengove, 'harassment', Williams, Trengove, Barrow, Williamss, Trengove, Trengove, Eleanor, Williams, 'lawsuit', Trengove, Trengove, Williams, Trengove, Trengove, Trengove, Williamss, Trengove, Williams]"
8,"Thanks to Google and Apple's taxes, web apps on Windows PC are suddenly getting good","As services like Snapchat, TikTok, and Instagram struggle to find growth on mobile, they've started crawling back to Windows PC.",https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/thanks-to-google-and-apples-dev-tax-web-apps-on-windows-pc-are-suddenly-getting-good,Thanks to Google and Apples taxes web apps on Windows PC are suddenly getting good The web app revolution is coming to a desktop PC near you. Oh how the turn tables or something. Remember web apps We started writing about progressive web apps PWAs back in 2018 or even earlier describing how the webbased app alternatives could be an important tool for Microsoft to compete with Apple and Google in the mobile space. Sadly the proliferation of PWAs came too late to save Windows Phone but given the hostile environment towards Apple and Googles platforms suddenly major platforms are starting to take the technology a lot more seriously. The Instagram app was practically abandonware for years but now it suddenly allows uploads and even dark mode. Microsoft itself invested in the webbased video editing app Clipchamp. And notorious Windowshater Snapchat itself has even snuck into the Microsoft Store recently as yet another web app. Heres why this is awesome for PCs Windows laptops and Surface tablets and why a webfirst app model may offer the slimmest of prayers for a Windowsbased phone in a farflung future. PWAs on Windows PC are getting really good As someone who works fully remotely in media and publishing it always bugged me having to reach for my phone to do basic social media tasks. Sure Microsoft Phone Link exists and Instagram has long had a PWA in the Microsoft Store but it has been in various states of disrepair since its inclusion. Phone Link screen streaming is also monstrously irritating requiring constant approvals to access. Using Facebooks own codebase the original Instagram native app was a translated crossplatform affair that was just truly awful and barely compatible with UWP. The app was crashtacular lacked basic features like content uploading and when it eventually did get those additional features they barely worked. Its a blessing then that Facebook now Meta ditched their native app for a fully tooled progressive web app instead available through the Microsoft Store or Microsoft Edge by pinning Instagram. com as an app through the browser. We have a guide on how to pin websites as apps on Windows right here. Instagram for the Microsoft Store is by no means as fully featured as the Android or especially the iOS app. There are no inapp video editing tools for example. You also cant see business analytics or use most of the suites business tools in general. However it offers the basic and most necessary features you need to use the social network something that simply wasnt possible previously. You can upload preedited video clips and photos to your feed. It allows you to take advantage of more powerful Windowsbased editing software packages and upload directly without having to use an intermediary service which often costs money. I noticed yesterday that the web app also carries across my dark mode setting which is a nice touch. Instagram isnt the only bigname app hitting the Microsoft Store. We now also have services like TikTok available for example. The most popular social media app in the world right now TikTok joined Twitter and Pinterest as a dayone player when it comes to web app access to its platform. TikTok has been generally ahead of the curve when it comes to access and virality and longtime holdouts like Facebook Snapchat and Instagram have clearly noticed. Speaking of Snapchat the beleaguered social network was once fingered as causing the downfall of Windows Phone with its total ban on users accessing the platform from Lumia devices and threats to sue developers building thirdparty versions. But now the tables have well and truly turned. Snapchat itself has now build a Microsoft Store web app for its chat tools joining the likes of Facebook Messenger Telegram and WhatsApp with access via laptops and PCs. I doubt it will do much to move the needle on Snaps share price but hey schadenfreude. There are tons of highquality PWAs in the Microsoft Store these days. From longtime supporters like Polarr to newcomers like Clipchamp. The tools are often limited compared to native counterparts but it feels like the tech is improving every day with the logical conclusion being nearparity with native codebases. But why is this happening now Why is this happening A confluence of events is most likely to blame for this renewed interest in PWAs from major companies. The proliferation of new technology and improvements to Chromium as well as Microsofts adoption of it are doubtless part of the puzzle but I reckon were looking more at financial incentives than anything else here. Apple has quite notoriously wiped billions off Facebooks business model in the past couple of years. Apples sweeping and necessary privacy improvements offered users a very explicit choice on how companies in the Apple app store can access and leverage customer data to the detriment of Facebook and its associated businesses. On iOS users can very easily optout of Facebook and Instagram data collection while dark patterns often obfuscate the process on other platforms. As a result Facebooks ad business has taken a battering. For Facebook and other adreliant business models moving their operations to the web is an obvious bet. Microsoft last year announced that it would offer zero commission options for developers putting nongaming apps into the Microsoft Store last year. Whether via the Microsoft Store or not businesses purchasing ad boosters and other inapp purchases via the web dont have to pay that nasty 30 cut to Apple or Google Play a tax that has become increasingly controversial. Did you know Apple puts a secret 30 tax on everything you buy through their App Store httpst. coLGkPZ4EYczNovember 28 2022 Elon Musk recently lamented the Apple tax when he attempted to relaunch the Twitter Blue subscription service. Consequently Twitter Blue costs 30 extra if purchased via iOS to offset that cost. If you buy Twitter Blue via the web its a little cheaper. Theres no overhead on the web in that context although your potential reach on mobile devices particularly in the U. S. may be diminished. Spotifys CEO also renewed his attacks on Apples app store practices last month noting that Apple punishes competitors on its platform to the tune of 30 while also prioritizing and promoting its own competing services such as Apple Music. It seems that regulators are starting to agree given that Apple is about to be forced by the European Union to adopt Androidlike openness with app sideloading and thirdparty app stores. Of course the web and web apps bypass all this given that its open directtoconsumer medium. Netflix Xbox Game Pass and other subscription services generally opt for webonly subscription models to avoid paying Apples businessstifling tax. Another core reason behind all of this is the state of the global economy. The general battering of tech stocks over the past year has seen companies look anywhere everywhere for growth opportunities. In a world where Apple wants to gouge businesses for every penny fostering communities directly on the web seems increasingly lucrative. There were assumptions that smartphones would kill PC usage dead but those predictions simply havent materialized in reality. PWAs bridge the gap for Microsoft Some of us once hoped that PWAs could be an answer to Microsofts appgap problem on Windows Phone and even Surface. MacBooks and iPads are home to some truly excellent exclusive apps like Final Cut Pro iMovie and Procreate many of which are cited to me as reasons people opt for iStuff instead of Surface. While things have gotten better PWAs are still a far cry from native options for more advanced tools. Clipchamp has become a truly great alternative to iMovie but doesnt quite reach the usability features of native apps like Adobe Rush or even Android options like inShot. Ive yet to find a web app for inking thats as powerful as apps like Adobe Fresco or AutoDesk Sketchbook. Still in an economy thats squeezed the incentive for services to move towards open platforms is increasing. Many companies would be far more profitable if they didnt have to dish out 30 of their income to Apples shareholders. The financial impetus is there and the tech is very rapidly catching up.

9,Does Slack notify when you screenshot? What you need to know,Slack does not notify users if you take a screenshot within the app. Here's what that entails and how it compares to other apps.,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/does-slack-notify-screenshots,Slack does not notify users if you take a screenshot within the app. Users can capture conversations and user profiles without notifying the other person. Here are the details and how Slacks screenshot notification compares to other apps. If youre a frequent Slack user youve no doubt had occasion to preserve a conversation outside of the Slack app. Perhaps youve taken a screenshot of a message to share with someone else or to save for your own purposes. Either way youve probably wondered if like some social media and messaging apps Slack notifies the other party when you take a screenshot. Does Slack notify users about screenshots Not all social media and messaging apps handle screenshots the same but if youre concerned that someone was notified when you took a screenshot in Slack youre in for a relief. In a nutshell Slack does not notify anyone if you take a screenshot within the app. You can capture a group conversation a chat within a channel a direct message or even a users profile and photo there will be no notification or record that you did this whether you do it on the desktop or in a mobile app. That means you can capture a screenshot of anything in Slack and share it with people outside the app and no one else involved in the conversation will find out. On the other hand that of course means that other Slack users can do this to you without notification as well. How other apps notify users about screenshots Slack is far from the only messaging app which doesnt inform users about screenshots in fact this is pretty much the standard among messaging apps. Apps on the desktop generally have no way to know when a screenshot occurs and relatively few mobile apps can recognize when a screenshot occurs either. In particular Facebook Messenger doesnt notify users about screenshots for example nor do messaging apps like Google Chat Microsoft Teams or even the securityconscious Signal. In fact the only major messaging app that notifies users about screenshots is Snapchat though Telegram is able to notify the other party if you take a screenshot in certain situations like in a secret chat.,"Thanks to Google and Apple's taxes, web apps on Windows PC are suddenly getting good",Extremely Positive,470,"['Sadly', 'hostile', 'dark', 'notorious', 'monstrously', 'irritating', 'awful', 'lacked', 'dark', 'downfall', 'threats', 'sue', 'doubt', 'limited', 'blame', 'notoriously', 'detriment', 'dark', 'battering', 'controversial', 'attacks', 'battering', 'dead', 'problem', 'cry', 'breaking', 'problem']","['nasty', 'kill']","['lawsuit', Polarr, Clipchamp, 'lawsuit', Elon, Musk, 'harassment', Jez, Corden, Jez, JezCorden]"
10,"Snapchat Marketing: An In-Depth Guide via @sejournal, @BrianFr07823616","This guide to Snapchat marketing, is an overview of an often misunderstood channel for marketers and how to start using it effectively. 
The post Snapchat Marketing: An In-Depth Guide appeared first on Search Engine Journal.",https://www.searchenginejournal.com/snapchat/474251/,Social media marketing is all about location. If your target audience is on a platform then you should be too. And if youre going after a younger demographic that means Snapchat. Snapchat is the sixth largest social media network its also one of the most misunderstood by marketers. So if youre panicking right now about missing the boat on this platform youre not alone and youre not old you just need a quick primer. In this guide to Snapchat marketing we are going to give you an overview of this multimedia messaging platform explain whos using it and give you the information you need for adding it to your marketing strategy. What Is Snapchat And How Does It Work Snapchat is a smartphone appbased social media platform. Sometimes referred to as SC or simply Snap it was initially designed with a focus on private persontoperson sharing. It sought to create a natural interaction flow with shared images videos and messages that are only available for a limited amount of time up to 10 seconds after viewing after which they are automatically deleted. Over time the apps developers began adding more features. They still allow private multimedia messaging but this is now supplemented with features like live video chat chronological stories and Bitmoji avatars. Users can also apply filters and use AR lenses to add animations and effects. Okay you may be saying this sounds like a fun app but what can it do for me as a marketer And more importantly what can it do for my brand Why You Should Be Using Snapchat For Marketing Successful marketers take advantage of every opportunity to reach potential targets that present themselves and Snapchat offers a lot of opportunities. As of October 2022 it had more than 363 million active daily users more than 82 of whom are 34 or younger. The most active users are 13yearolds. That means if your brand is going after Millennials or Gen Z you need a presence on the app. It may not have the sheer user volume of Facebook or YouTube but according to Snapchats own data the average user snaps between 20 and 40 times and spends at least 30 minutes on the app per day. Those are engagement numbers other sites would kill for. And not only does Snapchat offer incredible user engagement but its also a territory that is largely untapped by marketers. There are marketers on the platform but unlike sites like Facebook and Twitter where commercial presence is ubiquitous many brands have not yet established a presence on Snapchat. This presents a great opportunity for you. Snapchat marketing also tends to feel more authentic. By showing followers whats happening right now rather than using a digitally modified airbrushed and perfectlooking piece of marketing collateral youre showing your business as it really is. People love that. By now it should be clear why you should add Snapchat to your marketing mix but now comes the hard part how do you do that Well get into that in just a bit but when you have time you should first check out our podcast on how to use Snapchat in your marketing campaigns. Now lets take a closer look at just how to use Snapchat. How Does Snapchat Work If your social media experience is primarily from using Facebook Instagram and Twitter you may find Snapchat a bit frustrating at first. For one thing its design is fairly unique. Actions are controlled by unlabeled icons and swiping right or left takes you to a different part of the app. And whereas other platforms are friendly to predeveloped content Snapchat isnt. Instead youll need to create videos or photos messages known as Snaps or Snapchat stories in the app in realtime. There is a bit of a learning curve but with a little patience youll soon master it and be snapping like a pro. How To Take A Snapchat Picture Or Video After youve created an account and opened the app for the first time youll be faced with an ordinary backfacing camera. Play around with this to discover the functionality it provides including turning the flash on and off reversing the camera and putting the camera into night mode. To take a picture simply press the circle button at the bottom. To take a video press and hold it. Next you can edit your Snap with text filters stickers and links to your homepage or a special offer page for example. Youll also be able to adjust how long the content will last for the viewer. Once youre ready to send the video or image you can select who receives it or if you want to add it to your Snapchat story but well cover that in the next section. Thats it Congratulations youve just made your first Snapchat post. Create A Snapchat Story Just like Facebook and Instagram stories Snapchat stories are collections of videos and images that disappear after 24 hours. They collect your Snaps chronologically which allows you to create a narrative around your brand. To make yours impactful use original i. e. not previously used Snaps to create a story arc. You can determine who sees these under Settings. By default they will only be viewable by your friends but as a brand you should change this to Everyone to improve your exposure and visibility. Outlining Your Snapchat Marketing Strategy If youre trying to make an impression and you are just slapping together a profile and uploading the occasional video isnt going to cut it. You need a wellthoughtout strategy that will speak to your audience in a way that resonates and generate real results. But before you can generate results you need to know what youre hoping to achieve and write out your plan to make it happen. First consider your goals. Do you want to use Snapchat to Build awareness Expand your customer base Reengage cold prospects or past customers Generate a buzz around a new product Once youve decided what you want to achieve from this platform its time to develop your strategy. Decide who you want to reach and what action you want them to take then decide what type of content will best help you achieve that. Dont be afraid to experiment. And be aware that some of your approaches are going to fail. But thats what separates successful marketers from mediocre ones Successful marketers are always learning from failures and applying that knowledge to help them get better results. What kind of content should you be creating Read on weve got you covered. Types Of Marketing Content For Snapchat Like other forms of social media SC is all about encouraging engagement. There are several types of posts you can employ to make this happen including Sneak peeks If you have a new product or offering people have been clamoring for Snapchat is a great way to build excitement. A simple image with Its here can hype up the people who have been looking forward to this release inspire shares and increase the conversation around your brand. Behindthescenes People love to see how the sausage is made. Snapchat lets you provide this in an authentic unpolished way. It helps your audience feel connected and in the know while making them part of the experience. Usergenerated content Increase your exposure by inviting your audience into your Snaps. Tie giveaways and contests into your plan and reward people who use your custom hashtag or mention your brand in their own snaps. Interactivity Create activities your followers can take part in like asking your audience to send you Snaps of them using your product or interacting with you in another way. For example you may ask them to fill in the blank in I use my your product name to. Let them know the best answers will be featured in your story andor receive a prize. Testimonials Have a superfan who really loves your business Ask them to film a short video explaining why and then share this with your audience. Coupons or QR codes Give your audience an incentive for checking out your snaps. Include a digital coupon or QR code that redirects to an exclusive offer page. Snapchat Advertising So far weve only talked about ways to use SC for organic marketing but the app also offers paid options for varying price ranges. If you have the marketing budget you can buy advertising that goes directly into an audiences feed or purchase ads in the Discover section. You can also sponsor a Lens as a way to create user engagement and help bring your brand to life. On the other hand if you dont have access to a big marketing budget you can use Snapchat OnDemand Geofilters which use custom artwork to promote your brand location offerings or event. Snapchat Advertising Examples Snapchat Marketing Best Practices Now that you know how Snapchat works how to post content and how to develop your strategy lets look at some of the best practices to help you maximize your impact Let people know youre on Snapchat If youre just getting into SC mention it and solicit follows on your other social channels. Optimize your profile Choose a username that suits your brand. And be sure to include a URL to your site. Keep it light People are on SC for entertainment which means your content should be fun and enjoyable. Showcase your brand andor products It should be immediately clear to anyone viewing your Snaps what youre selling. Interact with other users If you want engagement you have to engage with others. Seek out collaboration opportunities respond to Snaps and follow other Snapchatters. Dont be overly salesy Despite the last point you have to walk a thin line between being informational and hardselling. Snapchat is generally not a good platform for highpressure sales tactics. Post regularly Consistent posting is essential to building your following and expanding your exposure. Try something new Dont be afraid to take a risk and try something different. In the worstcase scenario its gone in 24 hours. Lets Get Snapping Snapchat is a fun and effective platform for marketing but many marketers are put off by its difference from other more comfortable social media sites. But their loss is your gain. Snapchatters have 4. 4 trillion in spending power and theyre largely from a generation that is not only comfortable with online shopping but prefers it. Hopefully this guide has encouraged you to make a start decide on your strategy and get snapping.

It's a big vote of confidence in the future of AI.",https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-10-billion-openai-gamble-2023-1,Microsofts reported 10 billion OpenAI bet is a gamble on the future of AI Happy Wednesday friends. This is Matt Weinberger deputy editor of Insiders tech analysis team writing to you from extremely rainy hopefully not flooded by the time you read this San Francisco. Were less than two weeks into 2023 and its already become clear that OpenAIs ChatGPT will be the defining technology of the year. The ability to ask a robot to write you anything from a cover letter to dating app responses has proven to be an addictive and enticing one sparking a new gold rush in the startup space. Microsoft clearly wants in on this in a big way The Redmondbased titan is said to be in talks to invest 10 billion in OpenAI at a 29 billion valuation. The two companies are already pretty cozy as Microsoft is said to plan to integrate OpenAIs technology into the Bing search engine and Office productivity suite. But this would take it to the next level Microsoft is reportedly asking for 75 of OpenAIs profits until it recoups the 10 billion. Thats some serious business in more ways than one. But it just goes to show you how much confidence Microsoft and others have in the future of AI. Heres what you need to know on this wintry Wednesday. If this was forwarded to you sign up here. Download Insiders app here. 1. Microsofts big bet on OpenAI is both totally wild and completely understandable. Microsoft is said to be prepping a 10 billion investment in OpenAI even as separate reports indicate that its bringing the ChatGPT AI chatbot and tech like it to products like Bing Office and Windows. The wouldbe deal really underscores just how quickly OpenAIs star has risen as ChatGPT hits the mainstream. Still that 29 billion valuation is rich for a company with limited revenue and the high costs of running advanced AI. It raises the question Is the AI boom just another bubble Consider also that even with all the hype ChatGPT aint perfect. Insiders Jordan Parker Erb used it to answer her Hinge matches and didnt get a single response. Artificial intelligence is great at pattern matching but perhaps less so at matchmaking. But if you wont find AI on the dating scene you might come across it in the courtroom sooner than you think.

This time it comes from Seattles public school district claiming that apps have had a major role in the youth mental health crisis. The district accuses social media platforms of causing a variety of mental health and behavioral issues in children and being exploitive and manipulative. According to the lawsuit all these platforms are deliberately manipulating and exploiting users targeting particularly the youngest ones among them. Defendants growth is a product of choices they made to design and operate their platforms in ways that exploit the psychology and neurophysiology of their users into spending more and more time on their platforms the lawsuit reads. It points out that these techniques have particularly affected and harmed the youth audience. According to the lawsuit these platforms have intentionally cultivated all of these techniques creating a mental health crisis among Americas youth. We can all agree that spending too much time on social media harms mental health. This is especially dangerous for children who arent fully developed in terms of selfawareness and critical thinking. After all even Meta itself admits that Instagram has a terrible effect on teenagers. This is bad on its own but the school district lawsuit points out another set of consequences related to children and their time at school. In the 202122 school year 96 percent of public schools reported offering at least one type of mental health service to their students the lawsuit reads. And as it appears more and more students are seeking them. However the need for these services is increasing as children suffer from more and more mental health and behavioral issues. As much as 88 percent of surveyed public schools did not strongly agree that they could effectively provide mental health services to all students in need. There arent enough mental health professionals to tackle these issues access to licensed mental health professionals is inadequate and there arent enough funds. Perhaps you remember that this isnt the first time social media were accused of affecting a teenagers suicide. In 2022 two women sued Instagram and Snapchat over their childrens suicides. Snapchat Google and Apple were also sued for failing to protect kids from online predators. But to my knowledge this is the first time that the entire school district has filed a lawsuit this big. Overusing social media causes major issues in children and it has further implications for their behavior learning selfesteem And ultimately it affects their loved ones and the entire school system these children are a part of.,Microsoft's reported $10 billion OpenAI bet is a gamble on the future of AI,Extremely Positive,140,"['limited', 'hype', 'Stern', 'Stern', 'break', 'blame', 'culprit', 'sneaky', 'sneaky', 'falls']",['fight'],"[Matt, Weinberger, Jordan, Parker, Erb, Peter, Stern, Stern, April, Joyner, Marc, Benioff, Tim, Levin, Matt, Weinberger, Hallam, Bullock, hallambullock, Jack, Ma]"
13,Woman who lied about grooming gang guilty of perverting course of justice,"Eleanor Williams, 22, claimed she had been trafficked by Asian gang and made false rape allegationsA 22-year-old woman from Barrow-in-Furness has been found guilty of perverting the course of justice by lying about being trafficked by an Asian grooming gang a…",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/03/eleanor-williams-lied-grooming-gang-guilty-perverting-justice,A 22yearold woman from BarrowinFurness has been found guilty of perverting the course of justice by telling malevolent lies about being trafficked by an Asian grooming gang and making false rape allegations against a series of white men. Eleanor Williams known as Ellie sparked a worldwide solidarity movement when she posted graphic photos of herself on Facebook alleging she had been beaten and raped by men who took her to sex parties around the northwest of England. The post made during the first Covid lockdown on 20 May 2020 prompted more than 100000 people to join a Facebook group called Justice for Ellie. It led to a line of merchandise featuring a purple elephant her favourite animal and prompted a crowdfunder which saw more than 1000 people donate 22000 to help her and bring her abusers to justice. It set off a chain of events that included a farright group gaining a foothold in Barrow and drove a sharp rise in racism and Islamophobia. Curry house windows were smashed beloved restaurants were boycotted and one Muslim takeaway owner was chased down the street by men who poured alcohol over his head. A local reporter who covered the case had to leave Cumbria on police advice after receiving numerous death threats. It also ruined the lives of those she falsely accused who were spat at ostracised and called paedo in the street. What Williams failed to mention in her viral Facebook post was that she had already been charged with making false rape allegations against four men. One of them an 18yearold man who had gone on a night out with her and friends spent 10 weeks in prison on remand before police checked his alibi. All too late they realised they had picked him up in Barrow town centre on the very night she first accused him of drugging and raping her having spotted him arguing in the street. The jury was shown a photograph of Jordan Trengove in the back of a police van with another girl at the exact time he was supposed to have raped Williams. She made two further claims against Trengove including false allegations that he had raped her at knifepoint manipulating social media posts to make it look as though he was sending her Snapchat messages boasting about the rapes. It took Cumbria police some time to discover the Snapchat account had been created using the internet connection at the house of Williamss mother a local Labour councillor Allison Johnston and that Williams had multiple phones she used to create a fictional web of abusers as well as fellow victims she created to corroborate her lies. The charges were dropped but Trengove had been found guilty in the court of public opinion and someone painted the word rapist on the side of his house. Now 22 Trengove says he suffers from depression and posttraumatic stress disorder as a result of his imprisonment and that he would have killed himself had he not become a father in August 2021. She has ruined my life said Trengove. I used to be a happy person. I was always going on nights out with my friends I was never in the house before this. Now I spend every day at home. Ever since this went on I feel like Ive been trapped in my own little prison. I dont feel like I have a life any more. Mohammed Ramzan a local businessman known as Mo Rammy received more than 500 death threats after Williams accused him of being the ringleader of the grooming gang. She alleged he had taken her to Amsterdam where he sold her at a brothel to the highest bidder as well as to Ibiza where she and other girls were pimped out to groups of men. Again Williams manipulated social media messages in order to frame Ramzan. But it did not take police too long to realise Ramzan had alibis for everything. When he was supposed to be auctioning her off in Amsterdam he was in Barrow BQ. His passport record showed he had never been to Ibiza. Other innocent men were framed as traffickers a random stranger she had a brief encounter with in a back alley in Preston a boy from Barrow whose home she had been drinking in. Others found themselves drawn into her web of deceit when she started chatting to them online and then changed their names in her phone to make them look like Asian abusers. The prosecution accused her of confecting the Asian grooming gang after watching the BBC drama Three Girls which told the true story of girls who were sexually exploited in Rochdale. They said she took the Amsterdam auction plot from the 2008 film Taken in which Liam Neeson plays a father searching for the sex traffickers who abducted his daughter. Much of the initial public sympathy came because of the photographs Williams posted purporting to show her injuries black eyes swollen lips bruises and slash marks all over her body and a little finger almost severed at the tip. But a forensic pathologist who examined the photos concluded that the injuries were selfinflicted probably with a claw hammer police found covered in Williamss blood but absent of anyone elses DNA. The jury was told that a few days before making the Facebook post Williams had bought a claw hammer from Tesco. Simon Fell the MP for Barrow and Furness said the case had caused huge community tensions in Barrow with an increase in racist attacks on Asian people and unofficial surveillance operations being carried out on Asian businesses. We saw a couple of plate glass windows put in in curry houses he said. I had doctors who worked at the local hospital come to me who were really concerned about their safety and their kids safety. I know one gentleman who ran a curry house his wife left him and took his children away because accusations were made against him. This really affected people genuine people whod been in the community for years and years and years. He said Williamss false claims provided fuel for a farright group Patriotic Alternative to start campaigning in the Cumbrian town. A jury of six men and six women took just threeandahalf hours to find Williams unanimously guilty of eight counts of perverting the course of justice. Wendy Lloyd senior crown prosecutor with the northwest rape and serious sexual offence unit said The impact on those falsely accused has been devastating and this conviction now fully exonerates the men who she accused of serious sexual abuse. Each of Eleanor Williamss accusations were thoroughly investigated until it became clear that they were completely and incontrovertibly untrue and made with malevolent intent. False accusations of this kind are very rare. This has been an unusual case and it is important for victims of rape or sexual assault to understand that they should never fear coming forward to report the crime to police. Williams will be sentenced on 13 and 14 March.,"Seattle schools sue TikTok, Meta, Snapchat, and YouTube over students’ mental health and behavioral issues",Extremely Negative,650,"['issues', 'crisis', 'accuses', 'issues', 'exploit', 'harmed', 'crisis', 'harms', 'dangerous', 'critical', 'terrible', 'bad', 'suffer', 'issues', 'issues', 'inadequate', 'sued', 'sued', 'failing', 'issues']",['suicide'],"['lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit']"
14,Sensual ASMR has boomed on YouTube — but creators are facing a crackdown,"Sensual ASMR, a subgenre of the popular ASMR video and audio genre, is an established niche on YouTube. But the platform has cracked down on creators.",https://www.theverge.com/23512732/sensual-asmr-youtube-creators-demonetization,Dev Ritchie vividly remembers the first time she experienced ASMR a feeling of wellbeing combined with a tingling sensation in the scalp and down the back of the neck often experienced in response to sound. She was sitting in a cafe with a friend who had told Ritchie she wanted to show her something. Ritchie allowed her companion to place a headphone earbud in each of her ears closed her eyes and listened to the barbershopbased ASMR video her friend had discovered. Her whole body tingled. Instantly she was hooked. She wasnt alone. According to ASMR University there are roughly 500000 ASMR an abbreviation of autonomous sensory meridian response channels and 25 million ASMR videos on YouTube alone and the hashtag asmr has attracted more than 460 billion views on TikTok. Creators in the space create soundbased content designed to elicit the sensation of ASMR in viewers often attracting millions of views in the process. The niche involves the recording of specific sounds often things like tapping or clicking in striking detail through the use of microphones. The ASMR niche has given way to a wide range of vloggers who cater to specific themes like electronic restoration and even barbershop experiences. Ritchie who now creates her own ASMR content occupies one of its most controversial subgenres a genre whose creators dub it sensual ASMR. Videos in the niche often involve the sounds of sexually charged licking kissing and wet massages all amplified by the use of microphones. Sensual ASMRs popularity pales in comparison to traditional ASMR Ritchies most viewed video HOT Step sister gives you HJ ASMR has 1. 5 million views while the most viewed ASMR video on YouTube has 407 million. But its appeal is undeniable. Ritchie alone has attracted more than 70000 subscribers under the name GanjaGoddess by releasing clips with titles like Boob Massage ASMR HOT Teacher PUNISHES You ASMR and Moaning and Dirty Talk ASMR. ASMR videos with audio sexual sounds may be agerestricted or removed from the platform. Clearly there is an audience for the content that Ritchie creates but YouTube doesnt see the appeal in her line of work. A year ago Ritchie received a message that explained her videos had been demonetized due to their sexual nature. Since then the platform has redoubled its efforts to combat the spread of sensual ASMR. In its September 7th policy change announcement YouTube stated that it had strengthened our policies to better identify and action ASMR content that is sexually gratifying adding that ASMR videos with audio sexual sounds may be agerestricted or removed from the platform. Ritchie like many other creators in her niche is worried her videos could all be deleted. Sensual ASMR videos have an undeniable raunchy component but raunchiness is also a spectrum purging anything that might be sexually titillating from YouTube would mean removing all kinds of scenes from mainstream films or television. And many creators argue that they arent purely about sex. Former modelturnedASMR vlogger Elcee Orlova feels that the mantras she utters in her videos which are usually proclamations of love care and affection aimed at those watching her clips are what keep people coming back for more. I get comments like Thank you for your video. No one has ever told me those things in my entire life and Watching your videos makes me feel a bit less lonely recounts Orlova who declined to share her age and location with The Verge for privacy reasons. She has attracted more than 40000 subscribers on her YouTube channel ASMR GIRLFRIEND where she uploads videos with titles like ASMR Girlfriend Gives You A VERY WET Massage and ASMR Girlfriend Measures You and Finds Out Your Size. I believe my videos can help those people feel cared for she adds and appreciated for who they are. Ritchie has similar feelings about her work. Theres a lot of people out there whether they want to admit it or not that are having a lot of issues with loneliness. I call myself their egirlfriend she says. I take the time to talk to them I tell them things and I care about them. Thats going to make them feel better. Theres a lot of people out there... that are having a lot of issues with loneliness. In the eyes of ASMR creators the content they offer up isnt inherently sexually explicit or in violation of YouTubes policies. Its all built around the power of suggestion and is often used to entice prospective clients who might want to view their more Xrated work. Most of the traction that I get through YouTube I use to just funnel into OnlyFans. Its like a billboard that I kind of get paid for. Like Now that you see what my tongue can do come watch me do other things with it explains Kaitlyn Siragusa a 28yearold sensual ASMR content creator and streamer from Texas who has amassed more than 8 million Twitch and YouTube followers under the name Amouranth. I dont know any girls who only do sensual ASMR she adds. Theyre always doing harder stuff on the side. The reluctance of ASMR creators to explicitly label their content as sexual is understandable in the context of YouTubes policies. The platform does not allow sexual content if its primary purpose is sexual gratification nor any content that involves the depiction of sexual acts or fetishes that are meant for sexual gratification. Its policies also clearly state that links to websites that violate those guidelines like sexually explicit OnlyFans pages for example are not allowed. It doesnt help that ASMR has often been classed as a fetish although creators in all of its niches vehemently deny that this is the case. Admitting that their ASMR content is designed to be sexually gratifying or used to promote Xrated content could mean that creators risk their videos being banned or their accounts being deleted. How YouTubes rules should apply to sensual ASMR is up for debate and YouTube didnt return a request for comment on the policy before publication. Creators in this space rely on the art of suggestion. Their videos are not visually sexually explicit and the reality of whats occurring whether it be the licking of an earshaped microphone or the squelching of offscreen macaroni is not necessarily sexually gratifying. YouTubes enforcement of such policies is also blurry. Clips of someone called Fetish Pixie spitting in front of a mirror as well as spitting compilations of TikTokers are available on the platform as well as videos that feature women sucking on each others toes or women being tickled while tied up BDSMstyle. Like sensual ASMR none of it depicts sex but its widely recognized as sexually charged. Not everyone feels that YouTubes regulations are a bad thing. To be honest with you I actually support YouTubes decision regarding ASMR videos that exist solely for sexual arousal like kissing and licking the microphone says Orlova. If someone wants to enjoy that kind of content they can easily switch from YouTube to some other sexrelated platform and watch the videos there. Others blame an increasingly competitive social media ads market which has come to a grinding halt this year after years of growth. I think a lot of its a rat race now. Theres so many places people can advertise Facebook Twitch Snapchat YouTube says Siragusa. The advertising market is getting so saturated now from all these different platforms. I think its a race to the bottom for who can be the most advertiserfriendly platform that people go to. But Ritchie thinks that the popularity of ASMR has made it an easy scapegoat for YouTube which is frequently under pressure to purge the site of nonfamilyfriendly videos. The space for nudity and sexual content online is shrinking. Dr. Carolina Are an innovation fellow at Northumbria Universitys Center for Digital Citizens and expert in online moderation and the censorship of nudity points to the influence of FOSTASESTA a US act designed to curb online sex trafficking making the hosting of sexual content riskier. The space for nudity and sexual content online is shrinking and this is massively worrying not just for sexual expression but also education she explains. Overthetop policies from social media giants have already left safesex educators struggling to disseminate information and has even led to the development of algospeak due to the censorship of words like lesbian and BDSM which entrenches the idea that sexuality and fetish are taboo things best left undiscussed. It feels like an incredibly patronizing puritan move Are continues. Like platforms are trying to regulate peoples lives and choices. Are also warns that YouTube may not make the distinctions Orlova does between sensual and nonsensual ASMR. Its going to bleed onto creators that make nonsexual content anyway because this is what happens with these specific policies she says. FOSTASESTA for example has already led to the inadvertent silencing of queer adult comic artists. This is very worrying because it means platforms can decide which type of content becomes obsolete or wrong at the flick of a switch. Companies it seems are mostly at that point. Most social media platforms practice stringent policies around sexual content Instagrams famed opposition to the female nipple in all of its forms Tumblrs porn ban and OnlyFans almostdecision to remove sexual content creators from its platform are just three examples of social medias sexual sanitation era and toeing the line between suggestive and unacceptable content becomes harder every month. Its left creators feeling frustrated. I just feel like people should be able to enjoy what they want to enjoy says Siragusa.

15,"Social media use may impact adolescents’ brain development, study says",A study published by neuroscientists at the University of North Carolina found adolescents who frequently checked social media showed increasing sensitivity to feedback from peers.,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/social-media-use-may-impact-young-adolescents-brain-development-study,Social media use may impact adolescents brain development study says North Carolina middle school students participated in the study New research presented by neuroscientists at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found young adolescents who habitually checked social media showed a distinct neurodevelopmental trajectory within the brain. Their sensitivity toward social rewards and punishments from peers heightened over time in comparison with those who engaged in moderate or low checking behaviors. The threeyear study of 169 sixth and seventhgrade students from three public middle schools in rural North Carolina was published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. The authors used functional magnetic resonance imaging MRI from recruits who were between the ages of 12 and 15. HOW TO AVOID BEING DUPED BY ROBOCALLS NOW AND FOREVER The participants reported the frequency at which they checked Facebook Instagram and Snapchat just once at the beginning of the study and were split into groups according to how often they checked those feeds. Their answers ranged from less than once to more than 20 times a day. Subjects received full brain scans as they played a computerized game that delivered rewards and punishment in the form of smiling or scowling peers. At around the age of 12 during what the authors pointed out was a critical developmental period habitual users already showed lower sensitivity to social anticipation. The results of this cohort study suggest that social media checking behaviors in early adolescence may be associated with changes in the brains sensitivity to social rewards and punishments. Further research examining longterm associations between social media use adolescent neural development and psychological adjustment is needed to understand the effects of a ubiquitous influence on development for todays adolescents the study said. However there were some limitations to the study. Since differences in neural trajectories already existed between participants with habitual and nonhabitual checking behaviors at the start of the study it was difficult to determine whether social media use prior to data collection caused these distinct neural trajectories or if preexisting differences in neural activation placed some youth at risk for more habitual checking behaviors. GOOGLE CHROMES INCOGNITO MODE MIGHT NOT KEEP YOU SO HIDDEN We cant make causal claims that social media is changing the brain Eva Telzer an associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and one of the authors of the study told The New York Times. However she explained that teens who are habitually checking their social media are showing these pretty dramatic changes in the way their brains are responding which could potentially have longterm consequences well into adulthood sort of setting the stage for brain development over time. That includes hypersensitivity to feedback from peers. The Times notes that the findings do not capture the magnitude of the brain changes just their trajectory and that authors said it remains unclear whether the changes are beneficial or harmful.

16,Seattle schools blame social media for a mental health crisis. Are tech companies liable?,"Seattle Public Schools says that Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, and YouTube are to blame",https://qz.com/seattle-schools-blame-social-media-for-a-mental-health-1849978157,Seattles public school system is unhappy. The district tasked with teaching approximately 50000 students across 100 schools is confronting what it calls a mental health crisis. And it has placed blame for this crisis on four social media companies Meta the parent company of Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp ByteDance the parent company of TikTok Alphabet the parent company of YouTube and Snap the company behind Snapchat. So the school district filed a lawsuit pdf against the four firms which are among the most valuable companies in the world with a combined market capitalization of about 2 trillion for wreaking havoc on its student population. From 2009 to 2019 there was an onaverage 30 percent increase in the number of students at plaintiffs schools who reported feeling so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that they stopped doing some usual activities lawyers for the school district wrote in a 92page complaint filed in the federal district court in Seattle on Jan. 6. Seattle Public Schools allege that the defendants violated Washington States public nuisance law a vague statute more commonly used for noise complaints than corporate malfeasance. The lawsuit is a headscratcher. Its built on a weak causality legal experts told Quartz between the actions of social media companies and the degraded mental health of its students and based on a claim of harm that would be better brought by affected students or parents rather than a school district. The suit also makes a legal argument about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act an important but controversial statue that gives websites some legal liability protection for usergenerated content. But that argument could soon be made irrelevant by the US Supreme Court which is tackling the question of Section 230 in its current term. The Seattle school districts argument Seattle Public Schools says design and algorithms that power the named social media companies are responsible for the suffering of its students. There are wellestablished repercussions for using social media. Last year a Wall Street Journal investigation spurred by a whistleblower found that Metas own internal research for example showed Instagram negatively affected teenage girls body image. But in a legal context experts say its difficult to isolate the cause of mental health problems in individual children let alone the collective thousands who attend a major metropolitan school district. And of course social media might harm some students while helping others find community and friends online. Theres no doubt that teens are under extraordinary psychological pressure perhaps unprecedented pressure but theres so many reasons why that might be the case said Eric Goldman a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law who stressed the drastic effects of the pandemic. Its hard to isolate whats causing the stress among Gen Z... because its all interrelated. Jennifer Granick an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union said in an interview that she was unsure how the school district can prove harm to its entire student body justify that its the right plaintiff and isolate the causes of the mental health crisis to social media. How are they going to show causation that that crisis is due to social media and not due to any one of the millions of other causes like stress and poverty and the pandemic she asked. Goldman also took issue with the school district bringing the case. I am puzzled by the idea that the school district is the right plaintiff he said. Think about all of the things going on in society that are manifesting in the school environment. Can school districts sue for all of those other problems Social media is the latest in a long list of bogeymen parents and officials have blamed over the years for corrupting the countrys youth Its a list that has included things like heavy metal video games and marijuana. Can the school districts sue the record labels that publish heavy metal or the game publishers who publish video games or the pot dealers who sell pot Goldman asked. Where does that start and stop It just makes no sense. The lawsuit only seeks one charge A violation of the states public nuisance law. But Goldman said that public nuisance laws typically apply to physical spaces not digital ones. Its an unusual claim he said. If theres a drug dealer setting up shop across the street that would be the kind of thing that might be a public nuisance. Calling software thats not connected to the school in any way a public nuisance is just weird. A spokesperson for Seattle Public Schools did not respond to a request for comment. The battle over Section 230 The most salient legal claim in the lawsuit is that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act does not protect the four defendants from legal liability for the design decisions that control their respective algorithms. Section 230 has become a lightning rod for social media criticism in recent years. The statute passed into law in 1996 essentially shields the owners of websites that host thirdparty content from userssuch as web forums comment sections and social mediafrom certain liability. Scholars widely credit Section 230 as intrinsic to the growth and maturation of the modern web Its given website owners breathing room to exercise their legal right protected by the First Amendment to moderate content as they see fit. And its propped up Silicon Valleys largest companies who depend on usergenerated posts photos videos comments reviews recommendations and much more to grow. But techs critics have searched far and wide for a way to rein in social media companies that they feel have grown too powerful and are abusing that power. American politicians as ideologically varied as Republican senator Josh Hawley and Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar have introduced bills to amend Section 230. This week president Joe Biden wrote in the Wall Street Journal that Congress must fundamentally reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act which protects tech companies from legal responsibility for content posted on their sites. A Supreme Court date for Section 230 In its lawsuit Seattle Public Schools claims that Meta Alphabet Snap and ByteDance cannot hide behind Section 230 for what their algorithms have chosen to promote effectively asking a federal court to weigh in on liability for recommending and promoting harmful content to youth as the complaint puts it. That question is worth asking but theres one caveatits already an issue before the Supreme Court. In a troubling sign for the law justice Clarence Thomas has previously signaled that he thinks Section 230 needs to be reevaluated. Two cases related to Section 230 Gonzalez v. Google and Twitter v. Taamnehhave put 230s protections frontandcenter before the Courts justices this term. The two cases largely assess whether Section 230 protects Googleowned YouTube as well as Twitter from legal liability Granick said that while algorithms can be controversial they are inseparable from how social media companies exercise their legal right to moderate content. An algorithm is just an automated way of putting policies in place she said. Thats how they take down hate speech. Thats how they take down misinformation. Thats how they take down harassment.,"Social media use may impact adolescents’ brain development, study says",Generally Neutral,70,"['split', 'critical', 'limitations', 'difficult', 'risk', 'unclear', 'harmful', 'bad']",[],"[Eva, Telzer, Telzer]"
17,Seattle Public Schools Sue Meta and TikTok for Youth ‘Mental Health Crisis’,"The public school district in Seattle has filed a lawsuit against the companies behind TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Snapchat, accusing them of harming young people’s mental health.
[Read More]",https://petapixel.com/2023/01/09/seattle-public-schools-sue-meta-and-tiktok-for-youth-mental-health-crisis/,Seattle Public Schools Sue Meta and TikTok for Youth Mental Health Crisis The public school district in Seattle has filed a lawsuit against the companies behind TikTok Instagram Facebook YouTube and Snapchat accusing them of harming young peoples mental health. Seattle Public Schools filed the lawsuit in U. S. District Court on Friday. It alleges that these social media companies have created a public nuisance by targeting their products to children. Seattle Public Schools claim the tech giants are responsible for creating a mental health crisis among Americas youth and have directly affected the schools ability to carry out their educational mission. Exploiting Vulnerable Youth According to AP News the lawsuit blames the social media companies for worsening mental health and behavioral disorders including anxiety depression disordered eating and cyberbullying. This has made it more difficult to educate students. The complaint also alleges that schools have been forced to take steps such as hiring additional mental health professionals developing lesson plans about the effects of social media and providing additional training to teachers. Defendants have successfully exploited the vulnerable brains of youth hooking tens of millions of students across the country into positive feedback loops of excessive use and abuse of Defendants social media platforms the complaint says. Worse the content Defendants curate and direct to youth is too often harmful and exploitive. Under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act federal law helps provide immunity for online platforms with respect to thirdparty users and what they choose to post as content. However the lawsuit argues that this provision does not protect the tech giants behavior in this case. Plaintiff is not alleging Defendants are liable for what thirdparties have said on Defendants platforms but rather for Defendants own conduct the lawsuit says. Defendants affirmatively recommend and promote harmful content to youth such as proanorexia and eating disorder content. The lawsuit went on to attribute the companies alleged misconduct to the rising rates of anxiety depression thoughts of selfharm and suicide ideation experienced among young people. According to the lawsuit from 2009 to 2019 there was on average a 30 percent increase in the number of students at Seattle public schools who reported feeling so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that they stopped doing some usual activities. Seattle Public Schools is seeking the maximum statutory and civil penalties permitted by law making the case that the social media companies have violated Washington states public nuisance law. Multiple families have pursued similar lawsuits against Meta the parent company of Instagram and Facebook contending that its social media platforms deliberately adjust its algorithms to hook young people. However Seattle Public Schools appears to be the first school district in the U. S. to file such a case against the companies.

Theres something about the constraints of mostly photo and video sharing that just feels healthier. Instagram is also an twelveyearold iPhone app it launched the same year as the iPad. As 2023 rolls in the refusal to make an iPad version that isnt just the web remains a head scratcher. Instagram made iPad apps It makes so much sense. Instagram is fantastic for sharing our favorite photos and videos and iPads are wonderful for appreciating both. Instagram Stories are even delightful despite being ripped off from Snapchat. And IGTV was a dud but a tablet version would have been neat if it wasnt Facebook and Instagram know the iPad exists. Facebook does a semiokay job or supporting Facebook and Messenger on the iPad and Instagram even made two iPad camera apps Hyperlapse and Boomerang just not you know the main app. Instagrams Layout app is also really nice. I see a lot of people use free adsupported alternatives with watermarks over the collage. Switch to Layout even if you dont want to post to Instagram. Instagram killed iPad apps The lack of a dedicated Instagram for iPad app used to be an opportunity for developers. Good times Instagram API good times Retro for Instagram was a great solution for example but Instagram changed its API that gave developers access to the service in their apps. Instagram killed the market for iPad app alternatives without making its own. Web apps arent apps One argument is that the progressive web app on Instagrams website is good enough if you save it to your Home screen. Its okay but native apps can simply do more. You can also run the iPhone version in a comically letterboxed window or scale it up at the cost of resolution fidelity but theres no landscape support and many iPads are attached to keyboards now. Update iPadOS 15 makes Instagram and other iPhoneonly apps a little less frustrating This but as a real app would be better than what we have now Theres a better way Another argument against Instagram for iPad is that its a legacy technology problem the quality of photos may be too low to properly present on a tablet display. I dont know that might be a legacy argument now. So much time has passed If so thats a problem that could easily be designed around Instagram could ship a grid of photos and even mix ads in between Bigger screen more ads Thats my best pitch to Instagram. This awesome concept by Parker Ortolani is another excellent example of how Instagram could adapt its iPhone app for the iPad without losing visual fidelity on the big screen. I would love to sit and browse photos and videos on Instagram for iPad in a dense layout with native resolution like that. I dont think theres any hope for the Gotham filter returning but Im optimistic that Instagram for iPad has to be around the corner. Now that video and messaging and Stories and group video calling and walkietalkie and hundreds of other features are now available thanks to Instagrams decision to aggressively compete with Snapchat Instagram for iPad has to be next on the list right Maybe Hopefully Things Instagram has done last year instead of making an iPad app Instagram rolls back TikTok design and limits suggested content doesnt credit the Kardashians Meta announces updates on NFT and other new features coming to Instagram and Facebook Instagram Web gets new more modern interface and yet no iPad app More ads are coming to Instagram including your profile feed Mark Zuckerberg says your Instagram feed is about to get even worse Instagram announces Subscriptions feature to increase creators revenue No your account isnt banned Instagram confirms ongoing outage Instagram has a few ideas for how to make you love the algorithm Instagram reverts recent change no longer plays Stories sound by default Facebook and Instagram boosts now have to give Apple a cut Meta calls it a tax Instagram users can now crosspost Reels to Facebook Instagram discontinues its standalone Boomerang and Hyperlapse apps In a callback to AIM Away Messages Instagram introduces new Notes feature Instagram rolling out new map experience to help users discover more places Meta threatens to pull Instagram and Facebook in Europe over privacy laws regulators say please do And I bet they havent even started working on the Apple mixed reality headset version of Instagram Check out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news,No Headline,Extremely Negative,810,"['Sue', 'Crisis', 'accusing', 'nuisance', 'crisis', 'Vulnerable', 'worsening', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'disordered', 'difficult', 'complaint', 'vulnerable', 'excessive', 'complaint', 'Worse', 'harmful', 'liable', 'harmful', 'disorder', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'sad', 'hopeless', 'nuisance']","['abuse', 'suicide']","['lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit']"
19,3 reasons why Seattle schools are suing Big Tech over a youth mental health crisis,"Seattle Public Schools is suing Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat for exacerbating the mental health crisis among its students.",https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/60788/3-reasons-why-seattle-schools-are-suing-big-tech-over-a-youth-mental-health-crisis,The public school district alleges that students are being recommended harmful content online exacerbating a mental health crisis and social media companies are allowing it to happen. Heres what you need to know about the lawsuit. The school system accuses social media platforms of increasing students anxiety and depression Seattle Public Schools alleges that the very design of these platforms which seek to maximize the amount of time users spend on them is flawed and dangerousparticularly to kids. They argue that the longer people stay on social media the more ads those companies sell and thus the more money they stand to make. And some features such as push notifications are designed to draw users in making it hard to ignore especially for kids the school district alleges. It also references studies that suggest teens who spend a lot of time using screens are more likely to receive diagnoses of depression or anxiety encounter cyber bullying and not get enough sleep. According to the lawsuit social media companies have exploited the vulnerable brains of youth hooking tens of millions of students across the country into positive feedback loops of excessive use and abuse. The lawsuit cites a 2021 investigation by the Wall Street Journal in which several teenage girls reported developing eating disorders or relapsing after TikTok promoted extreme diet videos to them. The issue of potentially dangerous content on social media is not a new one. As NPR reported in 2021 Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen a former product manager testified before Congress saying that executives hid research about the risks the companys products posed to kids. Since then Meta Facebook and Instagrams parent company has ramped up safety features for teens including efforts to prevent unwanted contact from adults tools that let parents limit the amount of time their children spend on Instagram and ageverification technology. We want teens to be safe online Meta Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis told NPR in an email. We dont allow content that promotes suicide selfharm or eating disorders and of the content we remove or take action on we identify over 99 of it before its reported to us. She did not comment directly on the Seattle public schools lawsuit. Jose Castenada a Google spokesperson said that the company which owns YouTube has introduced strong protections and dedicated features to prioritize their well being. He also did not comment directly on the lawsuit. A spokesperson for Snap and a spokesperson for TikTok said they could not comment on litigation but that users wellbeing is a priority. The school system says it doesnt have the resources to manage a crisis made worse by social media In the lawsuit Seattle Public Schools says the number of students who report feeling so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that they stopped doing some usual activities increased by 30 from 2009 when smartphones gained steam to 2019 by which time theyd become ubiquitous. Our students and young people everywhere face unprecedented learning and life struggles that are amplified by the negative impacts of increased screen time unfiltered content and potentially addictive properties of social media said Seattle Public Schools Superintendent Brent Jones in a statement. But the school system says it doesnt have enough staff to treat the growing number of students seeking mentalhealth counseling. Our obligation is to create the conditions for students to thrive and have high quality learning experiences said Jones. The harm caused by these companies runs counter to that. Nationwide just over half of all public school systems say they can effectively provide mental health services to students in need according to the National Center of Education. The Seattlebased law firm Keller Rohrback is representing the school district in the lawsuit on a contingency basis which means attorneys will not get paid unless they win and companies are required to pay a fine according to Tim Robinson the head of media relations for Seattle Public Schools. Tech companies have a powerful legal shield but its about to be challenged Its nearly impossible to sue social media companies over the content on their platforms because of a law known as Section 230. Part of the 1996 Communications Decency Act it says tech companies cant be held liable for what others share on their sites. But that could soon change. The Supreme Court will hear arguments next month in a case that aims to limit Section 230 and puts social media companies recommendation algorithms front and center. Those recommendation formulas are at the heart of the Seattle Public Schools lawsuit too. Right now the public school system has a very steep legal road to climb according to Ryan Calo a professor at University of Washingtons School of Law. But if the plaintiffs in the case before the Supreme Court are successful it could open the door to this kind of argument he said. Calo is not involved in either lawsuit but he does have two children in Seattle Public Schools one in 7th grade and the other in 3rd. He said isnt surprised that this is happening in Seattle the home of tech giants including Amazon and Microsoft which has always been at the forefront of the internet and the digital world. Even if the case never gets its day in court its filing allows the school district to draw attention to the issue Calo said. They can do so as a pretty compelling and sympathetic plaintiff in the form of a school district that cares about its kids.,"It’s 2023, Instagram should make an iPad app",Extremely Negative,400,"['refusal', 'ripped', 'dud', 'lack', 'frustrating', 'problem', 'problem', 'losing', 'dense', 'limits', 'worse']","['killed', 'killed']","[Parker, Ortolani, Kardashians, Mark, Zuckerberg]"

After a few failed attempts at building wider social networks Apple has hit upon a smallerscale strategy that allows users to share items to the big social sites with ease and on a more personal level as well. We dont often think of Apples various efforts at helping users engage each other as a social network in the same sense as Tik Tok Instagram FaceBook Snapchat Mastodon or whats left of Twitter. But there is a social element built into many of Apples popular apps. After a few failed attempts to be truly social the companys approach is now focused on smaller communities of friends family or other groups. For example you can compete against friends playing the same games whether in Apple Arcade or through many thirdparty apps as long as they support Game Center. More recently Apple introduced a new way to share photos among your friends or family with iCloud Photo Library and has made it easy to pin group chats and do more together in Messages and FaceTime. Youll notice that the key dependency behind Apples social opportunities mostly revolves around others in your circle who are also using Apple products and services. Although of course interacting with all the big social networks and rival services like those from Google and Microsoft are supported this is largely the responsibility of those other companies made painless for users by Apples App Store marketplace. For several years now the share sheet and its corresponding icon in most apps including many thirdparty ones has been the chief way to send items from your own libraries or from the web to individuals or groups. Apple though takes a strong interest in helping users to share content on a smaller scale to their loved ones and reallife contacts in particular. Being social in Game Center Music and Photos Game Center which is supported in many iOSiPadOS and Mac games allows players to play along with or against friends or find other players to set up competitions. Depending on the game there may be a leaderboard achievements realtime multiplayer matches or points rewards. Apples Music app also has a social element where users can post profiles that feature what they are listening to and see the profiles of friends. This is intended to help you discover new artists and music and recommendations from friends you know and trust. Another important element of Apple Music is the ability to search playlists posted by other users and make your own playlists available for others to find. These playlists are shareable on other websites and social media sites as well widening the circle of people you can share your musical interests or discoveries with. There are even thirdparty tools designed to transfer playlists in Spotify to Apple Music or viceversa. It is also now possible to use a shortcut to share a created playlist in Apple Music to your friends who use Spotify or in the other direction via social media though it requires a bit of configuring. The Photos app can also of course let you upload pictures to social media sites or save photos posted by others. Once again Apples builtin features make it easy to share photos directly to your more personal circle of friends and family but also to the wider world if desired. By sharing via Messages Email or AirDrop there are a variety of ways to send or share pictures to people directly. Photos Shared Albums features allows users to create albums and invite friends and family who are also using Apple devices to contribute pictures Live Photos and videos. Being social with Messages and Group FaceTime As weve seen Apples own implementation of social features now is largely based around small world ideas realworld friends family and your socialmedia friend circle and less around whole world public sharing such as websites or public pages on social media. Apple has toyed with whole world sharing before with iWeb and Ping later Connect efforts that didnt fully take off going all the way back to the pioneering concept behind eWorld. This strategy has led to greater success with Messages and Group FaceTime in particular being extremely popular with AirDrop having also found a sizable audience and some notoriety with the public. The ability to create group chats and pin them has proven to be a big hit even finding popularity in business environments. Apple has also augmented Messages and FaceTime with an additional social feature SharePlay which allows a group to listen or watch together to movies audio and other media. A number of third parties have opted into the technology and in general the public has embraced Apples version of listeningviewing parties especially for people who cant be together in person. FaceTime has long been seen as the highestquality of the various videocalling services but it was limited to just Apple users unlike Messages until the company created a way for others to join via web links. Additional features in FaceTime like Center Stage available on devices with ultrawide cameras can move the focus or create a brilliant topdown effect for demonstrations leveraging the power of Apples Mclass chips and the outstanding cameras in iPhones. The feature set and privacy of Group FaceTime audio or video calling make it nearly effortless for small groups to enjoy conversations or meetings for free worldwide and have turned it into an invaluable resource for travelers. AirDrop the epitome of Apples small world social strategy By contrast Apples popular AirDrop technology has been used for over 10 years to quickly send files photos or other media from an iPhone exclusively to nearby Apple devices. This can either be targeted directly to a nearby device or sent out to everyone in a small radius typically 30 feet or so with an Apple device nearby that has WiFi and Bluetooth turned on. One of the first mass uses of AirDrop was to send and receive contact information at technology gatherings like CES but friend and family groups have also adopted it. It is pretty simple to explain even to people who arent adept with technology how to turn on AirDrop at least temporarily on their iPhone iPad or Mac. Of course if a user has their AirDrop settings to send to or receive from everyone there is an opportunity for abuse. Apple recommends a default setting of Contacts Only but there are times when Everyone will help you send or receive easily in a group. Apple has recently changed AirDrops Everyone status to only be active for 10 minutes first in China and then worldwide. It is unclear if Apple initially did this in response to the Chinese governments displeasure at protesters using the feature to share information but it can also be a help in preventing unwanted visuals appearing as part of the accept or reject process. At present more traditional methods like email or text messaging must be used if a recipient is using a nonApple platform. However since it is built on common networking standards like Bluetooth and WiFi Apple could consider expanding AirDrop compatibility to Windows or perhaps even Android. Apples philosophy has the sideeffect of mostly relying on Apples technology and leveraging FOMO the fear of missing out to convince family and friends to buy in on Apple products as well.,3 reasons why Seattle schools are suing Big Tech over a youth mental health crisis,Generally Neutral,750,"['harmful', 'crisis', 'accuses', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'hard', 'ignore', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'bullying', 'vulnerable', 'excessive', 'issue', 'dangerous', 'risks', 'unwanted', 'limit', 'crisis', 'worse', 'sad', 'hopeless', 'struggles', 'negative', 'harm', 'impossible', 'sue', 'liable', 'limit', 'steep', 'issue']","['abuse', 'suicide']","['lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', Frances, Haugen, Meta, Global, Antigone, Davis, 'lawsuit', Jose, Castenada, 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', Brent, Jones, Jones, 'lawsuit', Tim, Robinson, 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', 'lawsuit', Ryan, Calo, Calo, 'lawsuit', Calo]"
21,"We Think in 3D. Social Media Should, Too",Social media still argues in two dimensions about real world issues.,https://time.com/6246077/social-media-3d/,Cooperation the thing we need most to solve big problems in the world is being collapsed by the thing that promised to connect us and bring us closer together social media. The problem is that social connection isnt actually the business modelengagement is. Social media platforms TikTok Instagram Snapchat Twitter and more make choices to show usthe userscontent that is most engaging. Unfortunately what is most engaging isnt always aligned with what we value. What gets the most engagementfollows shares and commentsare the fights takedowns and proverbial car crashes we cant take our eyes from. Seeing more divisive content pushes us further into polarized ways of thinking on every topicwhich spills over into our offline lives and makes cooperation a taller and taller task. Yet todays world requires unprecedented levels of coordination and cooperation to meet unprecedented challenges. Whether it is climate change reducing crime or how to harness and keep humanity safe in increasingly AIdriven realities our most pressing problems depend upon a shared reality. In the image above if we focus from one angle the 3D cylinders shadow looks like a 2D squarebut if you look from the other angle the cylinders shadow looks like a 2D circle. People standing on either side might fight back and forth yelling more and more loudly at each other over which 2D shape is true increasingly convinced that the other side is wrong. Meanwhile they would be missing the higherdimensional cylinder which requires synthesizing multiple perspectives. Todays social media is designed in a way that rewards us for arguing in 2D about 3D issuesseeing the world in squares and circles. Narrowly framed debates about circles and squares dont actually resolve our 3D problems. Take the issue of climate change 2D squarescircles ask Is climate change really an existential risk or overblown media hype While the 3Dcylinder perspective question remains What tradeoffs do we collectively want between economic growth energy needs global security and emissions required for that growth Additionally the classic social media debate between free speech and censorship is a circlesquare debate. Should platforms allow free speech Or should platforms moderate content to keep users safe Which is right the circle or the square Or can we ask a 3Dcylinder question What kind of information ecosystem design and incentives will reward the most goodfaith marketplace of ideas For example for all the talk of Twitter as a public square there is a big difference between the speech rewarded if that public square is designed like a Roman Colosseum that incentivizes violence and chaos compared with the speech rewarded by a Quaker meeting that incentivizes reflection. Cylindrical perspectives allow for nuance and promote a synthesis of ideasnot merely consensus or tyranny of the masses but a merging of ideas into a Venn diagram of agreement. By taking a cylinder view we learn that we actually can discuss complex topics and reach cooperative solutions required in democratic societies. Technology is made up of design choices. Engagement as a business model produced choices that have gotten us into the 2D situation were in. But we can make new design choices. Software is malleable. We can rebuild existing technology and design new ones with a more humane philosophy that strengthens our capacities for synthesis and cooperation. Rather than fall into the trap of 2D debates on this issue of free speech vs. content moderation we can take a collaborative 3D perspective. Change wont be easy but the cooperation we need to tackle all of our other existential challenges is at stake.

22,Apple needs another hit product. But the rumored new AR/VR glasses will not be it.,"Michael Gartenberg, a former Apple exec and Gartner analyst, doesn't think Apple will succeed with the glasses where others have struggled.",https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-new-products-ar-vr-glasses-2022-12,Apple needs another hit product. But the rumored new ARVR glasses will not be it. Apple is widely rumored to be releasing augmentedrealityvirtualreality glasses in 2023. It needs another hit product. But ARVR glasses have struggled with consumers. With the market for smartphones wellsaturated Apple needs to look to new markets for its next big thing. While the iPod led to the iPhone as I previously wrote Apples most recent products like Watch or AirPods are nice highmargin additions to sell to iPhone users. But they are much like ordering fries and a drink to go with a burger. They dont create an ecosystem that Apple can grow. They rely on the iPhones ecosystem. It has long been rumored that Apple will create a car to take on the likes of Tesla. That would be an example of a new market for Apple. But I dont think an Apple car is going to happen and thats a topic for another time. What does seem likely is that Apple will release augmentedrealityvirtualreality glasses rumored to be coming in 2023 with an OS called xrOS. While Im always excited to see what innovations companies like Apple have in store I have some serious concerns about betting on ARVR glasses as a growth market. Weve already seen some attempts in this space including Microsoft HoloLens and Magic Leap. They have not exactly taken the world by storm. When was the last time you or anyone you know saw someone using those devices at their places of work or out in the wild Glass from Google I think its safe to say was a failure. And Snapchats Spectacles are not even for sale to the general public the companys website says only to developers. Then there are VR products like Oculus from Meta and competitors from Valve Sony and HP. These have made some inroads with gamers but years after they were introduced theyre still a small fraction of the enormous videogaming market. As for other uses We have so far seen none despite Mark Zuckerbergs diehard belief that the metaverse is the future of our social lives and work meetings and whatnot. There is a belief however that Apple which isnt usually first to market can enter a space and succeed where no one has before. When it comes to this market Im more than a little skeptical. First and foremost the battery life of an AR device is a major concern. AR as Google Glass and Snapchat Spectacles envisioned it is meant to be worn for long periods of time and superimpose digital imagery and functions onto the real world. While Apple has not released specifications on this front or any other it seems highly unlikely that any device in this category will work for extended periods without recharging. Plus despite all the ways that Apple is a leader in elegant hardware design battery life is not really its strong point. In the world of smartwatches for example some Garmin devices last as long as two weeks reviewers found while an Apple Watch in my experience gives a user two or three days. Theres also the question of comfort. Glasses are not the most comfortable things to wear for extended periods of time. And when you add the weight and bulk of the technology needed for AR and VR eyewear like this become more uncomfortable to wear. This is not to mention the fact that many people simply do not like wearing glasses at all which will limit the market for these products. Price is another major issue. Microsofts HoloLens costs between 3500 and 5200. Apples device is widely expected to be in the 1000 to 1500 price range even though Apple is known for selling premium devices with premium price tags. But even on the low end thats a significant investment for a product that will do far less than a comparably priced MacBook or iPad. Beyond the practical concerns of battery life comfort and price theres the fundamental issue of the lack of a compelling use case for AR or VR glasses. While these technologies have some exciting potential it is not yet clear beyond certain types of video games what the killer app will be to make them a musthave for consumers. All that is to say while Apples ARVR project may be interesting to diehard Apple fans and tech enthusiasts who buy into Apples marketing machine and wait in lines to buy its products on day one I dont believe its the companys next big thing. Until Apple or any other company can demonstrate a truly compelling reason for large numbers of people to want to wear AR around or add VR to their quiver of homeentertainment options I fear that the tech will struggle to gain widespread adoption. There is a reason Oculus devices have created a category known as closetware a gadget that winds up stored and forgotten somewhere in a closet.

24,Frequent Social Media Checks May Affect Young Brains,"A new study examines whether frequent checking of social media sites (Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat) is associated with changes in functional brain development in these early adolescents, about age 12.",https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20230104/frequent-social-media-checks-may-affect-young-brains,By Cara Murez HealthDay Reporter TUESDAY Jan. 3 2023 HealthDay News Social medias impact on young people is a hot topic with most kids and teens wanting to do whatever their friends are doing and parents worrying about setting limits. A new study examines whether frequent checking of social media sites Facebook Instagram and Snapchat is associated with changes in functional brain development in these early adolescents about age 12. Using brain scans called functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI researchers at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that habitually refreshing and checking social media may be associated with changes in brain sensitivity to social rewards and punishments those online likes and engagement from others. We know that adolescence is one of the most important periods for brain development its going through more changes in reorganization second only to that we see in early infancy said study author Eva Telzer who is an associate professor of psychology and neuroscience. Its a really dramatic period of brain development in particular in these brain regions that respond to social rewards. Social rewards arent limited to social media sites. They can be positive facetoface feedback from peers or even receiving money. But those Facebook likes are social rewards too. Other research has found that some adolescents are on their cellphones almost constantly checking their social media at least hourly. For the threeyear study Telzers team recruited 169 sixth and seventhgraders from three public middle schools in rural North Carolina. Participants were racially diverse and included both boys and girls. The participants reported how often they checked the three social media platforms varying from less than once a day to more than 20 times. The researchers used this information to make a scale. Then participants underwent fMRI brain scans. During these scans they would see a cue that social feedback would be a reward a punishment or neutral. They then had to quickly push a button when a target appeared. The teens would then get a social reward or punishment. We can take pictures of their brain and see which brain regions are activated when they see these social rewards and which brain regions are changing over those three years in response to anticipating that peer feedback Telzer said. Participants who at age 12 were checking social media upwards of 15 times a day showed differences in the way that their brains develop over the following three years Telzer said. And its in specific brain regions that are detecting the salience of the environment responding to those social rewards. Salience refers to which elements people are most drawn to and will focus their attention on. Telzer said this suggests that teens who grow up constantly checking their social media are becoming hypersensitive to peer feedback. Their brains are responding more and more and more over those years to that social reward feedback that they are anticipating Telzer said. What isnt clear is what this means for their future. It could potentially lead the brain to become more and more sensitive to social feedback and this could continue into adulthood Telzer said. But researchers havent tried to see if they can change this trajectory. While the brain changes might promote compulsive or addictive social media behaviors they may also reflect an adaptation that helps teens navigate their increasingly digital world. We dont know if this is good or bad if the brain is adapting in a way that allows teens to navigate and respond to the world they live in it could be a very good thing Telzer said. If it is becoming compulsive and addictive and taking away from their ability to engage in their social world it could potentially be maladaptive. She said parents can help their teens by fostering activities that bring joy without going online for instance sports art or volunteering. Its a thoughtprovoking associational study said Dr. Kevin Staley neurologist and chief of pediatric neurology service at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who reviewed the findings. Were all worried that compulsive use of social media is going to alter development in adolescence. More research would be required to know for sure that social media changes adolescent brains he said. For example researchers might see what happens if they take away kids phones for six months to prevent frequent social media checks. Staley added that fMRI is an intriguing window into the brain but still crude given the complexity of brain circuitry. Theres a lot of different things those circuits could be doing and we dont have a window into what theyre doing he said. Yet parents want to know the impact that social media will have on their kids and whether they should limit it Staley noted. This study is really sort of an early stepping stone to the evidentiary path that would give us reason to act one way or the other he said adding that it is too early to make a recommendation based on these findings. For now parents will need to use common sense about social media. I think it reinforces how many things are changing during early adolescence Staley said. We all tend to suppress all the angst that we underwent during that period but there was a reason that it was hard because your brain changes in radical ways preparing for adulthood. And this study shows that this is something that could be physically measured. The findings were published online Jan. 3 in JAMA Pediatrics.

25,5 Business Predictions for 2023 Following the Downward Spiral in Tech,"The most prominent tech titans announced tens of thousands of layoffs this year. With markets down over 30%, what's next in 2023, and how do we prepare for the recession?",https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/5-predictions-for-2023-following-the-downward-spiral-in-tech/440368,5 Business Predictions for 2023 Following the Downward Spiral in Tech The most prominent tech titans announced tens of thousands of layoffs this year. With markets down over 30 whats next in 2023 and how do we prepare for the recession Entrepreneurcontributors are their own. At the beginning of the quarter one share of Meta Platforms Inc the parent company of Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp was traded at 378. Less than two months in the technological juggernaut collapsed to under 89 a share reaching the trading levels of 2015. But Meta is not alone. The Nasdaq 100 took a 38 hit from its peak. Layoffs have followed suit across the titans of technology with tens of thousands of employees losing jobs across Meta Amazon Microsoft and Twitter alone. Heading into 2023 the future is tumultuous. What geoeconomic changes are about to resurface in the new year Related VCs Are Missing Out on New Innovative Ideas. Heres Why and What They Can Do About It. 1. Reassessment of the Hockey Stick. A favorite trend of venture capital funds and investors is the promise of the hockey stick growth curve. This translates to a predictable and scalable influx of new users or revenue subject to doubling down on sales or paid acquisition channels. The premise is straightforward market penetration or even domination. Obtaining unicorn status and acquiring users at all costs. The model works in theory but in the land of funding this usually comes at the expense of piles of debt and no profit whatsoever. Its easy to scale a business with a freemium model that gets funded by investors. But infrastructure staff warehouses and vendors are entitled to their own funding. And unless this model converts at the same pace as a standard business cost plus a profit margin companies will face severe consequences. Prioritizing profitability again will become a reality check of 2023. Related How to Maintain Profitability in a Changing Market 2. More layoffs Over 910 tech companies laid off over 143000 employees in 2022 alone. The tracker relies on public data that doesnt account for medium and large businesses outside the public purview whereas the numbers are likely to exceed 200000 or even 250000 at the time. Financial scrutiny combined with unfavored financing tools thanks to the aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve is limiting access to funding to combat the effects of hyperinflation. With unlimited resources its easy to get sidetracked and keep pouring more people money and servers into a problem. This anecdotally conflicts with Brookss law a known adagio in project and product management where adding workforce to a software project thats running late is dragging it even further. While unemployment rates are still normalized the pressure on hightech and communications will disrupt the current numbers over the first two quarters of 2023. Related Amazon CEO Andy Jassy Announces Most Difficult Decision in More Bad News for the Tech Giant Next Year 3. Salary normalization in IT TCI Fund Management an Alphabet Googles parent company stakeholder issued an open letter to CEO Sundar Pichai. Billionaire Christopher Hohn called out Googles overhiring practices and its passive actions compared to other industry leaders. Moreover the letter pointed at the disparity of salaries in high tech and even among Google compared to other competitive companies where median compensation totaled 295884 in 2021. Hohns further analysis quantified the comp offer as 67 higher than at Microsoft and 153 higher than the 20 largest listed technology companies in the US. Competitive salaries are a key instrument for leading brands to acquire top talent. However scrutinizing the future of existing business models such as the downside of advertising businesses in social companies or tens of billions invested in the metaverse by Meta requires careful consideration and getting back to operational efficiency first and foremost. Related Are We Headed for a Recession Its Complicated. 4. Pushback on remote work Remote work has been a conflicting topic at best. In 2010 I was openly advocating for the adoption of remote work quoting Ciscos 2009 study of cost savings and employee satisfaction and success stories by companies like Automattic or Basecamp. As the 2020 pandemic made it possible for office jobs it was a blessing to tens of millions of workers. However several conflicts arose Public records on social media and interviews with employees taking endless lunch breaks leaving their computers on or casually responding to emails while playing video games or at the gym Managers trying to combat the lack of remote principles with endless waves of Zoom and Teams meetings taking over 20 hours a week for senior leaders and experts The goal of becoming over employed while being shielded from office peers or monitoring gathered over 120000 disciples on Reddit alone Workers moving across the country or even internationally causing actual employment violations in adhering to insurance or health policies in most countries lacking working permits and masking their locations During the boom of 2021 corporations negating remote work opportunities were dismissed or even publicly banished. With a recession coming in this talent pool is the first one to crack for many business leaders. Related Why 2022 Is All About Asynchronous Communication 5. Limited innovation The reality check and the renowned focus on profitability come at the hidden cost of innovation. A key reason why most technology leaders are taking a hit is a dip in revenue. Facebook Instagram Twitter Snapchat and YouTube rely heavily on ads to support their freemium networks. Other businesses are also pressured to cut costs due to limited business opportunities and expectations of salary raises. For many sales and marketing especially advertising expenses are the first lines of cuts. Microsofts computer sales plummeted and Amazons shipped revenue is declining as hyperinflation raises costs while employees net worth stays flat. The international energy crisis is fueling inflation further making the problem worse. As tech companies get pressured and layoffs occur this often starts with sectors that lose money. Innovation and RD think of autonomous vehicles the Metaverse new cryptocurrencies or digital wallets or blockchain adoption for networks that currently operate on a clientserver model slow down or get frozen for the time being. As spare money is no longer available this hits consumers and other tangible markets from the broader crypto world with several large exchanges filing for bankruptcy to a massive dip in selling NFTs or any unproven asset classes only made popular due to stable income and influx of capital during the past few years. Everyone is affected The most important takeaway here is that everyone is affected by the recent crash in tech. The Great Recession of 2008 started with real estate and banking but this carried over consumers losing their households due to interest hikes construction companies going out of business unemployment rates going from 5 to 10 and negative GDP affecting retail restaurants travel logistics manufacturing. The house of cards trickles down to dependent people and businesses. Even if your business appears to be doing well at the time buckle up and keep an eye on the latest industry news.

26,Holy Guacamole – Chipotle Will Target Gen Z Via Snapchat Lens Campaign,"While Snapchat has been overshadowed by TikTok, it still has a very significant Gen Z user base",https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2023/01/03/holy-guacamole--chipotle-will-target-gen-z-via-snapchat-lens-campaign/,The New Year is typically when many Americans will try to start a new diet or otherwise adopt a healthier lifestyle. To take advantage of such resolutions Chipotle will target Gen Z and millennial consumers with a new AR Lens Snapchat and a lineup of Lifestyle Bowls which will be available via its digital menu. Designed to promote wellness the fastcasual restaurant chains Snapchat Lens will include mediation prompts and exercises via an augmented reality AR experience. It is the first wellnessthemed lens to be produced by a restaurant brand and Chipotle will reward 100000 of the lens users with free guacamole. The AR lens will launch on January 13 also known as Quitters Day when most people are likely to forfeit their New Years resolutions. We created seven new Lifestyle Bowls that embrace Gen Z and Millennials modern interpretation of wellbeing said Chris Brandt chief marketing officer at Chipotle. Were making new years resolutions fun by gamifying the experience and offering balanced meals made with real ingredients that you feel good eating. Targeting Gen Z Via Social Media The fastcasual brand is embracing how younger Americans are now redefining wellness where there has been a shift away from diet culture and instead follows individualized holistic interpretations. It is also taking a lead by targeting these younger consumers via social media. This is a generation of digital natives who were raised on immediacy and personalization explained brand marketing expert Scott Steinberg. This is the audience that literally expects everything to be a swipe away. The campaign may also make those who crave their massive burrito fixes feel less guilty for piling on the guacamole and sour cream. This is certainly the generation that is hyperaware of what they are putting in their bodies added Steinberg. Chipotle is creating healthier food options or at least making them seem like a healthier option to a burger and a shake. Theyre also creating exercise options to work off those calories. It further makes sense they would go to a social media network to connect with this audience while at the same time reminding users that a customized burrito or bowl may be just a click away. Instead of making an overt ad they are trying to make it a value add said Steinberg. The AR campaign is also notable even if Snapchat doesnt quite have the reach of other social media platforms. While Snapchat has been overshadowed by TikTok it still has a very significant Gen Z user base said social media analyst Greg Sterling cofounder of Near Media. The two apps arent mutually exclusive Sterling continued. Snapchat lenses have proven to be in the past extremely effective promotional tools. This one also looks promising. And the free guac is certainly an incentive to use it. If it breaks out it would certainly be emulated. In fact it is likely that other food chains could take a cue from the campaign. Absolutely. We should expect more and more food purveyors to engage with an audience on social media and over time this is going to become increasingly commonplace Steinberg suggested. The issue is that as other eateries embrace these tools it could be harder for them to stand out. Chipotle was just very smart about the timing as everybody is trying to think about wellness especially at the beginning of the New Year Steinberg added. Bonus points if they sell more burritos in the process,"

27,"What Is Paid Media: Types & Examples via @sejournal, @brookeosmundson","Paid media is different from PPC advertising, but relates to a broader advertising scope. Learn the difference with these examples and find what works.
The post What Is Paid Media: Types & Examples appeared first on Search Engine Journal.",https://www.searchenginejournal.com/paid-media-types-examples/473959/,The term paid media is commonly used in the marketing industry. Some use the term paid media interchangeably with PPC advertising but oftentimes it relates to a broader advertising scope. This comprehensive guide will teach you what paid media is and what it isnt the difference between different media types and offer indepth examples. What Is Paid Media Paid media is any marketing effort that contains a paid placement. While paid media is often used interchangeably with the term costperclick CPC its important to note the differentiation. Paid media is used broadly to describe a channel tactic or strategy within the digital landscape. It does not specify certain channels or even necessarily between search social or other awareness advertising. The Difference Between Earned Owned And Paid Media Paid media is not the only media to drive awareness and demand. Earned media and owned media are vital pieces of a successful brand strategy. Its important not to confuse the three types of media as each serves its own purpose. Lets take a look at the key differences. Earned media Any type of brand exposure gained from methods other than paid advertising. Owned media Any type of content your brand creates and controls. Some examples of earned media include Social sharing from customers. Customer reviews. External media coverage public relations. Owned media examples include Your website. Social media channels. Blog posts. Types Of Paid Media Channels Now that weve identified the definition of paid media lets take a look at the different types of paid media channels and the purposes they serve. Before we dive into the different paid media channels its also important to note the difference between ad formats and ad channels. Ad formats are the type of ads shown in a particular channel. An ad format example could be Search ad. Video ad. Display ad. Banner ad. So while ad formats are important and will depend on the channel below we will focus on the channels themselves. There are other types of paid media channels available that are not listed here such as more traditional methods like direct mail or billboards. These paid media channels have a more physical presence and here we will focus on digital channels. Paid Search The most common platforms in paid search are Google and Bing search engines. Google is the leading search engine in market share with its sites generating around 61 of user searches in the United States. Microsoft Bing is the second leading search engine generating almost 27 of user searches across its network of sites. Less commonly used search engines that users leverage are Yahoo. Ask Network. AOL. The most common ad format on search engines is textbased. However depending on the context of a users search other formats may be shown such as a Shopping ad. Shopping ad formats consist mainly of a product image name price and description. Paid Social Paid social platforms have truly transformed over the past few years. Not only are there more social platforms to choose from but there are also more ways for brands to advertise on each platform. Some of the most common paid social platforms include Meta Facebook. Instagram. LinkedIn. TikTok. Pinterest. Snapchat. Twitter. The most common ad format in social channels is placed within a users newsfeed as they scroll. These ads will either consist of one or more static images or a video as the main visual. Additionally most paid social platforms offer different placement types for sponsored ads. For example Instagram and Snapchat can show ads between user stories. Some paid social platforms are more beneficial for B2B companies than for B2C brands. For example LinkedIn advertising consists mainly of B2B brands marketing their product or service to other professionals. Other platforms like TikTok and Snapchat may be better suited for B2C or ecommerce brands. Whatever paid social channel you choose from just make sure that your target audience is there as well. Programmatic Display Display ads are shown on a variety of channels and networks. Ads are displayed on numerous websites and apps depending on the network. While programmatic refers to the strategy of whenwherehow to publish ads display refers to the actual format of ads shown. One of the most common display channels is the Google Display Network GDN. This differs from programmatic because the GDN is a closed network owned by Google. The channels programmatic uses for its ad buys are comprised of the channels listed here. Affiliate Marketing This type of marketing is when a company or brand pays affiliates for each sale they contribute. One of the biggest channels for affiliate marketing is through bloggers. A blogger will mention another product or brand in their post and then get paid for every sale attributed back to that blog post. This type of marketing is beneficial because it allows your brand to expand and scale its reach through other popular influencers in your space. Other popular affiliate marketing channels include Email lists. Coupon sites. Review sites. The beauty of affiliate marketing is that you can pick your partners and publishers. You should always choose partners aligned with your companys objectives and goals. Examples Of Paid Media This is where the ad formats are married to the paid media channels. Below are examples of paid media ads from the popular channels listed above. These examples can help provide context when deciding what types of paid media to run. Search Examples When searching for top parental control apps in Google the first two positions are examples of search ads. While conducting the same search on Microsoft Bing the ads look slightly different When searching for a product like nike shoes for women the ads below are a shopping ad format. Paid Social Examples Each social platforms ad formats look different within their respective newsfeeds. Here is a LinkedIn newsfeed example A Facebook ad newsfeed example Instagram also offers ads in its Stories placement. An example from Marriott is below Display Examples Display ads can be in all shapes and sizes depending on the website or app. Below is an example of three different display ads shown on one webpage. Affiliate Examples Sometimes affiliate ads can be difficult to spot. For example Listicle articles have become a hot commodity where a publisher is paid by other brands to be included in a Top product article. However if you take a closer look at this examples Advertising Disclosure youll notice that this publisher is paid by the brands for exclusive placement Summary Paid media is a crucial component of any marketing strategy and can deliver fast results. However you should not fully rely on paid media to drive sustainable growth by itself. The appropriate paid media channels for your brand should be determined by your goals and where your target audience spends their time. Creating a holistic plan comprising paid earned and owned media helps your company maximize reach with your customers and reduce marketing costs over time.

28,The Anti-Sports Personality of the Year awards 2022,"The pick of the dark, devious and downright dumb sporting stories – and the antiheroes behind themAlcohol, sportspeople and common sense are rarely seen together, and it’s been another year full of salutary stories. Take, for example, the South Korean three-t…",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/dec/20/the-anti-sports-personality-of-the-year-awards-2022,Robert Milkins Alcohol sportspeople and common sense are rarely seen together and its been another year full of salutary stories. Take for example the South Korean threetime Olympic medalwinning speed skater Kim Minseok who in August gave three fellow skaters a lift home from a friends birthday party at the national training centre near Seoul drove straight into a crash barrier and earned an 18month ban from the sport two of his passengers were banned for six months for abetting drink driving and a coach who wasnt even there got a year for lack of oversight Kim never got as far as a public road and thus avoided criminal prosecution. But the years most humiliating boozerelated sporting incident came in Antalya in March when the English snooker player Robert Milkins turned up for the opening ceremony of the Turkish Masters having already enthusiastically celebrated his birthday drunkenly confronted a senior official injured himself falling over in the toilets and ended up having his stomach pumped in hospital. I genuinely dont know exactly what happened I was in a state where I didnt know where I was he said. When I got to the toilet I lost my legs and think I hit my chin on the sink or the ground cutting it open. I was almost knocked out and Im pretty sure I have broken ribs. If I had my stomach pumped I dont remember that either. The bump on the head cant have damaged him too badly after 27 years as a professional in which he had never got his hands on a trophy he won his next tournament the Gibraltar Open. Draymond Green There are apologies and there are apologies and basketball player Draymond Green was truly in a sorry state in October after video emerged of him landing a proper fullon right hook on his Golden State Warriors teammate Jordan Poole in practice. I failed as a man said the longtime controversymagnet. I am a very flawed human being. Green has repeatedly proved as much his previous greatest hits including being suspended for a crucial game of the 2016 NBA finals after whacking LeBron James in the groin accidentally posting a picture of his own very much unclothed groin on Snapchat he said it was intended to be a private message and that were all one click away from placing something in the wrong place and another suspension for arguing with another teammate Kevin Durant. None of this seems to have particularly damaged his selfesteem. Im the best defender to ever play this game he says. 100. Also hitting someone he shouldnt have this year Indian wrestler Satender Malik who punched a referee after losing the under125kg final at his countrys Commonwealth Games qualifiers and was duly banned for life. A few weeks later he was banned for another four years if such a thing is possible having allegedly run away from the venue without informing anyone after being summoned for a dope test. Elton Jantjies Its been a memorable year for 42times capped South African rugby union international Elton Jantjies. In May he returned alone from a family holiday to Turkey a journey so unusual that upon arrival in Johannesburg he was immediately arrested for malicious damage to property. Apparently he had broken a glass and damaged the screen and the light at his business class seat while a passenger in economy claimed of seeing him totter to a toilet he struggled to keep his balance and bang on the door so hard his knuckles bled all the while beseeching the air hostess who had locked herself inside for her own protection to komaan my skat Afrikaans for come on my darling. By the time he gave up there was blood all over the toilet door. In September he was sent home from a tour of Argentina after reports emerged of him leaving the team hotel and checking into a different one with the teams dietician Zeenat Simjee. He admitted the affair while Simjees lawyer insisted he had been not with her but with another woman. She went with the team on their winter trip to Europe but Jantjies stayed in South Africa and moved into a rehab facility for a mental break and to treat his insomnia. As a flyhalf I believe to be playing Test rugby I need to be sleeping perfectly he said. Jacob Runyan and Chase Cominsky It has been an epic year for cheating controversies and conspiracies a year in which the concept of vibrating anal beads in chess for better or worse leaped irreversibly into the public consciousness. But who from this crowded field deserves a place in the AntiSpoty spotlight Step forward Runyan and Cominsky and the moment the successful fishing duo were knocked off their perch and also their pike their bass and their catfish. It was not the first time the pairs integrity had been questioned after they won the Fall Brawl on Lake Erie last year Cominsky failed a mandatory polygraph test meaning they were denied the first prize of a 125000 boat happily they passed the tests for another competition they won that same weekend sailing home with a 152000 boat. Back then Runyan said the pair were pursuing legal recourse adding that he was pretty good at picking out where theres shady stuff going on. Sadly for him so was Jason Fischer director of this years Lake Erie Walleye Trail who in September grew suspicious about the impressive weight of the less impressively sized fish Runyan and Cominsky had landed sliced one open and started pulling out lead weights. Instead of netting them a prize of 28760 they found themselves in hot water for a change charged with one count apiece of cheating attempted grand theft possessing criminal tools and unlawful ownership of wild animals. They also inspired major fishing competitions to start investing in metal detectors. The pair pleaded not guilty to the charges. This has been terrible for fishing as a sport said Ron Taylor a semipro bass fisherman. Its been hard on the people who are playing by the rules and I think for people who just like to hear about catching big fish. Sander van Ginkel It was a Winter Olympics year which is basically a guarantee of controversy and Van Ginkel took the gold medal in a hotly competed field pipping the mixed team ski jumping jumpsuitbased disqualification madness. Van Ginkel was the sports scientist employed by the Dutch speed skating team who mounted a strategic influencing campaign on Beijings Canadian icemaster Mark Messer in an attempt to force him into making ice that would suit his nations skaters. Far from hiding his involvement he happily gave interviews about it. The colder the ice the harder it gets he explained. Many other countries produce skaters who have more of a shorter stroke and for whom hard ice is less important. I try to create the best possible conditions for our skaters and I hope to convince Messer and his people of my ideas. I think he and his staff are genuinely interested in what I have to say. This did not go down well with rival skaters. This is far from fair play this is corruption said Swedens Nils van der Poel. This is the biggest scandal in our sport. Weve had doping cases but I dont see this as being less serious. They have a guy whose job is to put pressure on the ice maker to change the ice for the benefit of the Netherlands. However the best ice for me is when the ice is bad. Im quite good when the ice is bad. The Dutch won six of 14 gold medals in the sport massively dominating the medals table but the ice cant have been that great Van der Poel won two golds of his own. AntiSpoty special award for gaslighting The state of Qatar for hosting in the middle of the World Cup the 2022 AntiCorruption Excellence Awards or to give them their official title after they were named in honour of the nations emir the Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad AlThani International Excellence Awards. For the first time this year an award was given specifically for a leader of the fight against corruption in sport among the guests for the ceremony Corruptions Fifas own Gianni Infantino. AntiSpoty quote of the year That stomach those abs those pictures you send so I can keep tabs You make me feel funny down there. Especially when youre there and you look up and stare Im gonna end by saying you are my love my friend my soul And most of all you believe in me which makes me as hard as a totem pole.
