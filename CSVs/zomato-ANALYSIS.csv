And for people who have a super hectic schedule this phenomenon occurs more often. But it seems a man from Pune went extra miles with ordering food Wondering what that means Okay let us spill the beans for you. According to Zomatos annual trend report 2022 a man from Pune ordered food worth over Rs. 28 lakh through the app. The person claimed the title of the biggest foodie by placing orders worth Rs 2859611 this year. You heard us. Zomato recently took to Instagram to share a post featuring highlights of 2022. The post also had a meme on Elon Mask carrying a sink at Twitters headquarters. Let that sink in the text read. Wait it doesnt end here. The report went on to share a picture of Ronaldo and Messi with a bowl of biryani at the centre. Biryani proved to be the GOAT this year too Zomato wrote. For the unversed the Zomato report revealed that biryani continued ruling hearts in 2022 with 186 orders of it delivered every minute. In another post Zomato gave a special mention to a person named Rahul who ordered 1098 cakes this year. Then comes a person named Tina from Kahargpur who spent Rs 25455 just on ordering pizzas that too in a single go. Wondering how she accommodated so many pizzas in her cart Well Zomato described this perfectly in a meme. If you think you have been ordering way too much food lately then look at Ankur from Delhi who placed 3330 orders this year which means approx. nine orders every day. Meanwhile Yash from Surat Gujarat stood out by saying thank you in the chat support every time his order got delivered. Sharing some unusual requests and searches made by customers Zomato roped in three sharks from Shark Tank India. Here some asked if the platform accepts Bitcoin nearly 80000 demanded extra oreganos in cooking instructions and some searched for breakup food. For the record biryani dominated the food orders as per Swiggys annual trend report too. It stated that 137 biryanis were ordered per minute in 2022.,2022-12-31T08:58:01Z,Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal delivers food to customers as orders surge on New Year's Eve,Extremely Positive,340.0,"allegations, false, mediocre, tragic, steals, Deficiency, Limited","suicide, conspiracy, firing, Terror, Sex","Deepinder, Goyal, deepigoyal, lawsuit, Naatu, Naatu, Deepika, Padukone, David, Warner, Pant, Dhoni, Tamanna, Inamdar"

The target still suggests a 45 per cent potential upside from Wednesday#39;s tradiong price of Rs 59.20 apiece.,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/kotak-sees-lower-gmv-for-zomato-in-short-term-cuts-target-price-to-rs-85-9774991.html,Predicting a subdued gross merchandise value GMV in the near term amid weaker demand brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities has cut the target price on the shares of Zomato Ltd. Kotak has cut its target price to Rs 85 a share from Rs 100 earlier targeted. The target still suggests a 45 percent potential upside from Wednesdays trading price of Rs 59. 20 apiece. Our conversations with industry participants indicate that food delivery GMV growth may remain subdued in the nearterm owing to weak demand. As a result we trim GMV growth forecasts for Zomatos food delivery segment. We like Zomatos comfortable market share position in a duopolistic market and believe the Indian delivery market has legs to grow nearterm slowdown notwithstanding Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to investors. After Zomato posted a 35 percent yearonyear food delivery GMV growth in the first half of FY23 the brokerage firm anticipates it to decelerate to 21 percent onyear in the second half of FY23. Although AOVs are likely to hold up due to inflation and relatively higher delivery charges slower growth in orders will lead to slower GMV growth Kotak said. This in turn is owing to weak consumer demand in what otherwise is a seasonally strong quarter for outdoor food consumption. We reckon the weakness is panIndia with a slowdown in demand in metro and nonmetro geographies. The fact that restaurant chains are also witnessing a slowdown indicates the slowdown is across channels and delivery is not necessarily losing share to instore dining Kotak said in a report. According to a Jefferies note on December 19 the brokerage firm has removed Zomato from its India Model Portfolio because it wanted to add weight to the metals sector with China reopening and the expectation of peaking of interest rates in the US. For the tactical move exiting Zomato we are incrementally wary of a potential rise in competitive activity in the sector As its chief competitor Swiggy has recently seen market share loss wrote Jeffereys Mahesh Nandurkar and Abhinav Sinha in the report.,2022-12-28T05:55:18Z,Pune Man Orders Food Worth Rs 28.6 Lakh In 2022: Zomato Shares,Extremely Negative,270.0,"hectic, sink, sink, Shark, breakup",-,"Elon, Mask, Ronaldo, Messi, lawsuit, Rahul, Tina, Ankur, Yash"

Most Read from Bloomberg What We Know About the Kraken Covid Variant XBB. 1. 5 and Why Its Causing Concern If You Have Student Loans Mark These Dates on Your Calendar Trumps Troubles Mount as Special Counsel Gets New 2020 Evidence Salesforce Guts Tableau After Spending 15. 7 Billion in 2019 Deal US and Germany to Send Ukraine Armored Vehicles in Major Arms Upgrade We are looking at new tech companies as their valuations have been reset Anand Radhakrishnan chief investment officer for equities at Franklin Templetons India unit said in an interview. More importantly there is data available about their business models. Initial public offerings of Indian internet firms boomed in 2021 thanks to pandemictriggered easymoney policy and government efforts to foster startups. The stocks were hit last year by caution over fundamentals and governance magnified by the impact of the global tech selloff amid Federal Reserve policy tightening. Radhakrishnan noted that some new tech firms have begun to show signs that they can generate profits supported by firstmover advantages and big market shares. Funds managed by Franklin Templeton bought at least 3. 3 million shares of ecommerce logistics provider Delhivery Ltd. and more than 2 million shares of PB Fintech Ltd. the operator of online insurance marketplace Policybazaar in November according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The purchases followed steep losses in the two stocks as well as One 97 Communications Ltd. parent of digital payments firm Paytm online food delivery company Zomato Ltd. and FSN ECommerce Ventures Pvt which owns beauty product eretailer Nykaa. Paytm suffered the most with its market capitalization shrinking 12. 7 billion. We didnt participate in these IPOs except Zomato but now we see a lot more transparency a lot more discussions with management are happening said Radhakrishnan who overseas assets valued at 7 billion. The firm whose 1. 3 billion India Flexi Cap Fund has outperformed 86 of its peers over the last three years recognizes the disruptive nature of some of these businesses and their mediumtolonger term ability to make money he said. Here are some other takeaways from interview with Radhakrishnan Stocks in India are likely to show a better performance in 2023 having undergone time and value correction over the past year. Valuations have become more moderate allowing the possibility of reasonable returns Debt investments in India have started looking attractive compared to a year ago but there remains scope for more exposure to stocks as local investors are under invested Local shares may come under pressure if the Indian government raises taxation on gains from equity trading or changes rules related. The market is not not correctly set up for that I think risk capital is scarce in the country and the relative tax advantage helps people to channelize savings to riskier capital avenues.

Ltd. cofounder and Chief Technology Officer Gunjan Patidar has resigned from the Indian food delivery startup becoming the fourth senior executive to quit the company since November. Patidar who had been with Zomato since it was founded almost 10 years ago was the key executive in charge of building the companys technology stack. Inc42 today reported that he was responsible for designing Zomatos core tech systems and also headed up a tech leadership team citing a filing the company made today. He also nurtured a tech leadership team that is capable of taking on the mantle of leading the tech function going forward the company said in the filing. His contribution to building Zomato has been invaluable. The departure of Patidar comes just weeks after Zomato cofounder Mohit Gupta who was head of its food delivery unit stepped down. Other key executives to leave the company in recent weeks include its new initiatives head Rahul Ganjoo and Siddharth Jhawar vice president for global growth. All three executives left the company in November. Zomato a restaurant aggregator and food delivery company that went public via a 12 billion initial public offering in August 2021 also said in November that it will be laying off about 3 of employees across its 3800member staff. Affected business units included its technology product and marketing teams the company said at the time. The departures of Zomatos executives come at a time when Chief Executive Deepinder Goyal also a cofounder has been attempting to share and delegate top responsibilities with other executives. Last August the company appointed four new chief executives across its leadership team. Zomato which is backed by Ant Group Goldman Sachs and Temasek is unprofitable reporting a loss of 30. 4 million during its most recent quarterly financial results in September.

It feels that the companys business is at an inflection point now. Piramal Pharma was demerged from Piramal Enterprises and got listed on the bourses in October last year. Though the performance has not been anything to write about. After listing at around Rs 201 it fell down to Rs 113 last week.

Last year when Zomato was in a free fall following the IPO lockin expiry brokerage firm Jefferies came out with a report titled night is darkest before dawn with target price that was about double of the prevailing prices. However it did not take much time for analysts at the firm to throw Zomato out of its India Model Portfolio citing a potential rise in competitive activity in the sector. Cusp of turnaround Piramal Pharmas contract development and manufacturing CDMO business is on the cusp of a turnaround as headwinds faced over the last 1218 months are getting resolved Dalal said. CDMO turnaround steady growth for complex hospital generics and scaleup of consumer health should drive 12 percent and 21 percent revenue and Ebitda CAGR over FY2225 and allay leverage concerns. According to the analyst the CDMO business of the company has faced execution challenges high attrition at overseas sites and margin impact from higher raw material cost over the last 1218 months which has weighed on the stock price.

Stable growth in the US inhalation anesthesia market where PPL has leadership position addition of fresh capacities and new injectable launches in nonUS markets should allow doubledigit growth over the next few years with a stable margin profile he added.

Increased adoption of the internet and smartphones rise in the number of working families especially the growing participation of women in the workforce and rapid lifestyle changes drives the market. Key growth drivers of the market The growing smartphone user base and increasing adoption of the internet are driving the demand for appbased online food ordering in India.

Key deterrent to the growth of the market Penetrating beyond tier II cities is a challenge because the online food delivery market in India is dominated by unorganized players. The rise of fake food shops on food delivery platforms has created inconveniences to both customers and food delivery executives.

Be it a stunning rally or a disappointing decline memes made some stocks eternal this year. Reddit Twitter and WhatsApp were all flooded by them and investors had a good laugh in a year marred by market volatility. Lets take a look at some. HDFC twins On April 4 before the market opened an announcement took everyone by surprise. A transformational merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank sent newsrooms into a scurry. It was not anticipated. There were hardly any whispers on such a deal brewing. I am disappointed with media intelligence said Deepak Parekh as he addressed reporters in a press conference. Nevertheless the announcement gave enough fodder to memers who unleashed their creativity. As the merger is all set to create a 160billion financial services behemoth investors were quick to liken it to Nawazuddin Siddiquis popular dialogue from Gangs of Wasseypur Kabhi kabhi lagta hai apun hi bhagwan hai. Adani Enterprises Akshay Kumar sported an eccentric polka dot shirt in Hera Pheri and claimed he can double your money in 25 days. That was a lie but Adani Enterprises has certainly managed to do so in the span of one year. The stock began its 2022 climb at Rs 1700 and is all set to end above Rs 3700. A big trigger was its entry into the Nifty 50 index in September. The flagship entity of Adani Group and its Chairperson Gautam Adani were in the limelight for many other reasons as well. A cement deal which makes it the secondlargest player in the space a media deal which made heads turn a blockbuster debut by the groups FMCG arm and a relentless rally that has propelled its promoter to Asias richest man it was certainly an eventful year for Adani Enterprises. Not to forget a mind boggling 345x PE valuation has also left many investors scratching their heads. LIC The public insurers listing on May 17 was the event of a lifetime. The governments 3. 5 percent stake sale in the 65yearold institution made it Indias biggest ever initial public offering IPO. It fetched close to Rs 21000 crore. The issue price was set at Rs 949 apiece. Retail investors lapped up the shares with their allotted quota subscribed 1. 99 times. It was the perfect recipe for a grand success but then the dreadful happened The stock listed 8 percent below its issue price at Rs 872. Fingers were pointed at the Reserve Bank of India. Investors said RBIs sudden interest rate hike soured the mood and caused the listing to be at a discount. For the meme world LIC was Baahubali RBI was Katappa. Since its listing the stock has gone only downwards. It is set to end the year near Rs 690 level. ITC No list is complete without the OG meme stock ITC. Since May 2019 investors had been waiting patiently to see the stock touch the Rs 300 mark again. And it finally happened in July 2022. Just like its many businesses cigarettes FMCG hotels paper agri the variety of memes was a sight to behold. From a turtle on a treadmill to a galloping bull ITC was likened to several animals. It is the secondbestperforming Nifty stock of the year with a 52 percent gain. If we go by what brokerages say the stock is all set to puff more gains in 2023. For instance Antique Stock Broking has a Rs 419 target on the stock.

The most iconic meme was one comparing Zomatos share price to the price of one kg of tomato. Currently it is trading way below its issue price of Rs 76. Zomato sure has an edge as it operates in a duopolistic market believe analysts. But its 570million acquisition of Blinkit resulting in greater cash burn has not gone down well with investors.

Let's just hope Godot shows up in this version, even if the delay is even a little longer. -Peden Doma Bhutia",https://skift.com/2023/01/05/oyos-ipo-could-be-delayed-as-indian-regulator-asks-for-updated-filing/,Skift Take The runup to an Oyo IPO is turning out to be a waitingforGodot moment. Lets just hope Godot shows up in this version even if the delay is even a little longer. The initial public offering of Indiabased budget hotel operator and aggregator Oyo may be further pushed back from its intended deadline of a launch within the first quarter this year. Indias capital markets regulatory body the Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI has now advised Oravel Stays the parent company of Oyo to refile the initial public offering draft papers with updates. The regulatory body on Tuesday said that it has returned Oyos draft red herring prospectus on December 30 asking the company to refile with applicable updates. While the details of the revision have not been specified the markets regulator has reportedly sought an update on risk factors key performance indicators outstanding litigations basis for valuation and other additional information from Oyo. Speaking to Skift in November a source close to the company had said that Softbankbacked Oyo planned to launch its initial public offering around the first quarter of 2023. Seeking a valuation of around 12 billion Oyo had filed preliminary documents in September 2021 planning to raise around 1. 16 billion through the initial public offering. A Fresh Look at Valuations The Securities and Exchange Board of India is looking closely at valuation of newage initial public offerings and there is evidence of mispricing or irrational exuberance given the postlisting price movement of companies such as One97 Zomato and others said a broker who had earlier interacted with the Oyo management while they were talking to investors post their first draft red herring prospectus filing. Also Oyos business may have undergone changes since the document was first filed in 2021 and there would be a need to have a fresh look at valuations on a back of a fresh filing he said. In September last year Oyos dipped value stood at around 6. 5 billion in the private market after SoftBank Group cut its valuation by more than 20 percent. In June Fitch Ratings had also downgraded the rating of Oravel Stays over profit uncertainty from B to B. Updating its draft red herring prospectus with results for the first half of the 2023 financial year in November Oyo had reported that its adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for the second quarter grew eight times from 860000 in the first quarter to 7 million primarily driven by a 23 percent quarteronquarter rise in gross booking value per hotel. Timeline Dependent on Oyo It is possible that the Securities and Exchange Board of India may not be satisfied with the clarifications to the addendum to the draft red herring prospectus filed by Oyo last year in September said a market observer. The various complaints against Oyo also dont seem to be working in the companys favor according to him. When asked about how delayed the initial public offering may be the observer said The ball is back in Oyos court whether they choose to serve or not is up to them and their investors. Only after they refile the draft red herring prospectus will the timelines of SEBI apply. Busiest Day of The Year for Oyo Meanwhile Oyo reported over 450000 on New Years Eve which the company said was 35 percent more than last year and is also the highest bookings per hotel per day for India in the last five years. In a series of tweets last week Ritesh Agarwal founder and group CEO of Oyo spoke about the busiest day of the year for the travel technology company. My team just informed me that over 750 cities have seen a 50 percent jump in bookings compared to last year. Breaking our own records by the minute Agarwal mentioned in a tweet. Oyo witnessed a major uptick in travel and tourism in 2022 and while leisure destinations may have led the global travel recovery curve in India business and cultural travel have significantly contributed to the sector according to the hotel aggregator.

After Jefferies moved Zomato out of the India model portfolio in favour of metals its Global Head of Equity Strategy also made some changes. In the India longonly equity portfolio Chris Wood added REC Limited formerly Rural Electrification Corporation with a 4 percent weighting. He did this by shaving investments in HDFC Bank Bajaj Finance ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and ICICI Lombard General Insurance by one percentage point each. Apart from the names mentioned above the India long only portfolio holds ICICI Bank SBI CAMS Reliance Industries ONGC Godrej Properties Century Textiles DLF Macrotech Developers Maruti Suzuki LT Adani Ports and Concor. Besides Woods also cut exposure to Bajaj Finance in the Asia exJapan longonly portfolio. With this step the total allocation to Indian equities came down to 36 percent from 37 percent. India still remains the biggest allocation in the portfolio. Bajaj Finance has been under selling pressure recently. Other analysts too have trimmed their outlook for the stock. Japanese equities to become attractive Earlier this week the Bank of Japan BoJ said it would allow fluctuations of the yield on the 10year benchmark Japanese government bond JGB in a wider range of 0. 50 percent instead of the current 0. 25 percent. The market is reading the move as the first step towards normalisation. Wood writing in his weekly newsletter Greed Fear said this step will likely make Japanese equities more attractive. Money managers may also have to tweak their allocation accordingly. From a stock market standpoint all of the above makes it ever more likely that Japan is exiting a deflationary era which means that sooner rather than later domestic institutions should in theory at least start to think about reallocating out of yen fixed income into Japanese equities said Wood. This is something they have not done since the Bubble burst in 1990. Also read MC Explains What does BoJs tweak in yield curve control policy mean According to him such an allocation from fixed income to equities should have happened long ago given that Topix has already outperformed the 10year Japanese GSec by 195 percent on a total return basis since November 2012. In GREED fears view foreigners should be adding to Japan. From a valuation perspective Japan looks attractive most particularly from a foreign investors standpoint with the yen until recently at its cheapest level in real effective exchange rate terms since June 1969 he said.,2022-12-22T12:47:32Z,No Headline,Extremely Negative,200.0,unexpected,-,"Sriharsha, Majety, Joey"

S. based technology firms two sources with direct knowledge said. The planned fund raising which one of the sources said will close within two months is an indication that investors may be starting to get more comfortable with Indian technology company valuations after the poor market performance in 2022 of some highflying startups and amid a global tech sector rout. It would also expand the pool of funds available to startups at a time when fundraising by Indian startups fell by a third last year to 24 billion Venture Intelligence data showed. Founded in 2006 Nexus was one of the first Indian venture capital firms to invest in U. S. and Indiabased software startups. The new fund will be its seventh so far and take the firms assets under management to more than 2 billion. Some of Nexus existing investors include global pension funds billionaire family offices and endowment funds. The new fund has received a strong response from endowments one of the sources said without sharing names of any specific investors. Nexus will invest the new funds which will be the biggest raised in India after Sequoias 2. 85 billion fund in mid2022 in early stage funding rounds of Indian internet and technology startups as well as U. S. based software firms the sources said. Nexus believes investing in U. S. software firms will help it hedge its bets and provide more stability than highprofile Indian startups which often burn billions of dollars in growth phase to achieve fast growth and attract users they added. And Nexus is betting that India where internet and mobile phone usage is rising rapidly will remain a longterm attractive bet for investors of its new fund one of the sources said. Mumbaibased Nexus did not respond to a request for comment. The sources declined to be named as the discussions are private. Investors have turned cautious about lofty valuations amid a global tech rout Indias digital services companies Paytm and Zomato have plunged after making their market debuts in 2021. Nexus current bets include Indian logistics firm Delhivery online education firm Unacademy and U. S. based software companies PubMatic Inc and Postman all of which clocked multibilliondollar valuations in recent years. Nexus was cofounded by Naren Gupta who ran a software company in the United States for 15 years before selling it to Intel. Gupta one of Indias most renowned venture capitalists died in 2021. Another cofounder Sandeep Singhal left the firm in 2021 while the third cofounder former eBay India and PayPal executive Suvir Sujan is one of the current managing directors.,2023-01-04T08:37:51Z,No Headline,Extremely Negative,590.0,"CRUDE, CRUDE, Rumors, risks, Dump, Volatility, resistance, volatile, Limited, LIMITED, Delayed, losses, resigned, LIMITED, losses, weak, fears, weak, fears, weak, fears, Limited, Resignation, LIMITED, LIMITED, LIMITED, Bearish, LIMITED, LIMITED",Slave,"lawsuit, Gunjan, Patidar, Gunjan, Patidar, Navamya, Ganesh, Acharya, Patidar, Gunjan, Patidar, Gunjan, Patidar, Deepinder, Goyal, Akshant, Goyal, Kaushik, Dutta, Sandhya, Sethia, Aparna, Popat, lawsuit"

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Sah Polymers will likely to be the last initial public offering IPO of 2022. The public issue is set to open on Friday December 30. The year 2022 is ending on a sombre note for IPO investors. Three companies that completed their fundraising in the first half of December have dropped below their issue price on the first trading day. The companiesAbans Holdings Sula Vineyards Landmark Carssaw muted response from investors receiving bids in the range of 13 times the shares offered. IPOs of KFin Technologies and Elin Electronics are set to list this week. Gauging poor market conditions companies have curtailed fundraising activity in 2022. The total money raised through IPOs in 2022 is way below the previous years levels as this Moneycontrol report explains. About Rs 61000 crore is estimated to be raised through IPOs this year lower than Rs 1. 2 lakh crore companies raised in 2021. Even so IPO investors may have lesser reasons to complain this year versus 2021. As of December 18 only 32 percent of the companies that have raised funds this year are trading at a discount to the issue price. Comparatively about 40 percent of the companies that have raised funds through IPOs in 2021 are trading below their issue prices shows an analysis by Bank of Baroda Research. The reasons are not hard to explain. The year 2021 saw public issues from new age companies such as One 97 Communications Paytm PB Fintech Zomato whose stocks dropped sharply in market selloff. Several ecommerce and fintech companies are in scaleup stage and are losing money. This year also has its share of disappointments with shares of companies such as Life Insurance Corporation of India LIC and Delhivery falling way below their IPO rates. Barring LIC and Delhivery most large IPOs with issue size of more than Rs 1000 crore are yielding positive returns for IPO investors this year points out Bank of Baroda Research. That said investors should read the abovementioned trends in conjunction with unfavourable market conditions. Fewer companies have raised funds through IPOs this year visvis 2021. This has skewed the overall issuances in 2022 towards large IPOs from insurance LIC edible oil Patanjali Foods Adani Wilmar and healthcare service sectors. Still the IPO pipeline remains healthy. An estimated 5055 companies have received regulatory clearances for their IPOs. These companies are from broad range of sector and should provide better choice for IPO investors in the year 2023. Investors will be hoping for a better showing in 2023 once the macro clouds part and a combination of sensible pricing and quality of issues could help realise that hope.

The BSE Sensex rallied 327 points to 61168 while the Nifty50 jumped 92 points to 18197 and formed a bullish candle on the daily charts indicating a positive mood. The mood in broader markets too was positive as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 0. 88 percent and 0. 7 percent respectively on positive breadth. About two shares advanced for every falling share on the NSE. A reasonable positive candle was formed on the daily chart which has placed beside the long negative candle of Friday. This signals the minor strength of bulls to come back from the lows. A decisive move above 18265 levels could negate the bearish pattern of Dark Cloud Cover formed last Friday Nagaraj Shetti Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said. The Nifty is continuously tagging the hurdle of down sloping trend line over the last 45 sessions. After the downside breakout of the said trend line on December 23 the Nifty failed to show any decisive followthrough weakness since then. This could raise some hopes for bulls to make a comeback he feels. Hence the market expert said a sustainable move above 1826518300 levels could pull the Nifty towards another hurdle of 18500 levels in a quick period of time. Immediate support is placed at the 18080 level.

On the daily chart the rally stopped at the 50EMA. As long as it remains above 18070 the trend appears to be positive. On the higher end the index may move up towards 18350. Support on the lower end is placed at 1807017950. Kunal Shah Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities The Bank Nifty index witnessed buying from the lower level and the bulls managed to hold the support of 42400. The index on the upside immediately faces a hurdle at 43000 where the highest open interest is built up on the call side. The index remains in a buyondip mode and might continue to trade in the broad range of 4200043000. The index on a sustainable move above 43000 will witness a sharp short covering towards the 44000 mark. Ajit Mishra VP Technical Research Religare Broking Markets gained over half a percent in a range bound session tracking firm global cues. After the initial uptick the Nifty surrendered all the gains in no time however buying in select index majors pushed the index to the days high again as the day progressed. Consequently it settled at 18123 levels up by 0. 6. Most sectors participated in the move wherein metal outshined the others as it gained over 4. Besides further recovery in the broader indices eased the pressure. Recovery in the global indices especially in the US is offering the respite in absence of any major domestic trigger. The recent buoyancy in the banking pack combined with a recovery in the select index majors is encouraging however Nifty has multiple hurdles to cross before resuming the uptrend. We thus reiterate our view to focus on stockspecific opportunities and maintaining positions on both sides. Vinod Nair Head of Research at Geojit Financial With strong support from global peers the domestic market is attempting to recoup its previous weeks losses. Metal stocks shone amid hopes of a demand revival in China on reports of loosening COVID restrictions. This along with fears over supply disruptions from winter storms in the US resulted in oil prices rising. Shrikant Chouhan Head of Equity Research Retail Kotak Securities Market is driving some comfort from the absence of any negative news from the global front. Valuations are slightly looking better after the recent spate of corrections hence investors are resorting to value buying in the run up to the current month FO expiry. Technically after a promising reversal formation the market held the uptrend formation throughout the day. The higher bottom intraday formation is indicating the continuation of a pullback rally in the near future. For the trend following traders 18000 would act as a sacrosanct support level above which the index could move up to a 50day SMA Simple Moving Average or 18220. In case of any further upside the index could move up to 18300. Dilip Parmar Research Analyst HDFC Securities Monthend dollar demand from oil importers and yearend rebalancing foreign fund outflows weighed on the Indian rupee in todays trade as it surrendered Mondays gain. The surge in crude and precious metal prices also weighed on the local unit. Broadly speaking the rupee has been stuck in the range of 82. 40 to 82. 90 lacking the directional move ahead of yearend. In the near term the rupee is expected to trade between 82. 40 to 82. 90 against the dollar. The bias for the local currency remains weak as long as it trades below 82. 40. Rupee Close Indian rupee closed 21 paise lower at 82. 86 per dollar against previous close of 82. 65. Market Close Benchmark indices ended higher on December 27 with Nifty above 18100 amid buying across the sectors barring FMCG.

However losers included HUL Apollo Hospitals Nestle India ITC and NTPC. Except FMCG all other sectoral indices ended in the green. The BSE midcap index rose 0. 8 percent and smallcap index added 1. 4 percent. Radiant Cash Management Services IPO bought 35 till final day The public issue of Radiant Cash Management Services continued to see muted response from the launch.

These are some of the words that analysts are throwing up to project earnings for IT service providers for the quarter ended December 2022. The trend highlights the start of perhaps a long winter for them. IT companies which generate most of their revenues from export of services are likely to be impacted due to recessionary pressure in the US their biggest market and other western nations. We see potential for negative surprises across the board on revenue led by higher furloughs and pressure on the existing book of business said Nitin Padmanabhan an analyst at Investec Securities. Earnings commentary from Accenture last month was foreboding. IT companies have also reduced their expectations themselves. However there are some hopes that top names may maintain their growth guidance. Revenue stagnation IT companies have just come through their golden period as the increased tech adoption during pandemic led to a rapid revenue growth. Though things are not looking up from here they are also not looking down. We expect muted revenue growth of 03 percent quarter on quarter for our coverage universe said Kawaljeet Saluja an analyst at Kotak Institutional Equities. Revenue growth will moderate to highsingle digits to lowteens on YoY comparison. Also read Accenture secondquarter forecast disappoints as IT spending weakens Saluja said the EBIT margin of IT firms that was contracting for a few quarters now will likely improve albeit moderately. TCS and HCL Tech should report relatively better quarter while Tech Mahindra and Mphasis should lag he added. Dipesh Mehta of Emkay Global echoed the observation. We expect the revenue growth momentum to moderate in Q3 on account of furloughs lower number of working days deferred spending by few clients and increased cautiousness among clients amid macro uncertainties and high inflationary environment he said. Mehta expects constant currency revenue growth of 0. 8 percent to 3. 7 percent for TierI companies with crosscurrency impact of 2050 bps on reported USD revenue and of negative 0. 4 percent to positive 3. 4 percent for midcap firms with crosscurrency impact of 1030 bps on reported USD revenue. Investors should note that the flat revenue growth is coming at a high base. Meaning they will still be growing although at a slower pace. Deal wins Unexciting Deal wins which reached record highs earlier last year could be in line with historical trends in most cases said Padmanabhan but highlighted that these are deals that have been in the making since Q1FY23. From Q4FY23 lower deal flow could be seen as clients trim their spending. Kotak also said it expects steady but unexciting deal win numbers from IT companies. Many companies have announced a few interesting deals in the three months with TCS leading the pack. We believe TCS could report TCV total contract value of 910 billion. We expect 2. 5 billion of TCV from Infosys and HCL Tech said Saluja. TCV growth for the sector moderated in the last four quarters though that failed to impact growth since many deals were discretionary shortcycle programs. Stock talks The market has already reflected some of the lower projections on earnings. However lowlevel buying in some names has kept it afloat so far. In the last one year the Nifty IT index has delivered merely 2 percent returns. Among the biggest names Tata Consultancy Services TCS has seen a drawdown of 15 percent in the last year. In the same period Infosys is down 21 percent HCL Tech 22 percent and Wipro 46 percent. The risk for IT services stocks is continued revenue weakness in H2FY23 followed by a tepid start to FY24 said Padmanabhan. This could bring down TierI growth expectations to 67 percent vs 8 percent currently leading to a potential contraction in PE multiples. The selloff in some names have made them attractive. However all investors are not rushing to buy as they wait and watch the development. We expect investors to focus on growthdecline in IT budgets for CY2023 the state of demand and the pace of decision making. Infosys HCL Tech and Mphasis are our top picks said Saluja. Emkay said its pecking order is Wipro Infosys Tech Mahindra HCL Tech and TCS among TierI players and Zomato Mphasis Birlasoft Firstsource Solutions and Persistent Systems among midcaps.

,"Zomato, Paytm, And Nykaa: Here's How The Stocks Could Fare",What is the right course of action in these stocks?,https://www.equitymaster.com/detail.asp?date=01/04/2023&story=3&title=Zomato-Paytm-and-Nykaa-Buy-Avoid-Hold-or-Sell,If I ask you to name three stocks that come to mind when I say newage tech stocks chances are good that we would be talking about the three stocks mentioned in the title. In fact these stocks have become synonymous with fast growth and IPOs at sky high valuations. Investors didnt really care about profits of these firms. As long as the story was hot they were confident of making profits on their investments. Besides one of these firms Nykaa was already profitable at the time of its IPO. All three firms had great longterm growth stories... and investors loved them. All three had solid listings when they hit the primary market with their IPOs. It seemed nothing could go wrong. But then it did. As I write this FSN Ecommerce Nykaa is down 77 from its listing price despite a massive 51 bonus issue to stem the decline. Zomato is down a little over 50 from its listing price. And Paytm is down about 65 from its listing price. By the way their fall from the top is even worse. Heres a table of the returns of these tech stocks from the time they hit the market. The wealth destruction in these stocks has been massive. Most investors who didnt sell are sitting on huge losses. So all this begs a couple of obvious questions... Are these stocks a buy or an avoid for those who dont have them in their portfolios Are these stocks a sell or a hold for those who have them in their portfolios These are very difficult questions to answer. But in this editorial we will consider Zomato Paytm and Nykaa and look at the current situation of these stocks. Then you the reader can take a call. Despite the massive crash there are still people who are bullish on the stock. Recently it bounced about 50 from its alltime low. But clearly the trend is still down... unless a significant amount of buying comes in to prop up the stock and prevent it from falling below its alltime low. Our view on Zomato was summed up nicely by analyst Aditya Vora... Aditya also did a video on the stock Time to Buy Zomato Now the fundamentals of the company have been improving. Its not all bad for the stock. So heres what we can say about Zomato... If you dont have the stock in your portfolio you will need to decide if the fall in the stock is sufficient to take a longterm call. In other words does it offer sufficient margin of safety or not You will also have to be comfortable with the idea that the stock could fall further. After all its still a lossmarking company. So in the case of a decline in the overall market this stock could fall below its alltime low. Are you comfortable with that Now if you are holding the stock then your action will depend on your purchase price. Are you sitting on a huge paper loss If so consider prospect that along with improving fundamentals of the company the stock could go up over time. That would cut your loss but it will take time. If your loss is minor or if you are in the green having bought it near the recent low then your action would depend on the reason you bought the stock. Was it to speculate on the price Or was it a long term investment If you bought it for speculation then you will need to have a clear exit price in mind. If you have recently bought it as a long term investment then you will need to closely track the improving fundamentals of the company and also regularly assess the story. Is it playing out to your satisfaction Now that we have covered the various potential buy avoid hold and sell scenarios for Zomato lets consider Paytm and Nykaa too. Before LIC there was Paytm. It was Indias biggest IPO when it hit the market in November 2021. The hype was massive. The stock market sentiment was strongly positive back then. The Rs 183 billion Rs 18300 crore IPO received bids for over 91. 4 m shares against the total issue size of nearly 48. 4 m shares. The retail category was subscribed 1. 66 times. The journey since has not been pleasant as the stock has been on a oneway decline. Weve seen just how damaging the selling can be once the postlisting lockin period ends for preIPO investors. The stock has been hit by large block deals involving these preIPO investors. There doesnt seem to be any respite as the company is still far away from stopping its cash burn or turning nominally profitable. So what do we do in this case Well the situation is a little different compared to Zomato. Apart from its size and brand name Paytm doesnt seem to have any serious competitive advantage i. e. moat to speak of. In its payments business for example there is no impediment for a user to switch from using Paytm to Google Pay... or any other service. Thus if you dont have the stock in your portfolio then it makes sense to track the fundamentals closely and invest only after you are sufficiently convinced the company is not only on the path to profitable growth and positive cash flow but also has a strong long term competitive advantage. On the other hand if you are holding the stock the situation is similar to that of Zomato. What was the reason you bought the stock in the first place The answer will decide your next course of action in the stock. Now this is a profitable company... and this one fact separates it from the others. It can be valued by traditional metrics like PE and PB. We dont need to worry about cash burn as the company has mostly overcome this challenge. Also it does seem to have a competitive advantage i. e. moat. Its brand is synonymous with womens beauty wellness and fashion. Also the sheer scale of products it offers across many price points has made it a compelling and highly convenient online marketplace for women. Its premium retail store strategy also seems to be moving in the right direction. This is a company that does have a viable brand that its customers keep coming back to. This should provide it with at least some pricing power in the long term. Unfortunately none of this matters right now due to the stocks valuations. Its PE of nearly 200 offers zero margin of safety. This is a stock in which the PB of 50 would be preferable if it was the PE. Thats how expensive it is. Now that doesnt mean the stock cant go up... but if it does then the PE will increase even further. Equitymasters cohead of research Tanushree Banerjee did a video on the stock Is Nykaa a Falling Knife So what is to be done with Nykaa If you dont have the stock in your portfolio you need to seriously ask yourself if youre comfortable buying without a margin of safety. This is the kind of stock that can fall even if the fundamentals improve just because its valuations are too high. Ask yourself what the highest PE is that you are willing to pay for this stock and how much the stock needs to fall for the PE will get to that level. If you have the stock in your portfolio we believe you will need to take a good hard relook at the reasons why you bought it. We understand that selling at a loss is painful... but you will have to take a call on holding without a margin of safety. In that case you are essentially hoping for a massive rise in the companys net profit which would justify the high PE. Please note this editorial does not provide any recommendation i. e. buy avoid hold or sell view on any of these stocks. The idea was to shed light on how investors need to think when faced with a scenario of taking action on a stock that has fallen a lot. We hope this editorial has provided some insight into the thought process needed to buy avoid hold or sell these three stocks.

His channel is full of daily vlogs and occasional standup videos. Kapoor is usually the one cracking oneliners. But when it comes to promoting Mamaearths products he becomes the butt of jokes. How can you promote a hair oil product when you yourself are losing hair thats one of the sanitised comments. Kapoor and other influencers have promoted Mamaearth products extensively since the company was incorporated in 2016. For the average YouTube viewer the sheer number of ads of the thenfledgling brand would easily have got on ones nerves. Mamaearth is the flagship brand of Honasa Consumer a beauty and personal care company that plans to come out with an initial public offering. The company filed its draft IPO papers on December 30. Also Read Mamaearth parent files IPO papers Sofina Stellaris Kunal Bahl Shilpa Shetty to sell stake The amount spent on advertising and influencer marketing stands out in the companys draft red herring prospectus. As of September 30 2022 the company worked with 3958 influencers. In FY22 it spent about Rs 391 crore on advertising against net sales of Rs 932 crore thats 40 percent of revenue spent on marketing. The quantum was similar for FY21 FY20 and the sixmonth period ended September 2022. This is way too high tweeted Aditya Kondawar of Complete Circle Capital. Experts term this number high because the return on ad spend ROAS has not improved from 2. 6 over the past three years. ROAS is a metric that measures the amount of revenue earned for every rupee spent on advertising. For Mamaearth ROAS has ranged from 2. 4 to 2. 6 since FY20. The more repeat customers a brand has the less has to be spent on advertising and marketing. Since Mamaearths ROAS has not improved it indicates few repeat customers said experts. In contrast Nykaas FY22 ROAS stood at 7. 8 and big boy Hindustan Unilevers at 10. 6. Valuation makes little sense The exorbitant ad spend takes a backseat when one looks at the valuation. The company plans to raise as much as Rs 400 crore through a fresh issue of shares apart from an offer for sale of about 46. 8 million shares. The company became a unicorn in January 2022 with a valuation of 1. 2 billion. Mamaearth is said to be looking at a target market capitalisation of 3 billion about Rs 24000 crore with the size of its IPO. The company reported a net profit of Rs 14 crore in FY22. That works out to a pricetoearnings ratio of about 1714x. Ridiculous disastrous and extortion these are some of the words that have been used on social media to describe the valuation demand. Many investors have taken to Twitter to declare they will keep away from this IPO. Moneycontrols email to the company and book running lead managers to confirm the valuation number has not received any response yet. The company reported a net loss of Rs 1332 crore in FY21 and Rs 428 crore in FY20 as per the draft prospectus. Initially when newage companies came out with IPOs there was an element of fascination due to the hype created. For investors that fancy preceded valuations in 2021 as everybody wanted a pie said Ambareesh Baliga an independent market analyst. Things have changed now. Baliga compares Mamaearth with Nykaa both are directtoconsumer companies in the beauty and personal care space. Nykaa gave good returns initially but its profits have not moved in the last four quarters. Investors have now realised that cashflow and growth in the bottom line are key to watch so they will not make the same mistake twice he added. Newage tech stocks including Nykaa Paytm and Zomato have all declined more than 50 percent since listing. Also Read Mamaearth IPO Five key highlights from its DRHP Risks galore Honasa gets a chunk of its revenue from a limited number of products and it has flagged this as a key risk in its draft prospectus. Sales of its top 10 products contributed 38. 4 percent 30. 38 percent and 30. 17 percent to its overall revenue in FY20 FY21 and FY22 respectively. Any decrease in the sales of such products will adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows the company said. The manufacturing of all products is outsourced to thirdparty producers primarily under nonexclusive contract arrangements. We do not own any manufacturing facilities Honasa said. The company plans to spend the bulk of the IPO proceeds on advertising on setting up exclusive brand outlets and on investing in subsidiary Bhabani Blunt Hairdressing BBlunt. Investing in a manufacturing facility is not in the plan as of now.

Sixty percent of the companys sales come from thirdparty ecommerce marketplaces including Amazon Flipkart and Nykaa. Marketplaces discount the selling expenses of such brands and artificially give them sales boost Kush Agarwal a businessman and angel investor said on Twitter. These factors make little sense to those who have followed the first season of Shark Tank India. Mamaearths cofounder Ghazal Alagh would often refuse to invest in a startup citing high valuation or growth concerns. Netizens have pointed out that she is at the receiving end now. I wouldnt be surprised if they cut the offer size or withdraw the public issue completely Baliga said.,2023-01-04T03:40:59Z,"Zomato co-founder and CTO, Gunjan Patidar, resigns ",Extremely Negative,220.0,"resignation, resigned, Limited",-,"Gunjan, Patidar, Gunjan, Patidar, Mohit, Gupta, Gupta, Rahul, Ganjoo, Siddharth, Jhawar, Gaurav, Gupta"

I believe that the issue was undersubscribed and you would get some good opportunity when the IPO gets listed. I believe that Landmark is a very strong business having tremendous moats and it is the only organised play in the car distribution and dealership business.

It was however a case of simple leverageIPO financing. While I invested Rs 5 crore from my pocket Kotak Wealth got me financing for Rs 95 crore at an interest rate of 10 per cent annualized for a week the period for which IPO funds get blocked. This cost of Rs 20 lakh as interest was an additional cost for acquiring the shares Grover said in the book published by Penguin. With the IPO being oversubscribed more than thirty times he got an allotment of shares worth over Rs 3 crore. On 23 July 2021 when the newage stock debuted on exchanges at Rs 115 per share against the issue price of Rs 76 per share he sent a mandate to his wealth managers to sell all his shares. By the time the trade got executed I got a selling price of Rs 136 per share. With my landing cost after interest being between Rs 8285 I ended up making over Rs 2. 25 crore said the poster boy of startup India. The IIMAhmedabad and IITDelhi graduate explains he was bullish on Zomato IPO on several counts. Of course I knew of Deepinder and I am a big believer in his ability to persevere and keep building big. Fundamentally with the pandemic the ticket size of their orders had grown as people were ordering food from home for 34 members in the family as against single rolls in office thereby increasing Zomatos absolute margins said the entrepreneur and investor. Moreover he said with restaurants completely dependent during lockdowns on app orders there was no risk of the take rate coming down. On the other hand job insecurity among delivery boys kept delivery costs in check. In fact Covid magically solved the food delivery economics in the country overnight just like it skyrocketed UPI penetration he said. After success in Zomato greed got the better of him as he went in for Car Trade IPO but ended up losing Rs 25 lakh there. In the book he makes it clear that creating a stock market public equity portfolio is not his cup of tea. I have been certain that if you hedge your bets you get mediocre returns. What excites me is putting money behind highrisk earlystage founders he wrote.

More importantly there is data available about their business models. Initial public offerings of Indian internet firms boomed in 2021 thanks to pandemictriggered easymoney policy and government efforts to foster startups. The stocks were hit last year by caution over fundamentals and governance magnified by the impact of the global tech selloff amid Federal Reserve policy tightening. Radhakrishnan noted that some new tech firms have begun to show signs that they can generate profits supported by firstmover advantages and big market shares. Funds managed by Franklin Templeton bought at least 3. 3 million shares of ecommerce logistics provider Delhivery Ltd. and more than 2 million shares of PB Fintech Ltd. the operator of online insurance marketplace Policybazaar in November according to data compiled by Bloomberg. We didnt participate in these IPOs except Zomato but now we see a lot more transparency a lot more discussions with management are happening said Radhakrishnan who overseas assets valued at 7 billion. The firm whose 1. 3 billion India Flexi Cap Fund has outperformed 86 of its peers over the last three years recognizes the disruptive nature of some of these businesses and their mediumtolonger term ability to make money he said.

A fivemember constitution bench headed by justice Abdul Nazeer found no flaws in the decisionmaking processin a 41 ruling. The government was empowered to take the decision and due process was followed the top court said. The court which declined to be drawn into ruling on the economic merits of the policy citing its lack of expertise said enough time was given to people to exchange the currency. Why its important In her dissenting judgement justice BV Nagarathna said the move was unlawful and should have been preceded by a parliamentary debate. The majority judgement however said demonetization satisfied the test of proportionality. Stock markets ring in new year with rising indices in first trading session Indian gauges logged gains on the first trading day of 2023 riding on a combination of buying in index majors steady European markets and a boost in sentiment after the release of macroeconomic data. Both the indices clocked nearly 0. 5 per cent gains with the Sensex rising 327 points to end the session at 61168 while the 50share Nifty ended at 18197 a gain of 92 points. Why its important Both the indices have ended with gains in the first session of each year since 2019. Stocks typically rise during the last five and first two sessions of a calendar year. Manufacturing activity in India rises to a 26month high signaling resilient demand Indias manufacturing activity rebounded to a 26month high in December led by strong expansion in new orders and production according to the SP Global India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index. As production increased hiring also picked up and factory output grew at its fastest rate since November 2021. Manufacturing PMI rose sharply to 57. 8 in December from 55. 7 in November. However new overseas orders rose at the slowest pace in five months amid a demand slowdown in key export markets. Why its important Business outlook and confidence have improved as input costs pressures have eased. The increased activity also indicates resilient demand despite global challenges. Government to deliberate merits of letting large defaulters continue holding reins The central government will examine recommendations to let shareholders of large defaulters retain control of the businesses while exploring fresh investments and corporate restructuring with its lenders outside bankruptcy tribunals. The insolvency law committee of the corporate affairs ministry will examine this proposal in detail. The proposal to let the existing management retain control contrasts the original bankruptcy code structure of creditors taking control after the admission of the bankruptcy petition. Why its important If the new suggestions are accepted it will mark a major shift from the current practice of shareholders of defaulting companies ceding management control to an administrator appointed by a committee of creditors. Technology firms slow down hiring in face of impending economic recession in the West Indias technology companies are sharply reducing their hiring mandates with industry estimates pointing to a nearly 90 per cent drop in December from a peak of over 110000 monthly active openings a year ago.

We are going to launch it for a limited user base as of now and then gradually plan to scale it up says Prahlad Krishnamurthi chief business officer Cleartrip. The applicants credit worthiness and the customer base with which we initiate our launch will be evaluated by the fintechs we have partnered with. As the name suggests travel now pay later TNPL is about making dream travel possible by availing a quick loan. It is the travel version of buy now pay later BNPL schemes that customers have grown accustomed to in retail. TNPL is essentially a loan or credit that you take out when booking or taking a trip and pay for it in installments. You can either pay partially or not at all while booking and do so later within a specified duration. You can avail of nocost EMIs or pay an interest rate on the borrowed amount depending on the quantum of funds borrowed and the duration for which you are taking the loan. Consumers switching to Buy Now Pay Later Indian consumers are spoilt for choice when it comes to putting off paying for their purchases. As if credit cards and equal equated installments werent enough over the last three years many fintech firms have come up with the BNPL feature. The onset of the COVID19 pandemic in 2020 further nudged many consumers to switch to BNPL schemes. According to a report by GlobalData a data analysis firm the transaction value of BNPL services is estimated to increase at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 32. 5 percent between 2022 and 2026 to reach INR1. 1 trillion 15 billion in four years. Buy Now Pay Later for millennials According to a ZestMoney report on Indian consumers opting for BNPL solutions in 2020 the average age of consumers who opt for BNPL is 34 years. As per its 2020 report consumers who availed this facility typically spend on online education purchasing of highend smartphones electronic appliances fashion and travel. Shivani Gupta senior banking and payments analyst at GlobalData says BNPL which is already very popular in Australia and many European markets is gradually gaining traction in India especially among millennials. It provides consumers with the flexibility to pay for purchases at later dates with nointerest making it a lucrative payment tool particularly for those who do not own credit cards. Further with pandemic adversely affecting consumers disposable income the demand for shortterm consumer financing solutions has increased in the past couple of years. Even though the target market for these providers are millennials these early earners should not give into impulse spending and rather still plan their finances well says Kalpesh Ashar a SEBIregistered investment adviser. How does BNPL work To put it simply the buynowpaylater scheme allows you to buy something now and then stagger your payments. A most basic form of BNPL is when you run a book with a fintech firm. Once you enroll with the firm it allows you to buy products from any of its partner merchants online stores within a certain time period say 1530 days and then allows you to settle all your bills at the end of the cycle. If you delay your payments beyond this cycle then it levies an interest cost depending on your bill amount. Some BNPL firms also allow you to convert your highcost purchases into nocost credit for three to six months. Some of the fintech firms in this segment are Amazon Pay ePayLater Kissht LazyPay Simpl Slice ZestMoney etc. The BNPL is also an option thats available with ecommerce websites like Flipkart Amazon BigBasket and so on and also on food delivery mobile applications like Zomato and Swiggy and even in trip booking portals such as Goibibo and Cleartrip. How do the BNPL charges work BNPL works as an alternative to your credit cards. For instance if you make purchases from within the Simpl app through its 2500 plus merchants your bill gets generated every 15 days. If you fail to clear your bill by the due date a late penalty of up to Rs 250 plus GST is levied. These charges might appear small but experts like Ashar says that if unchecked they can balloon into something big and unmanageable. Failure to repay your bills can not just lead to incurring charges as mentioned earlier it can also lead to a negative impact on your credit score. This is because by not paying your bills on time you display an inability to pay back what you owe and this can reduce your credit score. This can lead to difficulties in getting loan approvals in the future. There are no free lunches and anything that gives you instant gratification in the financial world is not healthy adds Ashar. So should you use TNPL The digital travel purchase pattern in India has transformed drastically since September 2020. A substantial number of people consume such services online these days. However when they do not have enough cash in hand they prefer routes like pay later or save now and travel later. Both these services are rapidly picking up pace in India. As with most payment methods its important to consider the pros and cons before deciding. If you find that a buytravel now pay later service is right for you then you will be able to save money while delaying payment for an item over a certain period of time. There are many buy now pay later options available so you can shop around to find the best one for your needs. BNPL can be a great option for those who have a long time before they have to make a large purchase are saving up for a big purchase or have a specific item on their wish list that theyd like to purchase but cannot finance immediately. Having said that do read the fine print to look for hidden charges andor conditions that could trigger higher interest rate or penalties.,2022-12-25T15:09:27Z,"'Khana mangoge, Langar denge': Sikh man wins heart with his take on Zomato-Blinkit campaign",Extremely Positive,20.0,"cold, twist, Limited",-,"Harteerath, Singh, Singh, Singh, Singh, Singhs, Singh, Singh, Kheer, mangoge, Doodh, mangoge"

,Over Rs 2 crore in 8 minutes! Here's how Ashneer Grover earned big via Zomato IPO,The former 'Shark Tank India' judge explained how he used leverage to earn big bucks in a matter of few minutes via Zomato IPO,https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate/story/over-rs-2-crore-in-8-minutes-heres-how-ashneer-grover-earned-big-via-zomato-ipo-357833-2022-12-26,BharatPes former MD Ashneer Grover earned a cool Rs 2. 25 crore within 8 minutes of Zomatos massive stock market listing last year. In his tellall memoir Doglapan The Hard Truth about Life and StartUps the former Shark Tank India judge explained how he used leverage to earn big bucks in matter of few minutes. It was however a case of simple leverageIPO financing. While I invested Rs 5 crore from my pocket Kotak Wealth got me financing for Rs 95 crore at an interest rate of 10 per cent annualised for a week the period for which IPO funds get blocked. This cost of Rs 20 lakh as interest was an additional cost for acquiring the shares Grover wrote in the book published by Penguin. Owing to oversubscription Grover got the food delivery platforms shares worth Rs 3 crore at the issue price of Rs 76 per share. The stock opened at Rs 116 in July 2021 and Grover exited the companys shares at Rs 136 apiece within 8 minutes of listing. By the time the trade got executed I got a selling price of Rs 136 per share. With my landing cost after interest being between Rs 8285 I ended up making over Rs 2. 25 crore Grover wrote in his book. However later in 2021 Grover faced backlash over his alleged spat with a Kotak Mahindra Banks official over nonallotment of Nykaas shares. An audio clip went viral on social media allegedly of the startup millionaire threatening to kill a Kotak bank employee for failing to get him the Nykaa IPO allocation. Ashneer Grover reacted to the viral audio clip claiming that it is fake. After the Zomato success Grover tried to replicate it with Car Trade IPO but ended up losing Rs 25 lakh.

The rating of 12 digital platforms was done by a Fairwork India team in association with the Oxford University. Fairwork evaluates the work conditions of digital labour platforms internationally. Fairwork India Ratings 2022 Report which assessed platforms against five principles Fair Pay Fair Conditions Fair Contracts Fair Management and Fair Representation found that Amazon Flex Dunzo Ola PharmEasy and Uber scored zero out of 10 points. This year no platform scored more than seven out of the maximum of ten points and none scored all the first points across the five principles the report said. The Fairwork India Ratings 2022 evaluated 12 platforms including Amazon Flex Big Basket Dunzo Flipkart Ola PharmEasy Porter Swiggy Uber Urban Company Zepto and Zomato. Each of the five principles is broken down into two points a first point and a second point that can only be awarded if the first point has been fulfilled. Every platform receives a score out of 10. Urban Company scored the most seven out of 10 followed by Big Basket 610 Flipkart 510 Swiggy 510 Zomato 410 Zepto 210 and Porter 110. In the eyes of the law gig workers are independent contractors which means they are not entitled to labour rights in a manner that unorganized workers or employees are. A starting point to improve their working condition would be to ensure that they receive at least the hourly minimum wage after considering workrelated costs and ensuring that the demands they make through collective action are heard acknowledged and considered by the platforms Professor Balaji Parthasarathy the Principal Investigator of the team told PTI. The Fairwork India Team was spearheaded by the Centre for IT and Public Policy CITAPP International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore IIITB in association with Oxford University. This report examines the work conditions of platform workers on digital labour platforms in India. It evaluates 12 platforms offering locationbased services in sectors such as domestic and personal care logistics food delivery epharmacy and transportation in India. Even with workers and worker groups repeatedly emphasising the importance of a stable income for platform workers platforms have been reluctant to publicly commit to and operationalise a minimumwage policy the report said. This year Big Basket Flipkart and Urban Company implemented and operationalised policies to ensure that all workers on these platforms earn at least the hourly local minimum wage after factoring in workrelated costs it added.

The report assessed several prominent businesses and scored them on the basis of how proactively they worked to create fair working conditions for the lowliest of their workers namely gig economy workers. The study which was conducted in partnership with the University of Oxford said the aforementioned firms failed to provide fair pay fair contracts fair management fair representation or fair working conditions to their gig workers getting a score of zero on 10. On the other hand firms such as Urban Company BigBasket and Flipkart did fairly well. The report gave Urban Company a score of seven out of 10 six to BigBasket five each to Flipkart and Swiggy four to Zomato two to grocery delivery firm Zepto and one to Tiger Globalbacked delivery firm Porter. In its annual report Fairwork India stated that This year only Bigbasket Flipkart and Urban Company were awarded the first point because of the public commitments they have made to paying workers at least the hourly local minimum wage after factoring in workrelated costs. Bigbasket and Urban Company have operationalised this by committing to reimburse the difference between workers earnings per hour and the hourly local minimum wage after costs. Flipkart and Urban Company have committed to basing their pricing structure for workers on the hourly local minimum wage after costs. Flipkart has also undertaken steps to hold its thirdparty service providers to the same commitment the report added. In recent years more and more people have been participating in parttime or gigbased work. Despite this there has been no effort by most companies relying on gig workers to extend the employee benefits that regular employees enjoy to gigeconomy workers. The benefits that gig workers are deprived of include some basics like health insurance. The promise of the flexibility of the digital platform economy raises as many questions about livelihoods as it offers opportunities. We hope the Fairwork report provides the basis for an interpretation of flexibility that allows for not merely the adaptability that platforms seek but also the income and social security that workers lack said Professors Balaji Parthasarathy and Janaki Srinivasan the principal investigators of the team in a statement.

,Yatra India IPO Approved; Yatra Also An Attractive Acquisition Target,SEBI approved DRHP filed by Yatra for listing its shares on Indian stock exchanges. Read more to see our thoughts on this IPO and how this could add value to the parent stock.,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568252-yatra-india-ipo-approved-attractive-acquisition-target,Yatra India IPO Approved Yatra Also An Attractive Acquisition Target Summary Yatra is a leading Online Travel Agency OTA in India. It is the largest OTA in corporate travel and the second largest in overall online travel. On November 19 SEBI approved the DRHP filed by Yatra for listing its shares on the Indian stock exchanges. Indian conglomerates such as Adani and Tata are launching super apps in which travel is a key element and they are looking for acquisitions. As one of the most recognizable and trusted brands in the travel space Yatra Online is expected to do well in IPO. It is also an attractive acquisition target. With a successful listing Yatra shares will rise due to higher valuation in India. However with an acquisition the shares could rise even further. Yatra Online NASDAQYTRA filed the DRHP documents in March 22 for the IPO of its subsidiary in India. After more than seven months of waiting the DRHP was finally approved by SEBI on November 19th to move forward with the IPO. This is a massive deal for Yatra whose shares have been languishing on the Nasdaq stock exchange where it does not have the name recognition it has in India. The Indian stock market has been doing very well compared to the rest of the world. While Yatra is unknown in the US it is a wellknown and trusted brand in India. A successful IPO of the Indian subsidiary will substantially impact the share price of the parent Yatra Online shares since the parent Yatra will own most of the shares of the Indian subsidiary. As Yatra gets ready for the listing with roadshow promotions among the investors there is an exciting window of opportunity when it could be acquired. This is because travel has become a significant component of attraction for the giant conglomerates that are rushing to build super apps. Yatra is one of the few pure plays that will be reasonably priced even with IPO pricing. Such an acquisition could result in a much higher value for the parent Yatra Online shares than even with an IPO. Ascending Indian Stock Market As the world recovers from the pandemic while the economies of the US Europe and China are struggling to recover the Indian economy is poised to grow quickly. With a large and young population Indias economy is somewhat selfreliant. All the ingredients are in place for it to grow despite the gloomy global outlook. While the global stock markets have dropped the Indian stock market remains strong reflecting the economys strength. One of the reasons for the strong performance of the Indian stock market is the increased participation of retail investors. Millions of Indians entered the stock market during the pandemic. Investing through mutual funds and other institutions is also on the increase. As the Fed raised the rates foreign investors started moving away from the Indian stock markets. However the retail investors and the Indian institutional investors have stepped in and have held the market steady. India IPO could be hugely beneficial for Yatra stock Some technology stocks such as Paytm and Zomato which recently went IPO have not done well. This is mainly because these are lossmaking entities with no clear timeframe on when they will be making a profit. Promising technology companies such as EaseMyTrip a peer of Yatra have done exceptionally well. Very few pure travel tech companies are trading on the Indian stock exchange and there is a hunger for such companies among Indian investors and institutions. EaseMyTrip went IPO in early 2021 at around a 200M market cap. Now it is trading at a market cap of over 1B Yatras revenue is comparable to that of EaseMyTrip. However EaseMyTrip is much more profitable than Yatra. EaseMyTrip is notoriously lean on operations. While Yatra has more of a standard travel tech company structure. Yatra cut its workforce by half during the pandemic and focused on automation. While it is adding resources as the revenue is coming back due to automation and more focus on corporate travel the resource requirements will be much lower than before. This will likely help Yatra to be profitable in 2023. Yatra is planning to raise Rs7500 crores from the IPO from fresh issue of shares and it is also planning to sell about 9M Offer For Sale OFS shares. Now that the IPO is approved Yatra will go through roadshows and determine the pricing for the shares. Typically companies offer up to 20 of their shares for IPO. Going by that trend Yatra will likely target a valuation of Rs37500 crores about 450M. The proceeds from the fresh shares will all go to the Indian subsidiary and the proceeds from the OFS which is expected to be around 40M will likely go to the parent. After the IPO the parent Yatra Online will own about 70 of the shares which will have a valuation of about 325M based on the projected IPO price. Even after applying a discount equivalent to the cash raised from the IPO this will value Yatra Online shares at around 5. With the name recognition and trust along with investor appetite for shares of companies in the OTA space Yatra shares may rise after the India listing which could have a positive impact on the underlying valuation of Yatra online. Super Apps Mania The growing economy and the rising stock market have filled the coffers of large Indian conglomerates such as Adani Tata and Reliance. A few months back the chairman of the Adani group Gowtham Adani surpassed Jeff Bezos as the second richest person on the planet. As the conglomerates grow they are looking around to spread their bets and one of the areas they are looking into is online travel. Among the large Indian business groups there is a new trend of creating super apps on mobile along the lines of the Chinese giants WeChat and Alibaba BABA. These apps will offer all different parts of the businesses on a single app. Travel tends to be one of the most attractive pieces for any super app as travel is expected to be one of the fastestgrowing sectors of the Indian economy. Business Standard discusses this trend in the article Super app war Adani Tata and Reliance Industries go on an acquisition spree. According to the article Indias top business groups are scouting for acquisition targets to offer additional goods and services under their Super app umbrella in personal loans travel bookings and movie tickets. The super apps will use these services to attract users to their apps and offer many other core functions. Yatra an Acquisition Candidate In the travel segment only a handful of Indiafocused pureplay OTAs exist. The key ones are MakeMyTrip MMYT Yatra and EaseMyTrip. Cleartrip was another player. It was impacted by Covid and was acquired by Flipkart at a firesale price. MakeMyTrip is the most significant Indian OTA and is listed on Nasdaq. It has a market cap of 2. 7B making it an expensive acquisition target. EaseMyTrip is listed on the Indian stock exchange and carries a 1B valuation. Though the valuation may be within the range of acquisition for large groups EaseMyTrip is run more as a familyowned business by two brothers with tight control of the company with minimal resources. This model may not fit well in a large corporation looking to acquire and plug it into the corporate structure. This leaves Yatra. Yatra is a professionally run organization with a very experienced veteran leadership team in the online travel industry for many years. Though the company trimmed the workforce almost by half during the pandemic the corporate structure is maintained to grow efficiently as travel picks back up. Also Yatra has a robust customer loyalty program used as a surrogate loyalty program by the providers it serves. This could fit into the super apps where loyalty programs are a critical part of the attraction. As Yatra goes through the steps required for the IPO process after the approval a window of opportunity has opened up for some large companies in India to acquire Yatra. Potential Suitors Yatra is attractive as an acquisition candidate for each one of the business conglomerates we have discussed. This is because Yatra could thrive as an independent travel OTA under the umbrella of any of these business groups. The acquisition costs which likely to be at around the potential IPO pricing could be more than justified with Yatra being an independent entity. Being included as a super apps travel component would be a huge bonus. In addition to the conglomerates we looked at some other players might also be interested in acquiring Yatra. Now let us look at each of the potential acquirers of Yatra and how Yatra may fit their needs in a little more detail. Adani Group Adani group has grown at a breakneck speed in recent years. Adani group operates many airports in India including some busiest ones such as the Mumbai International Airport. Adani group has been looking at adjacent areas and to include everything in the form of a super app. In Oct 2021 the Adani group took a significant minority interest in Cleartrip which was owned by Flipkart then. Yatra may present an excellent opportunity for them to completely own a part of the growing OTA market in which the Adani group already has a strategic interest. Tata Group Tata Group owns a wide range of companies from building cars and software services to selling cooking salt. While they spent the last few decades expanding internationally recently they have been focusing more on operations within India. Early this year Tata Group took over Air India from the Indian government. Tata group already jointly owns Vistara airlines with Singapore Airlines and recently they acquired Air Asia also. Despite owning three different airlines in India they still have only about 20 of the market share while Indigo an Indian airline company owns almost 60 of the market. Tata released their super app called Nue in April22. Tata has tried to bring in all their group offerings in this super app including shopping and travel. Currently the travel part of the app is limited to Tataowned airlines and hotels only. However their goal is to offer all airlines and hotels from other providers on their app to make it more attractive. Here Yatra would fit in nicely. Reliance Group Reliance Group had invested in Yatra before Yatras listing on Nasdaq. Since then they have moved out of their position. With their prominent presence in mobile phone services and groceries they have all the elements needed for a super app. Reliance has already launched an app called MyJio with focus on groceries mobile and internet services. Yatra could expand the reach of the service making it a true super app. Others Flipkart acquired Cleartrip in 2021 in the middle of the pandemic. Cleartrip seems to thrive under Flipkart reporting strong growth and many new initiatives. Flipkart has been planning on going IPO by listing on Nasdaq and is looking for very high valuations in the order of 60B. To have travel as one of their core strengths when they go IPO at a high valuation they need to be dominant in travel challenging MakeMyTrip. The only way they could do that is through an acquisition. Acquiring Yatra would make them the secondlargest OTA in India instantly. It will also give them a strong foothold in corporate travel. Other companies such as Paytm and EbixCash might be interested in Yatra. However pursuing such an acquisition in their current situation might not make sense. Nevertheless in the situation changes it is possible that they could be potential contenders. Acquisition Might be Attractive for Yatra Yatras India subsidiary will go IPO likely in the later part of Q1 CY23. Pricing of the shares will be decided based on the interest. Even if the IPO of the Indian subsidiary gets a reasonably high valuation it may not be fully reflected in the share price of the Nasdaqlisted parent. Now at the point when the pricing of the IPO has been decided if one of the acquirers approaches Yatra with an offer equivalent to the proposed valuation it is highly likely that the Yatra board will consider such an offer seriously. This is because any buyout offer will be a cash offer directly translating to the Nasdaq listed share price with no discounts. For example if the offer is 450M which is the estimated target IPO price it would price the shares at 7. 25 almost 50 higher than that possible from an IPO. Recently there have been two key investors MAK Capital and Maguire Investment who hold a significant percentage of the shares of Yatra online. They are also represented on the board. If such an offer comes through it will be highly likely that these investors will push the management consider that offer seriously. Conclusion Multiple factors contribute to the secular growth of online travel in India including a growing economy increasing interest in travel and a move towards the online booking. This growth optimism is reflected in the stock price of EaseMyTrip a peer of Yatra trading at a valuation of more than 1B. The SEBI approval of Yatra IPO in India is a HUGE deal. It is highly likely that the India listed Yatra shares will be well received. Once the IPO pricing is decided and the shares are listed this has the potential to almost double the current value of Yatra Online shares. If that is not enough there is the possibility that one of the large conglomerates in India that are hungry to expand the offerings on their super apps could potentially acquire Yatra. This could result in even better stock appreciation for the Yatra stockholders. In a gloomy recessionfeared environment in the US Yatra Online shares are extremely attractive at these levels.

Elaborating on the differences between a traditional and a digital market the panel emphasised the need for exante regulationbased on market forecasts and behaviourof big tech companies rather than expost evaluation as is the case with the current system which mainly focuses on the actual results rather than market predictions. For such evaluation and regulation based on behaviour analysis the parliament broadly suggested three major recommendations to cover the dynamics of an online market wherein businesses tip quickly and expand further often by affecting fair competitive practices. Why does it matter Indias Competition Commission of India CCI has ordered an investigation into unfair and monopolistic business practices by Big Tech companies such as Google Apple Amazon and Swiggy and Zomato among other online platforms. The Parliament panel has previously observed the need to keep a check on anticompetitive practices in the digital ecosystem. This report further indicates the governments plan to expand the scope of CCI and also elaborates on the ways in which it is planning to regulate Big Tech firms in India in the near future. FREE READ of the day by MediaNama Click here to signup for our freeread of the day newsletter delivered daily before 9 AM in your inbox. Here are the three major recommendations for regulation 1. Identifying Systematically Important Digital Media Intermediaries SIDI The Committee recommends that India must identify leading players or those market winners who may negatively influence competition in a digital ecosystem as Systemically Important Digital Intermediaries SIDI. These SIDIs must be identified on the basis of their revenues the number of active business and end users and their market capitalisation. The CCI and the central government must in collaboration with stakeholders deliberate on a reasonable definition of SIDIs for exante regulation of their behaviour. Within certain fixed months of being designated as a SIDI a platform must annually submit a report to the Commission regarding its compliance with its mandatory obligations. It must also publish a nonconfidential summary of the report on its website. 2. Digital Competition Act The Committee recommends that the Indian government should consider introducing a Digital Competition Act to ensure a fair transparent and contestable digital ecosystem in sync with the countrys evolving startup ecosystem and global policies. 3. Revamping of the Competition Commission of India CCI Establishing a specialised Digital Markets Unit within the CCI. The staff must include skilled experts academics and attorneys enabling the Commission to closely monitor SIDIs and emerging SIDIs review SIDI compliance adjudicate on digital market cases and conduct efficient and effective monitoring of digital markets. The unit must also keep a check and track of similar unfair practices of other digital players even though not specifically designated as SIDIs. This post is released under a CCBYSA 4. 0 license.
