L on Tuesday of virtue signalling with its ethicallyfocused marketing in his latest salvo against the consumer goods giant. Smith whose Fundsmith vehicle is Unilevers 15th biggest shareholder according to Refinitiv also said in his annual letter to investors that the maker of Hellmanns mayonnaise and Dove soap had for years ignored his funds advice on the need to improve performance. Yet the company had recently added activist investor Nelson Peltz to its board. Peltz who cofounded investment firm Trian Partners is known for reshaping corporate Csuites and has previously been on the boards of Ritz crackermaker Mondelez International Inc MDLZ. O and ketchupmaker Heinz now known as Kraft Heinz Co KHC. O. Based on our experience we tend to get ignored whereas an activist who has held shares for fewer months than we have held in years gets invited to board meetings Smith wrote. I dont know how long Trian held its stake before Mr Peltz was invited to join the board or how big that stake was but I would guess that they held it for far fewer months than we have held it in terms of years. Yet Smith said he had no objection to Mr Peltzs involvement and did not want a board seat. Trian did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last year Smith gave Unilever a dressing down for its failed 50 billion pound 61 billion bid for GSKs GSK. L consumer health assets and urged management to focus on improving performance. He also attacked Unilevers purposedriven marketing saying the company had clearly lost the plot in feeling like it has to define the purpose of Hellmanns mayonnaise. On Tuesday Smith reiterated we dont know how well it Hellmanns would have grown without the virtue signalling purpose adding that maybe Hellmanns would be growing as fast or even faster without its purpose. The words virtue signalling were struck through in Smiths letter. Unilever which did not comment says on its website its 400 brands from Magnum ice cream to Sunsilk shampoo are on a global mission to do good. Many back social or environmental causes like recycling plastics in the case of Hellmanns. Smith also accused Unilever of a lack of transparency over small acquisitions. Shouldnt we have some idea how Unilever and its management have performed before they are allowed to do any more acquisitions Unilevers low return on capital might be a clue. 1 0. 8217 pounds Our Standards The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.,2023-01-10T10:00:00Z
