It wasnt just that Clapton was talented it was that uniquely for British rock at the time he was the Yardbirds star attraction. His presence so obviously overshadowed that of their frontman Keith Relf that one of their peers wrote a song about it. Manfred Manns The One in the Middle affectionately mocked Relf as just a pretty face. Curiously Relf could never be talked into performing it. Trying to replace Clapton you might assume was a hiding to nowhere anyone who tried was being set up to fail. But Jeff Beck who had been recommended for the job by his friend Jimmy Page didnt just replace Clapton. He transformed the Yardbirds from blues purists struggling to square their love of Buddy Guy and Freddie King with the necessity of having pop hits Clapton had walked out in protest at the band recording and releasing Graham Gouldmans For Your Love as a single to a band at the vanguard of British pops relentless forward progress. The first single he recorded with them Heart Full of Soul was another Gouldman confection enlivened by Beck mimicking the sound of sitar some months before the Beatles first deployed the instrument on Norwegian Wood with a guitar played through a distortion pedal called a Tone Bender. There was a hint of Whoish feedback about his aggressive playing on its followup Evil Hearted You if you flipped the single over you were confronted with the droning Still Im Sad with its Gregorian chantinspired vocals a signpost en route to the experimentation of psychedelia. By the time of February 1966s Shapes of Things howling feedback a guitar solo audibly influenced by Indian raga or as Beck put it some weird mist coming from the east out of my amp the Yardbirds sounded like a completely different band from the one who had powered their way through covers of Smokestack Lightning and Good Morning Little Schoolgirl on 1964s Five Live Yardbirds. Beck could play the blues if he wanted to listen to his slide playing on Heart Full of Souls Bside Steeled Blues but he was no ones idea of a respectful purist. Tellingly the song that had first piqued his interest in playing guitar was Les Paul and Mary Fords groundbreaking 1951 hit How High the Moon a single that was as much about Pauls electronic manipulation of sound through multitracking as it was about his guitar playing. When Becks mother dismissed it as all tricks it only served to fire his enthusiasm further. Throughout his tenure with the Yardbirds Beck seemed as interested in the sonic possibilities of new technology as he did in demonstrating his instrumental prowess making all the weirdest noise I could. The result was a succession of tracks that propelled the Yardbirds to the forefront of pops avant garde Over Under Sideways Down Lost Woman Hot House of Omagararshid Hes Always There. When Jimmy Page joined briefly creating a lineup with two lead guitarists their sound got more extreme still. The single that coupled Happenings Ten Years Time Ago and Psycho Daisies was impossibly potent and sinister so farout even by the standards of 1966 that it succeeded in alienating their fans it barely scraped the charts in the UK and the critics one of whom derided it as an excuse for music. Not long after its release Beck acrimoniously departed the Yardbirds. They kicked me out fuck them he waspishly noted during the bands 1992 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Producer Mickie Most attempted to fashion him into a pop star a role to which Beck was entirely illsuited although the union produced the hit single and wedding disco perennial Hi Ho Silver Lining. His real future however lay on its Bside an instrumental called Becks Bolero that he had recorded with Page bassist John Paul Jones and the Whos Keith Moon back in May 1966. It was epic heavy and quite astonishingly prescient pointing towards the direction rock would follow in the postpsychedelic era a year before the Summer of Love. It still sounded ahead of the curve when it turned up on Becks solo album Truth two years later. By then Beck had recruited singer Rod Stewart with his bluesy vocals playing off Becks incendiary distorted guitar Truths eclectic set of material a reworking of Shapes of Things plus versions of Greensleeves Ol Man River and Willie Dixons I Aint Superstitous presaged the sound of Led Zeppelin the band Jimmy Page formed from the wreckage of the now defunct Yardbirds. Truth beat Led Zeppelins eponymous debut into the shops by six months. Perhaps the Jeff Beck Group which Truths followup BeckOla was billed under could have followed Zeppelins path to superstardom. But there were problems not least with maintaining a steady lineup. Stewart departed after BeckOla an attempt to replace him with the thenunknown Elton John only got as far the rehearsal studio taking bassist Ronnie Wood with him to form the Faces. Pianist Nicky Hopkins left too drummers came and went. The fact that Beck couldnt keep still musically may also have hindered their commercial progress. BeckOla was very much in the heavy style of Truth Spanish Boots is particularly fantastic but subsequent releases dabbled in funk jazz and soul. Both 1971s Rough and Ready and 1972s Jeff Beck Group have their moments Ive Been Used and Jody on the former Ice Cream Cakes and Going Down on the latter but the NME critic who noted that the bands musical skill frequently far exceeds that of the material had a point. In addition it was hard not to be struck by the sense that Beck wasnt that bothered about being famous hence BeckOlas selfdeprecating sleeve note Its almost impossible to come up with anything totally original so we havent. By 1973 Beck had formed a new band with bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice. They might have had a hit single with Superstition a song Stevie Wonder had given to Beck in return for performing on Talking Book you can hear his beautifully delicate and sympathetic playing on its penultimate track Lookin for Another Pure Love had Wonder not changed his mind and released it as a single himself complete with the iconic opening drum beat that Beck had come up with. The pair worked together again on Becks largely instrumental 1975 solo album Blow by Blow on which the guitarist changed course again this time to dextrous jazzrock fusion. Its successor Wired featured a version of Charles Minguss Goodbye Pork Pie Hat. By now no one could predict where Beck was going to head next. Flash from 1985 was a pop album produced by Nile Rodgers albeit a pop album decorated with guitar solos that sounded close to contemporary heavy metal. Beck subsequently professed to hate it. Jeff Becks Guitar Shop 1989 was an instrumental bluesrock album. Crazy Legs 1993 was entirely comprised of Gene Vincent covers. Who Else 1999 bore the influence of ambient electronica and techno THX138 and Psycho Sam sounded unbelievably not unlike the Chemical Brothers or the Prodigy. He collaborated with Guns N Roses Kate Bush Roger Waters Hans Zimmer and Jon Bon Jovi. It was all evidence of a disinclination to be pigeonholed the only thing you could rely on was that whatever direction his music took his guitar playing would be incredible. It was the kind of career that baffled the general public of his latterday albums only the relatively straightforward Emotion Commotion which saw him working with Joss Stone and Imelda May was really a hit and obscure quite how innovative Beck had been in the 60s. But it won him the undying admiration of his fellow musicians the phrase guitarists guitarist might have been invented for him. His influence spanned generations. Brian May David Gilmour Slash and The Edge all attested to being inspired by Beck. Metallicas Kirk Hammett claimed he learned guitar by playing along to the Jeff Beck Groups Let Me Love You. The Red Hot Chili Peppers John Frusciante recalled listening to Truth as a kid and marvelling at Beck pulling all these sounds out of the guitar I didnt know where they were coming from. Even Eric Clapton whose departure from the Yardbirds had kickstarted Becks career marvelled at his replacement the most unique guitarist and the most devoted. His last project was an album he released with Johnny Depp a move that catapulted him into the news 18 appeared in the wake of Depps defamation case against his former wife Amber Heard. The controversy overshadowed the albums contents which were as unpredictable as ever. Trying to explain its tracklisting on which a cover of the Velvet Undergrounds Venus in Furs lurked alongside versions of the Beach Boys Dont Talk Put Your Head on My Shoulder Killing Jokes Death and Resurrection Show and Smokey Robinsons Ooo Baby Baby Jeff Beck came up with a line that neatly summed up his entire career. Interesting things happen he said when youre open to trying something different.
1,‘I’m scared to think what Ethiopia will become’: Tigray war refugees fear return,"A fragile peace has been restored but for tens of thousands of displaced people who fled to Sudan there is no prospect of going homeWhen she remembers the corpses on the asphalt, the bodies of her neighbours and of the boy who used to play with her children, …",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jan/05/im-scared-to-think-what-ethiopia-will-become-tigray-war-refugees-fear-return,When she remembers the corpses on the asphalt the bodies of her neighbours and of the boy who used to play with her children Lemlen Abraha breaks down in tears. They just shot him she says of 14yearold Kalayu Mebrahtom killed by government soldiers in the first weeks of Ethiopias civil war and left to be buried by his grandmother. Id left my home to buy sugar I saw it on the street I saw it with my own eyes. Since the war began two years ago Lemlen has been living in a refugee camp in Sudan with two of her teenage children and four others whose parents are missing. Lemlens sixyearold daughter Hiyab and her husband Fisseha are still lost separated in the chaos. When the Guardian met Lemlen in early December weeks after a peace deal ostensibly had ended the war she didnt know if they were alive or dead. She still doesnt. A fragile Yet in Sudan near the border of Ethiopia and the disputed territory of what is officially called western Tigray tens of thousands of refugees remain in limbo unable or too afraid to return home. Refugees mostly ethnic Tigrayans from the Wolkait district of western Tigray but also some from smaller ethnic groups such as the Kemant Kunama and Irob told the Guardian their land was still occupied by armed forces from Ethiopias Amhara region or in some cases allied troops from neighbouring Eritrea. Lemlen had found a piece of paper pinned to her door in the town of Baeker in western Tigray. Scrawled on it was a threat all Tigrayans must leave the town or face the consequences. She reached Sudan in November 2020. She says she has heard from her former neighbours in Amhara that her home has been occupied by newcomers who have also started working her familys plot of land. Human rights groups have described these patterns of dispossession and violence as ethnic cleansing. According to Amnesty and Human Rights Watch Amhara militia and volunteer fighters known as Fanos established Amhara government administration over the fertile agricultural territory between late 2020 and 2022. Hundreds of thousands of Tigrayans were expelled and Amhara farmers resettled there. If the international community protects the displaced people Lemlen suggests perhaps it would be safe for them to return. But she sees no imminent prospect of that. The peace deal stated that the question of disputed territories which include parts of south Tigray should be settled through constitutional means which may one day mean a referendum. But it set out no timeline. Eritrean troops who have been implicated in some of the wars worst atrocities pose another challenge. The peace deal signed in South Africa by the government of prime minister Abiy Ahmed and Tigrays leaders the Tigrayan Peoples Liberation Front TPLF made no mention of the Eritreans. But an implementation roadmap signed a few days later in Kenya specified that the gradual disarmament of Tigrays forces would take place alongside the withdrawal of foreign and nonENDF federal military forces from the region. In recent days there have been reports of Eritrean troops withdrawing from some towns in Tigray. But as recently as December according to minutes seen by the Guardian from a meeting of the Tigray Emergency Coordination Centre a hub of UN agencies and NGOs Eritrean troops continued to loot kill kidnap and rape. One refugee with relatives living near the town of Adwa told the Guardian his young cousin was killed by Eritrean forces in a nearby village in midDecember. Until Eritrea leaves there will be no peace says Solomon a Tigrayan teacher who fled Humera a city near the Sudan and Eritrea borders at the start of the war. On rare occasions when he has been able to reach friends and family in western Tigray they have said the same thing that until at least midDecember Eritrean troops were stationed along key highways and migration routes including those leading to Sudan. Aid workers confirmed these accounts but it is unclear how many Eritrean troops remain today. Elsewhere in Tigray food aid and medical supplies have been trickling in since November staving off the worst of starvation. Phone lines and internet services suspended during the war are being switched back on sporadically allowing communication with the outside world for the first time in many months. Mekelle has been reconnected to the national grid and partial banking services have resumed in some towns. In Mekelle the phone network is working a Tigrayan in Kenya told the Guardian by text message on 29 December. I spoke with my family I think they are OK. On 28 December an Ethiopian Airlines plane touched down in Mekelle the first commercial flight in 18 months effectively lifting the ban on movement in place since June 2021. The next day Ethiopian federal police arrived in Mekelle to guard federal government facilities a visible return to normality. However there remains a climate of uncertainty. Excitement over restored phone lines for example is tempered by fears of surveillance. If you call you put people in danger says Abeba a refugee who fled western Tigray at the start of the war. Three refugees said friends or family members had disappeared shortly after receiving phone calls from Sudan. If they security forces see someone receive a call from a Sudan number they will be arrested she says. Insecurity prevails in Ethiopia as war has wound down in Tigray it has escalated in Oromia the largest region which has seen drone strikes on civilians and a string of gruesome interethnic massacres. The Oromo Liberation Army OLA another armed group is not part of the current peace deal. Nor are smaller ones linked to minorities such as the Gumuz Agew or Kemant. OLA fighters as well as Oromo security forces stand accused of killing civilians in Oromia Amhara civilians continue to face indiscriminate violence in places where they are a minority. In recent months Amhara militias are also reported to have conducted raids and killings inside Oromia. In the Amhara region meanwhile violence continues against Kemant civilians by regional security forces and militias. Kemant refugees told the Guardian they would not return without security assurance as most of their lands are now occupied. Irob and Kunama refugees whose smaller populations live close to Eritrea want guarantees regarding Eritrean troops along the border with Ethiopia. UN officials say the current peace should be seen as a starting point an opportunity to build confidence among Ethiopians before seeking to address some of the more contentious issues around disputed territories. There is recognition that this will take time. Emebet a 23yearold university student has tried to stop daydreaming about going home. She learned from neighbours that her apartment in Humera damaged by shelling at the start of the war has been repaired and is being rented to newcomers. In the straw hut she shares with her husband Emebet has hung colourful drapes from the ceiling trying to make the place homely. There is a small Sudanese flag in the corner of her makeshift kitchen a tribute to the country that has offered them refuge. Im scared to think about what Ethiopia will become says Emebet referring to the deepening distrust between communities. She doubts whether refugees from western Tigray will ever return if the peace holds she thinks most of them will relocate elsewhere. I dont think we can ever go back.
2,Mercedes-Benz will build a $1 billion EV fast-charging network in the US,"Working with ChargePoint, it will install more than 2,500 chargers at 400 sites by 2027.",https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/01/mercedes-benz-to-build-an-ev-fast-charging-network-starting-in-the-us/,On Thursday MercedesBenz announced that it is entering the DC fastcharging arena for electric vehicles. The German automaker is in the midst of an electrification push and a plan to be carbonneutral by 2039 and it evidently doesnt believe that the current charging infrastructure is as good as its new EVs so its doing something about the situation. Mercedes says it plans to deploy more than 10000 fast chargers around the world starting in North America. The new network is separate from and independent of Ionity the European fastcharging network backed by Mercedes BMW Ford and Volkswagen. Here in the US Mercedes is partnering with the charging company ChargePoint and MN8 Energy a solar and batterystorage company. Together they will deploy more than 2500 DC fast chargers at more than 400 sites around the US by 2027. MercedesBenz customers deserve a compelling charging experience that makes electric vehicle ownership and longdistance travel effortless and thats why we are launching a global highend charging network that will offer a charging experience to match the extraordinary Mercedes driving experience said Ola Kllenius chairman of the board of management of MercedesBenz Group AG. We are excited to start right here in North America with two strong and experienced partners ChargePoint and MN8 Energy. The chargers will feature plugandcharge compatibility and wont be restricted to Mercedes EVs. Mercedes also says the locations and surroundings will be carefully chosenall too often banks of DC chargers are located in desolate and lonely corners of mall parking lots that can make charging at night a stressful experience for some drivers. So the OEM plans to build the chargers with food outlets and restrooms situated nearby. It also says there will be surveillance cameras and other security in place to provide a safe and secure charging environment. At least four plugs per hub maybe as many as 30 Expect a minimum of four DC chargers at each hub similar to an Electrify America charging location. But some hubs will have as many as 12 chargers and there are plans for as many as 30 in some locations. The hubs will use ChargePoints modular Express Plus system which is capable of up to 500 kW per charging port although Mercedes says that chargers will be up to 350 kW in power. And load management will ensure that if multiple EVs are charging at the same time one charger doesnt end up throttling the rest. With this partnership we are expanding upon our existing relationships with MercedesBenz and MN8 to deliver a seamless charging experience for drivers and turnkey charging solutions at no upfront cost to site hosts said ChargePoint CEO Pasquale Romano. We believe the expansion of charging hubs like these will enable the emergence of a new 30minute retail economy at the intersection of innovation and accessibility that combines charging and commerce giving drivers a superior experience to charge quickly and easily. In keeping with the companys 2039 sustainability goals the electricity it uses will come from green energy suppliers or come with renewable energy certificates. Some hubs will use solar to power the lighting and security cameras. MN8 Energy is on a mission to provide enterprise customers such as MercedesBenz with renewable energy and related solutions on their journey to an electrified decarbonized world said MN8 Energy President and CEO Jon Yoder. Supporting the development of this exceptional charging experience helps address one of the most significant barriers to EV adoptionrange anxiety. With each party playing to their strengths we are thrilled to embark on this collaboration to expand charging access with MercedesBenz and ChargePoint. None of this will be particularly cheap. In fact the initiative will cost more than 1. 1 billion 1 billion euro over the next six or seven years with the costs split evenly between Mercedes and MN8 Energy. And this is just the startplans for more charger deployment in Europe and China will be announced in the future.

He was 78. Beck died Tuesday after suddenly contracting bacterial meningitis his representatives said in a statement released Wednesday. The location was not immediately known. Jeff was such a nice person and an outstanding iconic genius guitar player there will never be another Jeff Beck Tony Iommi guitarist for Black Sabbath wrote on Twitter among the many tributes. Beck first came to prominence as a member of the Yardbirds and then went out on his own in a solo career that incorporated hard rock jazz funky blues and even opera. He was known for his improvising love of harmonics and the whammy bar on his preferred guitar the Fender Stratocaster. Jeff Beck is the best guitar player on the planet Joe Perry the lead guitarist of Aerosmith told The New York Times in 2010. He is head hands and feet above all the rest of us with the kind of talent that appears only once every generation or two. Beck was among the rockguitarist pantheon from the late 60s that included Eric Clapton Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix. Beck won eight Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice once with the Yardbirds in 1992 and again as a solo artist in 2009. He was ranked fifth in Rolling Stone magazines list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. Jeff could channel music from the ethereal Page tweeted Wednesday. Beck played guitar with vocalists as varied as Luciano Pavarotti Macy Gray Chrissie Hynde Joss Stone Imelda May Cyndi Lauper Wynonna Judd Buddy Guy and Johnny Depp. He made two records with Rod Stewart 1968s Truth and 1969s BeckOla and one with a 64piece orchestra Emotion Commotion. I like an element of chaos in music. That feeling is the best thing ever as long as you dont have too much of it. Its got to be in balance. I just saw Cirque du Soleil and it struck me as complete organized chaos he told Guitar World in 2014. If I could turn that into music its not far away from what my ultimate goal would be which is to delight people with chaos and beauty at the same time. Beck career highlights include joining with bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice to create the power trio that released Beck Bogert and Appice in 1973 tours with Brian Wilson and Buddy Guy and a tribute album to the late guitarist Les Paul Rock n Roll Party Honoring Les Paul. Becks album credits include Talking Book Stevie Wonders landmark 1972 album. His tenderly rendered guitar solo on the ballad Lookin For Another Pure Love won him a warm Do it Jeff callout from Wonder that was included on the album cut. Geoffrey Arnold Beck was born in Surrey England and attended Wimbledon Art College. His father was an accountant and his mother worked in a chocolate factory. As a boy he built his first instrument using a cigar box a picture frame for the neck and string from a radiocontrolled toy airplane. He was in a few bands including Nightshift and The Tridents before joining the Yardbirds in 1965 replacing Clapton but only a year later giving way to Page. During his tenure the band created the memorable singles Heart Full of Soul Im a Man and Shapes of Things. Becks first hit single was 1967s instrumental Becks Bolero which featured future Led Zeppelin members Page and John Paul Jones and The Who drummer Keith Moon. The Jeff Beck Group with Stewart singing was later booked to play the 1969 Woodstock music festival but their appearance was canceled. Beck later said there was unrest in the band. I could see the end of the tunnel he told Rolling Stone in 2010. Beck was friends with Hendrix and they performed together. Before Hendrix most rock guitar players concentrated on a similar style and technical vocabulary. Hendrix blew that apart. He came along and reset all of the rules in one evening Beck told Guitar World. Beck teamed up with legendary producer George Martin a. k. a. the fifth Beatle to help him fashion the genremelding jazzfusion classic Blow by Blow 1975 and Wired 1976. He teamed up with Seal on the Hendrix tribute Stone Free created a jazzfusion group led by synthesizer player Jan Hammer and honored rockabilly guitarist Cliff Gallup with the album Crazy Legs. He put out Loud Hailer in 2016. Becks guitar work can be heard on the soundtracks of such films as Stomp the Yard Shallow Hal Casino Honeymoon in Vegas Twins Observe and Report and Little Big League. Beck recently completed a tour supporting his album with Depp 18 and was heard on Ozzy Osbournes Patient Number 9 album. Becks career never hit the commercial highs of Clapton. A perfectionist he preferred to make critically wellreceived instrumental records and left the limelight for long stretches enjoying his time restoring vintage automobiles. He and Clapton had a tense relationship early on but became friends in later life and toured together. Why did the two wait some four decades to tour together Because we were all trying to be big bananas Beck told Rolling Stone in 2010. Except I didnt have the luxury of the hit songs Erics got. Beck is survived by his wife Sandra. AP reporter Scott Stroud in Nashville contributed to this report.

Yet unlike them Beck was something of a reluctant celebrity unwilling to pursue the superstardom that his musical gifts could have brought him. When Led Zeppelin made it so big I was jealous absolutely jealous as hell Beck said in 1986. But Im glad I carried on as I was. I personally couldnt have put up with that mass adulation. When Clapton and Page appeared at Live Aid in 1985 Beck preferred to stay at home and tinker with his beloved collection of classic hot rod cars. I didnt want to go because I hate large crowds he claimed. The Melody Maker journalist Chris Welch wrote that he can appear sullen lazy and difficult. He has an expressive face that appears to give away his every mood and thought. Nonetheless Beck was a central figure in several key developments in rock musics history. As a member of the Yardbirds in 196566 he featured on some of their bestknown hits including Heart Full of Soul and Shapes of Things while expanding the bands musical palette hugely. His solo recording Becks Bolero was a firework display of contrasting guitar techniques and textures and pointed to Becks future in which he would move away from mere rock to embrace jazz fusion and even classical crossover. His 2010 album Emotion Commotion included versions of Benjamin Brittens Corpus Christi Carol and Puccinis Nessun Dorma interpreted through Becks uniquely sensitive touch. He would frequently pick strings with his thumb while modifying tone and pitch with the tremolo bar. Becks gifts burned most intensely after he left the Yardbirds in November 1966 and formed the first incarnation of the Jeff Beck Group in early 1967 featuring Ronnie Wood on bass and the telltale rasping vocals of Rod Stewart. Becks previously recorded solo hit Hi Ho Silver Lining which reached 14 on the UK chart in the spring of 67 gave the group a handy launch platform although their debut album Truth was not released until the following year. When it was it reached 15 on the US chart. This was largely down to the groups tour manager Peter Grant later Led Zeppelins manager who had taken the band to the US for some ecstatically received live performances and then persuaded Epic Records to sign them. Truths soulful mix of blues and hard rock was a trailblazer for a new wave of bands not least Led Zeppelin themselves whose own debut album appeared six months later. Although Truth failed to chart in Britain the Beck bands second album BeckOla gave them another No 15 hit in the US and this time reached the UK Top 40 and they followed up with successful touring in the US but internal friction was beginning to pull the unit apart. With impeccably poor timing they broke up just before they were due to play at the Woodstock festival. Stewart launched his solo career and formed the Faces with Wood. A rebuilt Jeff Beck Group released the albums Rough and Ready 1971 and Jeff Beck Group 1972 but the magic moment had passed. Beck was born at his familys home in Wallington then in Surrey but now in south London. His father Arnold was an accountant and his mother Ethel worked in a chocolate factory. Jeff attended Sutton Manor primary school and Sutton East county secondary modern. He credited his mother with pushing him to study music because she used to force me to play piano about two hours a day. But that was good because it made me realise I was musically sound. He became fascinated by the electric guitar when he heard Les Pauls version of How High the Moon. After experimenting with stretching rubber bands over tobacco cans and making horrible noises he graduated to an old and battered acoustic guitar and then built his own instrument using a cigar box and a picture frame. Beck attended Wimbledon Art College where he was mostly preoccupied with guitarplaying inspired by albums by American bluesmen such as Buddy Guy and Muddy Waters. He bought himself an electric guitar and played briefly with Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages and in 1963 formed the Nightshift who recorded the single Stormy Monday. Later that year he joined an RB band the Tridents. He took a great leap forward in 1965 when he joined the Yardbirds replacing Clapton. This was on the recommendation of Page whom Beck had known since being introduced to him by his sister Annetta in his teens. He was with the Yardbirds for less than two years but during this period they recorded some of their bestknown material including the hit singles Heart Full of Soul featuring Becks ragalike guitar a UK No 2 and a Top 10 hit in the US Evil Hearted You UK No 3 Shapes of Things UK No 3 and Over Under Sideways Down UK No 10. Happenings Ten Years Time Ago 1966 only made it to 43 on the UK chart and 30 in the US but its complex mix of guitar parts by both Beck and Page have led to it being considered a milestone along the road to fullblown psychedelia. Page would go on to bend the boundaries of rock music with Led Zeppelin while Beck was experimenting with different tunings and feedback effects. In May 1966 Beck made his first solo recording Becks Bolero. It featured Page the Whos drummer Keith Moon and the future Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones indeed the musicians on the track almost became Led Zeppelin but was not released until it became the B side of Becks single Hi Ho Silver Lining the following year. Based on the rhythm of Ravels Bolero it was a spectacular display of guitar tonalities from ethereal slide guitar to hardrock riffing and suggested the extent of Becks ambitions. After the Jeff Beck Group ended he formed the power trio Beck Bogert and Appice in 1972 his bandmates being exmembers of Vanilla Fudge but the project failed to match expectations and they split in 1974. In 1975 Beck reemerged in a jazzinflected guise with the allinstrumental album Blow by Blow produced by George Martin. It became Becks most successful album reaching No 4 on the US chart and selling a million copies. For Wired 1976 he teamed up with Narada Michael Walden and Jan Hammer veterans of the Mahavishnu Orchestra. Subsequent live shows were preserved on Jeff Beck With the Jan Hammer Group Live 1977. Beck released intermittent solo albums including Flash 1985 Jeff Becks Guitar Shop 1989 and Jeff 2003. Flash delivered a hit single with a cover version of Curtis Mayfields People Get Ready and the track Escape won Beck the first of his eight Grammy awards. He made guest appearances on Mick Jaggers album Primitive Cool 1987 and Roger Waterss Amused to Death 1992. In 2020 he released the single Isolation a John Lennon song on which he collaborated with the actor Johnny Depp. In July last year the pair released an album 18 after Depp had joined Beck onstage for some UK and European concerts. Beck was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 for his work with the Yardbirds and in 2009 for his solo career. He is survived by his second wife Sandra Cash whom he married in 2005.

He was 78. Beck died Tuesday after suddenly contracting bacterial meningitis his representatives said in a statement released Wednesday. The location was not immediately known. Jeff was such a nice person and an outstanding iconic genius guitar player there will never be another Jeff Beck Tony Iommi guitarist for Black Sabbath wrote on Twitter among the many tributes. Beck first came to prominence as a member of the Yardbirds and then went out on his own in a solo career that incorporated hard rock jazz funky blues and even opera. He was known for his improvising love of harmonics and the whammy bar on his preferred guitar the Fender Stratocaster. Jeff Beck is the best guitar player on the planet Joe Perry the lead guitarist of Aerosmith told The New York Times in 2010. He is head hands and feet above all the rest of us with the kind of talent that appears only once every generation or two. Beck was among the rockguitarist pantheon from the late 60s that included Eric Clapton Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix. Beck won eight Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice once with the Yardbirds in 1992 and again as a solo artist in 2009. He was ranked fifth in Rolling Stone magazines list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. Jeff could channel music from the ethereal Page tweeted Wednesday. Beck played guitar with vocalists as varied as Luciano Pavarotti Macy Gray Chrissie Hynde Joss Stone Imelda May Cyndi Lauper Wynonna Judd Buddy Guy and Johnny Depp. He made two records with Rod Stewart 1968s Truth and 1969s BeckOla and one with a 64piece orchestra Emotion Commotion. I like an element of chaos in music. That feeling is the best thing ever as long as you dont have too much of it. Its got to be in balance. I just saw Cirque du Soleil and it struck me as complete organized chaos he told Guitar World in 2014. If I could turn that into music its not far away from what my ultimate goal would be which is to delight people with chaos and beauty at the same time. Beck career highlights include joining with bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice to create the power trio that released Beck Bogert and Appice in 1973 tours with Brian Wilson and Buddy Guy and a tribute album to the late guitarist Les Paul Rock n Roll Party Honoring Les Paul. Becks album credits include Talking Book Stevie Wonders landmark 1972 album. His tenderly rendered guitar solo on the ballad Lookin For Another Pure Love won him a warm Do it Jeff callout from Wonder that was included on the album cut. Geoffrey Arnold Beck was born in Surrey England and attended Wimbledon Art College. His father was an accountant and his mother worked in a chocolate factory. As a boy he built his first instrument using a cigar box a picture frame for the neck and string from a radiocontrolled toy airplane. He was in a few bands including Nightshift and The Tridents before joining the Yardbirds in 1965 replacing Clapton but only a year later giving way to Page. During his tenure the band created the memorable singles Heart Full of Soul Im a Man and Shapes of Things. Becks first hit single was 1967s instrumental Becks Bolero which featured future Led Zeppelin members Page and John Paul Jones and The Who drummer Keith Moon. The Jeff Beck Group with Stewart singing was later booked to play the 1969 Woodstock music festival but their appearance was canceled. Beck later said there was unrest in the band. I could see the end of the tunnel he told Rolling Stone in 2010. Beck was friends with Hendrix and they performed together. Before Hendrix most rock guitar players concentrated on a similar style and technical vocabulary. Hendrix blew that apart. He came along and reset all of the rules in one evening Beck told Guitar World. Beck teamed up with legendary producer George Martin a. k. a. the fifth Beatle to help him fashion the genremelding jazzfusion classic Blow by Blow 1975 and Wired 1976. He teamed up with Seal on the Hendrix tribute Stone Free created a jazzfusion group led by synthesizer player Jan Hammer and honored rockabilly guitarist Cliff Gallup with the album Crazy Legs. He put out Loud Hailer in 2016. Becks guitar work can be heard on the soundtracks of such films as Stomp the Yard Shallow Hal Casino Honeymoon in Vegas Twins Observe and Report and Little Big League. Beck recently completed a tour supporting his album with Depp 18 and was heard on Ozzy Osbournes Patient Number 9 album. Becks career never hit the commercial highs of Clapton. A perfectionist he preferred to make critically wellreceived instrumental records and left the limelight for long stretches enjoying his time restoring vintage automobiles. He and Clapton had a tense relationship early on but became friends in later life and toured together. Why did the two wait some four decades to tour together Because we were all trying to be big bananas Beck told Rolling Stone in 2010. Except I didnt have the luxury of the hit songs Erics got. Beck is survived by his wife Sandra. AP reporter Scott Stroud in Nashville contributed to this report. Mark Kennedy is at httptwitter. comKennedyTwits

Given the number of automakers moving toward electrification and the amount of money entering the arena its surprising that we havent seen another manufacturer doing the same. MercedesBenz is jumping in to change that announcing its intention to build a network of 10000 fast chargers. Automotive News reported that Mercedes made the announcement at CES. The automaker said its first steps would happen in Canada and the United States. The green energypowered chargers will expand to Europe and parts of Asia by 2030. The chargers wont be locked to Mercedes customers like Teslas Superchargers were until recently though owners will receive priority access and special pricing. The automaker plans to spend billions on developing and implementing the network but believes its investment will become an asset over time. This is something that you will be able to monetize when you come out of the investment phase the companys CEO noted. Mercedes boss Ola Kllenius also believes customers deserve a seamless charging experience and easy longdistance travel. Kllenius said the company would not be slow with the rollout. We wont take a waitandsee approach for this to be built he noted. The company appears to back that sentiment up with action plans saying it would build more than 400 charging locations and 2500 chargers across North America.

12,"The People Who Saw What Elon Musk Is Doing to Twitter and Said, “Yes, Hire Me”","“I think everyone says crazy stuff at a certain point,” one Twitter applicant said of his prospective new boss.",https://slate.com/technology/2022/12/twitter-jobs-hiring-elon-musk.html,Elon Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 28 becoming its owner chief twit and emotional weathermaker. Within seven days hed gotten rid of half of the companys 7500 employees. Within a couple of weeks hed oust an estimated 1000 more by urging anyone who was not extremely hardcore to go. As furious goodbyes wistful reflections and salute emojis filled the platform a different type of tweet also emerged. Though the language varied the message was the same I just applied for a job at Twitter Employees had long known that a Musk takeover meant layoffs. At one point he had told investors that he planned to cut 75 percent of Twitters workforce in order to push the company toward profitability. The company had been hemorrhaging 4 million a day he estimated in his layoff letter. But somehow this was even more chaotic and insulting than many had imagined it would be. It wasnt just that people were being asked to work 12hour shifts seven days a week following the companys sale as CNBC reported or that some laidoff employees were called back as Platformer reported. Nor was it simply that racist homophobic and antisemitic commentary was proliferating on the site. It was that he was treating the whole thing like it was a hilarious game. When it became clear that two employees giving interviews about losing their jobs were pranksters who did not work at Twitter he invited them in. During their meeting he offered one a job at Twitter making a lying performance artist one of the first hires of Twitter 2. 0. Still the readytoworkforyou tweets just kept coming. Together they helped reinforce the idea that no matter what Musk did there would be people jumping to join him. I found myself wondering Who were these people Had they actually applied And if so were they just a bunch of Musk superfans or were they motivated by something else The answerat least in a few caseswas something else Id learn from talking to them. And yes they really did apply. Daniel Zhao an economist at Glassdoor the workplace review and job search website was perhaps the first to try to quantify what you might call the Musk Effect on Twitter job applications. Once the Twitter board accepted Musks offer to buy Twitter in April interest in working at the company surged by around 260 percent over typical Glassdoor levels he observed in May. On Twitter Zhao offered a theory as to why Say what you will about Elon he does have a large fanbase of ppl excited to work for him. It was a logical theory. Everyone knows the man has fans. On Twitter they include lots of people with user names that feature long strings of numbers and Limp Bizkits frontman On all platforms they have a reputation for being not only uniquely loyal but also uniquely irritating. As one Oxford student who attempted to quantitatively analyze just how insufferable they are wrote Musk fans are the worst among all fandoms. Stunts like delivering their hero a 600000 statue of his head atop a goat straddling a rocket encourage this sentiment. So too does their willingness to defend him even as he had done things like lob unfounded accusations of pedophilia at a cave diver and threaten to pull Tesla workers stock options if they unionized. That said loyalty from actual employees makes sense according to Ben White senior director of talent strategies at Titus Talent a recruiting and coaching company. Hes a pretty impressive person that is accomplishing a lot with amazing missions that are meaningful said White who has interviewed many Tesla engineers in the process of making his YouTube video How to crush your Tesla interview. The video addresses how to answer the following question You are standing on the surface of the Earth. You walk one mile north one mile west and one mile north. You end up exactly where you started. Where are you Answer North Pole. Tesla and SpaceX engineers have told White that part of what they love about their jobs beyond the opportunity to work with the best and brightest anywhere is that it feels so missiondriven. He questioned whether Twitter would have the same pull. I dont know if the free speech mission is as powerful a mission as lets get to another planet or lets save this planet by reducing emissions he said. I reached out to Ben Price 39 because halfway through the companys employee purge he shared that he had applied to Twitter tagging elonmusk. Five days later a similar tweet from one of the most famous hackers in the world would succeed in getting Musks attention. George Hotz who made headlines as a teen for becoming the first person to jailbreak Apples iPhone proposed taking an internship at Twitter. Musk responded Sure lets talk. With Price here was a man with no obvious history of public stunts who was eager to share with the world that he wanted to join Twitter. Why What surprised me when we spoke on the phone was Prices blas attitude toward Musk. He didnt adore the man. Nor did he abhor him. Honestly I dont have strong feelings about him said Price who is a fraud specialist focused on employment matters in Oregon. He says crazy things. I think everyone says crazy stuff at a certain point said Price who is a registered Democrat. His decision to apply was not particularly personal Improving anything is fun and doing it with the greatest free speech platform to date seemed exciting he said. So Price went to the Twitter careers site. There just past a blownup tweet by an employee raving about her colleagues he found an information security engineer job to apply for. As it turns out the employee advertising the joy of working for Twitter had just been laid off. Her photo is yet to be removed from the site. Price is inclined to trust Musks ability to improve a place he said. But ultimately Musk wasnt the one who convinced him that improvements were needed. It was a Twitter whistleblower former security chief Peiter Mudge Zatko who accused the company of failing to protect the platform from exploitation by both employees and foreign agents in July. Reading Zatkos Congressional testimony prompted White to want to help patch things up he said. Perhaps the next applicant would be more of a true fanboy I thought. Nope. Jack Jacob of Chicago also applied in November amid the purge. His timing was mostly pragmatic he told me If employees were bailing on Twitter then there was an opportunity to fill a gap. Hes sick of scraping together money from restaurant jobs and cryptocurrency startups. Ive never had a job with benefits said Jacob who is 27. Musks companies are known for requiring people to go through every single item on their rsum during the interview process. Jacob never got there. And that was OK with him. Though in our initial interview he dismissed Musks inflammatory comments as classic troll behavior a few days later he messaged me that hed done more research and concluded he wouldnt want to work for Musk after all. Part of what convinced him he said was learning that Musk had offered a 250000 settlement to a flight attendant who accused him of exposing himself to her. Musk has claimed that the accusations were politically motivated. He wasnt the only one having a change of heart. On Tuesday Hotz the famous hacker shared that hed decided to quit his Twitter internship. Where were the true loyalists Theyre surely out there. Musks initial Twitter team includes numerous people he brought over from his other companies including 50 Tesla engineers according to CNBC. But the speed at which Musk began violating his own supposed free speech principlessilencing journalists among other hypocritical moveshas made it difficult to publicly defend him. Even one of the most recent additions to Twitters leadership teamDave Chen who came from Googlehas exhibited nonloyalist behavior some sleuthing on LinkedIn reveals. Chen who became the vice president of engineering at Twitter in October according to his LinkedIn profile liked a post criticizing Musk for failing to apologize for the layoffs. Update Dec. 31 2022 Of course one of the best ways to create loyalty is to dangle power in front of someone. On Wednesday following a poll Musk announced that hed be willing to step down from his CEO role at Twitter if he found the right replacement. Among those who are suddenly eager to work at Twitter are rapper Juicy J and Lex Fridman a popular podcaster and A. I. researcher at MIT. It seems that neither will get the job. As of Wednesday afternoon Juicy J was still trying to figure out how to get Musk to DM him. And Musks response to Fridman was less than encouraging. One catch you have to invest your life savings in Twitter and it has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy since May he wrote. Still want the job

15,Machine learning models to accelerate the design of polymeric long-acting injectables,Polymer-based long-acting injectable drugs are a promising therapeutic strategy for chronic diseases. Here the authors use machine learning to inform the data-driven development of advanced drug formulations.,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35343-w,Abstract Longacting injectables are considered one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic diseases as they can afford improved therapeutic efficacy safety and patient compliance. The use of polymer materials in such a drug formulation strategy can offer unparalleled diversity owing to the ability to synthesize materials with a wide range of properties. However the interplay between multiple parameters including the physicochemical properties of the drug and polymer make it very difficult to intuitively predict the performance of these systems. This necessitates the development and characterization of a wide array of formulation candidates through extensive and timeconsuming in vitro experimentation. Machine learning is enabling leapstep advances in a number of fields including drug discovery and materials science. The current study takes a critical step towards datadriven drug formulation development with an emphasis on longacting injectables. Here we show that machine learning algorithms can be used to predict experimental drug release from these advanced drug delivery systems. We also demonstrate that these trained models can be used to guide the design of new long acting injectables. The implementation of the described datadriven approach has the potential to reduce the time and cost associated with drug formulation development. Introduction Longacting injectables LAI are a class of advanced drug delivery systems that are designed to release their cargo over extended periods of time in order to achieve a prolonged therapeutic effect. LAIs that are amenable to parenteral administration can confer several advantages over conventional drug formulations including increased patient compliance and bioavailability of drug 1. Moreover LAIs can be engineered to provide either local e. g. Zilretta or systemic e. g. Lupron Depot drug exposure over a prolonged period making them ideal formulation strategies for the treatment of chronic diseases 2. The unparalleled chemical and physical diversity afforded by these materials makes polymerbased LAIs a particularly apt version of this drug delivery strategy. These systems can be engineered to entrap drugs within a polymer matrix with release occurring via various mechanisms including erosion diffusion or simultaneous erosion and diffusion 3. In addition to achieving sustained or controlled drug release the encapsulation of drugs into these polymeric matrices can often protect therapeutic cargo 4. To date various polymerbased LAI technologies administered via the intramuscular 5 subcutaneous 6 and intraarticular 7 routes have received regulatory approval Fig. 1a. Despite the advantages associated with polymeric LAIs their translation from bench to bedside remains nontrivial. In the past two decades only about 30 polymeric LAI products have received regulatory approval in contrast to the thousands of conventional oral formulations approved in the same period 38. Several pivotal challenges limit the development and clinical translation of polymeric LAIs. Firstly there are few biodegradable polymer materials that are generally recognized as safe GRAS for parenteral administration. To date the polymeric LAIs that have received clinical approval are largely based on a single polymer polylactidecoglycolide PLGA 239. The use of a material such as PLGA with an established safety profile may accelerate the regulatory approval of new LAI formulations. However it is well recognized that drugpolymer compatibility significantly influences the performance of a formulation including drug loading capacity drug release and stability 10. Given that each drug has its own unique physicochemical properties it is unlikely that any one polymer material is ideally suited for the formulation of all drugs. Thus reliance on the relatively small subset of polymeric materials that have GRAS status likely restricts our ability to develop polymerbased LAIs for many classes of drugs. Moreover for a given polymer material there is a wide range of variables that must be optimized during LAI preparation. Furthermore changes to any of these variables have the potential to impact formulation performance and the net effect of such alterations cannot be known a priori. Often initially promising formulations can fail at various stages during development due to unwanted drug release rates making their reformulation and reevaluation necessary Fig. 1b. This trialanderrorbased approach represents a significant bottleneck in LAI development 11. To date several strategies have been investigated to inform decisionmaking and expedite the drug formulation development process. For instance mathematical models have been used to describe and greatly enhance our understanding of drug release mechanisms 12. However the application of these empirical models is limited to post hoc analysis of the in vitro drug release profiles of LAIs and they do not offer information on in vitro drug release from LAIs a priori. More recently molecular dynamics simulations have been investigated 13. These techniques have been useful in quantifying links between drug release rates and formulation parameters including particle size and drug loading levels 14. While the development of these techniques is an active area of research molecular scale simulations of entire drug delivery systems are computationally intensive. These approaches can be used to confer useful information on potential LAI systems however they cannot currently be used in place of experimental drug release assays 14. Several studies have also investigated machine learning ML approaches 11. The application of ML in the pharmaceutical sciences is generally limited by a lack of available opensource datasets to train models 11. Past efforts to predict in vitro drug release from LAIs using ML have exclusively considered neural network NN based models and have examined narrow application domains. For example Szlk et al. used NNs to predict the drug release of proteins and peptides from PLGAbased microparticles MPs using a dataset of 68 PLGA formulations extracted from the literature 15. Small molecule studies have also employed NNs to predict drug release and these have generally been limited to less than 20 data instances 16. The use of NNs for supervised learning tasks in the lowdata regime may be associated with an increased risk of overfitting compared to alternative ML algorithms such as treebased models or Gaussian processes which are usually better suited for sparse data problems. The current study pursued the investigation and refinement of ML models for accurate prediction of fractional drug release from polymeric LAIs Fig. 1c. To achieve this we trained and evaluated a series of eleven different ML algorithms including multiple linear regression MLR MLR with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularization lasso partial least squares PLS decision tree DT random forest RF light gradient boosting machine LGBM extreme gradient boosting XGB natural gradient boosting NGB support vector regressor SVR knearest neighbors kNN and NN. The LGBM model was found to have the best performance predicting fractional drug release with a high degree of accuracy. Results and discussion Model selection The dataset used to train ML models was constructed from previously published studies by our group and other research groups 1017181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344. The studies performed by our group included spherical and cylindershaped polymeric LAIs 101838. Data from external sources were identified using the Web of Science search engine and the keyword combination polymeric microparticle and drug delivery 1719202122232425262728293031323334353637394041424344. In each research article selected for dataset construction the in vitro release of the drug from the respective formulation was characterized. The final dataset was composed of descriptors for a range of small molecule drugs polymer materials and LAIs as well as the in vitro drug release profiles and experimental conditions under which the drug release profiles were generated. In total this included 181 drug release profiles with 3783 individual fractional release measurements for 43 unique drugpolymer combinations. The LAIs were mostly formed from commercially available polymers such as PLGA polylactic acid PLA and polycaprolactone PCL of various molecular weights and lactidetoglycolide ratios for PLGA systems. A visual representation of the fractional drug release profiles for all formulations within the collected dataset is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. A summary of this dataset in terms of drugpolymer combinations is included in Supplementary Fig. 2. Seventeen molecular and physicochemical descriptors were initially selected based on domain knowledge as input features to describe the LAI formulations of the various ML models. This included input features that described the physicochemical properties of the drug polymer and LAI system and features that accounted for experimental conditions under which the in vitro release studies were conducted. As shown in Supplementary Table 1 the models were trained in such a way that for each drug release profile for a specific LAI only the input feature the timepoint for drug release measurements Time varied with all other input features remaining constant. These included the drugs molecular weight DrugMW topical polar surface area DrugTSPA number of heteroatoms DrugNHA melting temperature DrugTm acid dissociation constant DrugpKa and calculated partition coefficient DrugLogP as well as polymer molecular weight PolymerMW molar crosslinking ratio CLRatio and lactidetoglycolide ratio LAGA the drug loading capacity of the LAI expressed as a fraction DLC the initial drugtopolymer ratio used to prepare the LAIs Initial DM ratio the surface areatovolume ratio of the LAI SAV the percent of surfactant in the experimental release media SE fractional drug release at 6 h T 0. 25 fractional drug release at 12 h T 0. 5 and fractional drug release at 24 h T 1. 0. The selected panel of ML models was trained and evaluated using a nested crossvalidation strategy that included an inner loop i. e. model training and hyperparameter tuning and an outer loop i. e. model evaluation. Briefly for each ML model 20 of the drugpolymer groups in the dataset were randomly selected as a test set. The remaining 80 were used for model development. Within the inner loop each model was subject to a hyperparameter optimization procedure using group kfold k 10 crossvalidation. Model hyperparameters were tuned using a random grid search where the objective function was the average model performance across these kfold groups of drugpolymer combinations. The range of model hyperparameters considered as well as the final selected values are shown in Supplementary Tables 28. Following the selection of the best hyperparameters within the inner loop the model was then evaluated on the test set within the outer loop. This nested crossvalidation strategy was implemented ten times for each ML model to determine the average model performance across randomly generated test sets. This crossvalidation strategy resulted in some overlap for specific drugs between the inner and outer loops as well as a similar overlap for specific polymers. However grouping by drugpolymer combination ensured that there were no specific LAI systems i. e. drugpolymer combinations present in both the trainingvalidation i. e. inner loop and test i. e. outer loop sets thus allowing for crossvalidation against drugpolymer based splits. In all cases model performance was assessed using mean absolute error MAE the average absolute difference between predicted and experimental fractional drug release values. The overall predictive performance of each ML model on the inner i. e. trainingvalidation and outer i. e. test nested crossvalidation loops are summarized in Table 1. The results obtained for each individual trial for all models are also shown in Supplementary Tables 912. Overall the predictive performance of the outer loop largely reflected the respective accuracies found in the inner loop indicating good model fitting. Specifically the treebased ML models were on average more accurate MAE 0. 16 than the linear instancebased and deep learning models investigated. This is consistent with a recent study demonstrating that treebased models remain stateoftheart for mediumsized datasets 10 K samples 45. The LGBM model had the highest overall prediction accuracy with MAE values of 0. 125 0. 039 and 0. 114 0. 036 obtained for the inner and outer loops respectively. Considering the MAE values across the various nested crossvalidation trials the performance of the LGBM model appeared to be closely matched by RF NGB and XGB models. To better illustrate the performance of these models the absolute error values generated for all predictions across the ten nested crossvalidation trials are summarized in Fig. 2. While the mean values for the LGBM RF NGB and XGB models are close the deviation of absolute error values varied between these forestbased models. Overall the LGBM model afforded the most narrow distribution in absolute error values for the test data. There was found to be a statistically significant difference between the absolute error values generated by the LGBM model compared to the other models p 0. 05. Thus the LGBM model was selected for further development. For comparison we also trained and evaluated a series of ML models without any initial drug release measurements included as input features i. e. without the features T 0. 25 T 0. 5 and T 0. 1. Models that include initial experimental measurements as input are referred to as fewshot models and models without such inputs are referred to as zeroshot models. Fewshot models necessitate the measurement of the first few experimental points before the predictions can be performed however the result is often a more accurate model. In this study it was found that the addition of initial drug release measurements i. e. fewshot models resulted in better performance than the corresponding models without these features Supplementary Tables 913 and Supplementary Fig. 3. Model refinement When trained using the 17 input features mentioned above the LGBM model was identified as the most accurate at predicting fractional drug release. In general input feature sets for ML models should be comprehensive and encode all relevant physical information to make accurate predictions. The use of too many possibly irrelevant features can increase the risk of introducing spurious correlations between individual features and observed release profiles which can eventually degrade the models generalizability. Thus the 17feature LGBM model was assessed refined and optimized through agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis to identify potentially redundant input features. The input features were arranged into a hierarchy of clusters using the farthest neighbor clustering algorithm Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4. With this approach strong correlations were observed between the input features DrugNHA DrugTPSA and DrugMw 0. 94 with DrugNHA and DrugTPSA displaying the strongest correlation 0. 99. A similar cluster of strong correlations was observed between T 0. 5 T 0. 25 and T 1. 0 0. 92 with T 0. 5 and T 1. 0 displaying the strongest correlation 0. 97. Thus there was some redundancy between the 17 features. The performance of the LGBM model was then assessed following the removal of select feature clusters based on their linkage distances Table 2 and Supplementary Table 14. The optimal version of the LGBM model was determined to be the model that could achieve the lowest MAE while minimizing the number of features. This was identified to be a 15feature LGBM model that did not include DrugNHA or T 0. 5. Interestingly despite the strong correlation between DrugTPSA and DrugMw as well as between T 0. 5 and T 1. 0 it was found that the removal of any additional feature clusters resulted in a reduction in model accuracy Table 2. In the case of DrugNHA and DrugTPSA both values were generated by RDKit based on SMILES codes and these predictions may be incorrect and therefore irrelevant to the final model. For the T 0. 5 and T 1. 0 features there may not be a sufficient number of fractional drug release values with meaningful differences at these time points. This final 15feature LGBM model was then analyzed and deployed in a prospective study. To confirm that suitable hyperparameters were selected for the 15feature LGBM the nested crossvalidation strategy was conducted again with this reduced number of input features. The performance was consistent with that of the 17feature model while the resulting hyperparameter configuration differed slightly. Model interpretation To illustrate the predicted fractional drug release profiles generated by the trained LGBM model test set drugpolymer combinations were extracted from the nested crossvalidation and plotted against their respective experimental drug release profiles Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 5. Figure 4a shows the predicted and experimental drug release profiles for select LAIs from the dataset. Overall there was good agreement between the predicted and experimental drug release profiles. The importance of the various input features in generating such fractional drug release predictions was then determined via Shapley additive explanation SHAP analysis of the final 15feature LGBM model. Figure 4b shows the global contribution of each feature in terms of SHAP values. In Fig. 4b the input features are arranged from top to bottom in order of decreasing the impact on model output. Time is listed in the top row indicating that it had the greatest impact on the fractional drug release predictions. In addition each row of the swarm plot in Fig. 4b also depicts an individual dot plot with each dot representing a separate instance in the dataset. Blue dots indicate lower values for that feature in the dataset while pink dots represent higher values. For example blue dots in the Time row represent low values for drug release timepoints while pink dots in the PolymerMW row represent instances for LAIs composed of polymers with higher molecular weights in the dataset. The distance between an individual dot and the gray vertical central line reflects the extent to which that fractional drug release value deviates from the mean value of the initial dataset. For example lower Time values i. e. blue dots in the Time row Fig. 4b resulted in a strong negative contribution to fractional drug release while higher Time values i. e. pink dots in the Time row Fig. 4b resulted in a strong positive contribution. After Time the next most influential features were T 1. 0 DrugMw and PolymerMW. T 1. 0 was observed to have a similar relative contribution to fractional drug release as Time. Specifically lower values of T 1. 0 resulted in a strong negative contribution to fractional drug release while higher values resulted in a strong positive contribution. Interestingly two of the most important features are descriptors of the physicochemical properties of the drug and polymer i. e. DrugMw and PolymerMW. This indicates that of the components of the LAI system the LGBM model has recognized that the molecular weight of the drug and the molecular weight of the polymer has the most significant influence on fractional drug release. The remaining molecular and physicochemical descriptors appear to have minimal contribution to fractional drug release prediction for this model. However it should be noted that Fig. 4b only shows the effect of each individual feature and does not account for potential synergy between input features. Moreover we know from the agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis Fig. 3 that a reduction in any of the remaining features has a negative impact on the performance of the model. The decision path function from the SHAP library was utilized to better visualize the collective effect of the 15 input features on model outputs. This type of analysis highlights the combined effect of the input features and allows for individual data instances to be followed and interpreted. Figure 5 illustrates how the LGBM model determines fractional drug release predictions using a single LAI formulation from the dataset. 5FUPLGA index 84 in the attached dataset is a spherical MP 30 m formulation of fluorouracil LG 5050 Mw 104 kDa with a DLC of 18 wt. Figure 5a shows a visual comparison of the experimental and predicted fractional drug release values for 5FUPLGA index 84 in the attached dataset and highlights three arbitrary prediction instances i Time 0 days predicted fractional drug release i. e. f x 0. 01 ii Time simeq7 days f x 0. 61 and iii Time 20 days f x 0. 82. Figure 5b shows the decision path for each of the predicted fractional drug release values. Each prediction begins at the base value for the model and migrates through the LGBM model based on the contributions of each input feature. Figure 5c shows a breakdown of the exact contribution of each input feature on the prediction of fractional drug release for the three highlighted data instances as SHAP force plots. In Fig. 5c the relative values of each input feature are shown by a pink positive or blue negative band on the force plot with the width of this band representing the numerical contribution to the final model output. The contributions of each input feature are summed with the base value of the model to derive the model output. Prospective study Utilizing SHAP analysis allowed us to establish the importance ranking of the 15feature LGBM model Fig. 4 and to better understand their combined contributions in generating fractional drug release predictions Fig. 5. This analysis also revealed that the input features which had the greatest influence on the fractional drug release predictions were Time and T 1. 0. While these are certainly features that reflect the performance of an LAI they are not known by formulation scientists a priori. This information only becomes available once the LAIs have been prepared and characterized. However the importance of Time and T 1. 0 to the model is intuitive given that Time is the only feature of the model that varies for a given LAI system. T 1. 0 provides the model with fractional drug release values after one day and could be considered a proxy for the initial drug release rate. For instance low values of T 1. 0 are likely to be indicative of sustained release profiles compared to LAIs with high fractional drug release at T 1. 0. Thus using T 1. 0 as a proxy for initial drug release rates might inform the design attributes of new LAIs. We were interested in determining the impact of input features that are more easily manipulatable by formulation scientists e. g. drug properties polymer types LAI morphology etc.. To investigate this we used a simple unsupervised clustering approach i. e. Tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding tSNE to group the input features of the LGBM model by their respective SHAP values Supplementary Fig. 6. With the assumption that lower drug release values at T 1. 0 are indicative of an LAI that provides sustained drug release and vice versa it is possible to identify other features of the LAI systems that are correlated with low values of T 1. 0. This was done by highlighting relative feature values in the lowdimensional cluster map of the dataset and comparing across features. Select examples of T 1. 0 CLRatio PolymerMW and DrugMw are shown in Fig. 6. This information can be used to guide the design of new LAI systems. As a starting point we focused on the design of PLGAbased MPs. PLGA was selected for the preparation of the formulations due to its commercial availability including a wide range of molecular weights relatively straightforward methodology for MP production compared to crosslinked systems and widespread use in commercially available LAI products 8. Thus our design criteria were immediately limited to systems with CLratio values equal to zero to exclude any of the crosslinked particles or cylinders in the collected dataset. This subset of the dataset can be seen by the pink circles i. e. low values in the CL Ratio subplot of Fig. 6. Following this subset of the data to the other subplots it was noted that certain feature values were loosely associated with drug release at T 1. 0 and therefore indicative of whether an LAI would release drug faster or slower. For instance mediumhigh values for PolymerMW mediumhigh values for DrugMw and lowtomedium values of DLC were generally associated with low values for T 1. 0 for the PLGA LAIs. While lower values for PolymerMW low values for DrugMw and low values for DLC were generally associated with high values for T 1. 0 for the PLGA LAIs. These trends are further highlighted in Supplementary Fig. 7 with the inclusion of an expanded series of input features. Thus based on this analysis we devised a table of key design criteria for PLGA MPs Table 3. It should be noted that the relative values for these features are constrained to the values described in the initial dataset that was used to train and evaluate the model. Based on the results of the SHAP analysis we proceeded to prepare and characterize two separate LAIs which fulfilled the design criteria identified for fastrelease and slowrelease PLGA formulations Table 3. Specifically for the fast release LAI which required a relatively low PolymerMW a 10 kDa PLGA was selected. While for the slow release LAI which required a mediumtohigh PolymerMW a 50 kDa PLGA was selected. The drugs to be encapsulated in the respective polymers were selected based on two criteria i physicochemical properties in the range determined by SHAP analysis and ii exclusion from the dataset used to train the model. Specifically salicylic acid SA was selected as the drug for the fast release PLGA formulation due to its relatively low values for DrugMw 138. 12 gmol DrugTPSA 57. 53 DrugpKa 1. 79 DruglogP 1. 09 and DrugTm 159. 6 C. Olaparib OLA was selected for the slow release PLGAbased formulation due to its relatively high values for DrugMw 434. 47 gmol DrugTPSA 86. 37 DrugpKa 9. 96 DruglogP 2. 35 and DrugTm 208. 5 C. The LAIs were then prepared using a wellestablished emulsionbased method at drugtomaterial ratios such that the values for DLC and Initial D M ratio were within the LGBM models design criteria for the fast and slow release formulations. Specifically the DLC was 0. 1 for the fast release formulation and 0. 2 for the slow release formulation. For both the fast and slow systems the values obtained for SAV are indicative of spherical particle morphologies. However the slow release LAIs had some medium dataset values thus the OLAPLGA system was prepared with a larger particle size than the SAPLGA. The physicochemical properties of the OLAPLGA and SAPLGA LAIs are summarized in Supplementary Table 15. The average particle size of the MPs was determined using laser diffraction particle size analysis and the morphology was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy Supplementary Fig. 8. Once prepared and characterized the in vitro release profiles of drugs from the LAIs were evaluated in 0. 5 wt SDS and the resulting experimental release profiles were compared with the LGBM model predictions. The results of this prospective study are shown in Fig. 7 Supplementary Fig. 9. Overall there was good agreement between the predicted and experimental release profiles for both the fast and slow release PLGA systems. However it was noted that the experimental release of OLAPLGA increased significantly after day 15 compared to the predicted release profile. This increase in experimental release rate is most likely the result of PLGA hydrolysis in the release media which is known to result in a change in release rate 46. This highlights the need for more data on slowrelease PLGAbased formulations andor integration of information related to the timedependent hydrolysis of PLGA into the model. Despite this potential limitation of the current model the results for the OLAPLGA system are promising. OLA is a poly ADP ribose polymerase PARP inhibitor that is commercially approved Lynparza for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer metastatic prostate cancer metastatic pancreatic cancer and early or metastatic breast cancer 47. The recommended dose of Lynparza is 300 mg two 150 mg tablets taken orally twice a day and treatment continues until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed 48. Thus OLA is an example of a therapeutic agent that could potentially benefit from the formulation as an LAI. While it remains to be seen if additional optimization is required to arrive at a version of OLAPLGA that is efficacious in vivo the deployment of the LGBM model here has directed the design of an LAI OLAPLGA with significant potential. In summary cuttingedge ML technologies are now freely available to pharmaceutical and materials scientists. The results obtained in this study demonstrate the potential for ML to expedite the development of innovative drugdelivery technologies. Among the strengths of modern ML techniques are their ability to provide insights into how models reach their predictions. Herein we demonstrate that ML models can not only be used to predict in vitro drug release from LAIs with a high degree of accuracy but also that interpretation of such models can be used to guide the design of new formulation candidates. In the current study we found that for this dataset the treebased LGBM model provided the most accurate prediction of fractional drug release. Given the small size of the dataset 4000 observations and that most of the data points contain variables that are properties of the drug or polymer it is perhaps not surprising that the neural network models investigated did not perform well. As the use of ML in drug formulation development increases we anticipate that larger datasets will become available leading to an increase in the utility of neural networks. In the meantime the implementation of treebased models such as LGBM has the potential to reduce the time and cost associated with the development of LAI formulations. For instance the datadriven approach used here directs the design of a promising LAI for the drug olaparib OLAPLGA. However it remains to be seen if additional optimization is required to arrive at a version of OLAPLGA that is efficacious in vivo. Overall these results demonstrate a promising application of ML in drug formulation development. It is our hope that this proofofconcept study and its associated dataset will aid in fostering the development of more advanced tailored and accurate ML approaches for the design of new drug formulations. Methods Machine learning Data collection The dataset was constructed from previously published studies by our group and other research groups 1017181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344. The studies performed by our group include spherical and cylindershaped polymeric LAIs 101838. Data from external sources were identified using the Web of Science search engine and the keyword combination polymeric microparticle and drug delivery 1719202122232425262728293031323334353637394041424344. Information related to the preparation final composition and release kinetics of drugs from LAIs was collected. The latter was primarily extracted from figures of in vitro drug release profiles using the GetData Graph Digitizer application. The final dataset contained 181 drug release profiles for 43 unique drugpolymer combinations. In total this comprised 3783 individual fractional release measurements. The initially collected dataset was composed of a table of drug and polymer names as well as physicochemical properties of the formulation and fractional drug release values at various timepoints. In order to use this data to construct and train ML models it is necessary to describe various elements using machinereadable descriptors which were generated using RDkit. The polymers and LAI formulations were described exclusively using information reported in the relevant published articles these included polymerMW LAGA for nonPLGA systems this was set as zero molecular CLRatio for noncrosslinked systems this was set as zero initial D M ratio DLC SAV ratio for the LAI system fractional drug release at 6 h T 0. 25 fractional drug release at 12 h T 0. 5 fractional drug release at 24 h T 1. 0 and the percent of surfactant present in the release media SE where no surfactant was present in the release media this was set as zero. With the exception of SAV T 0. 25 T 0. 5 and T 1. 0 the 17 input features were either extracted from original publications or calculated using the RDkit package. SAV was constructed and implemented for this study as it confers information that is related to the size and shape of the LAI system. This enables the inclusion of both spherical and cylindricalshaped LAIs in one model. For studies wherein values for fractional drug release were not available at early timepoints i. e. T 0. 25 T 0. 5 and T 1. 0 they were imputed using bestfit polynomial curves that range from T 0 to T 2 days. Data splitting strategy for ML model training ML models were trained and evaluated using a nested crossvalidation approach. The nested crossvalidation approach consisted of an inner training and validation and outer test loop. To implement the nested crossvalidation approach the collected dataset was grouped by drugpolymer combinations 43 unique drugpolymer combinations in total to allow crossvalidation against drugpolymer based splits. For each ML model ten trials of the nested crossvalidation method were conducted to assess the general performance of each algorithm. For each implementation of the nested crossvalidation method 20 of the drugpolymer groups in the dataset were randomly held back for evaluation using the groupshufflesplit method from the Scikitlearn library in Python 49. The remaining 80 of the drugpolymer groups were then used for hyperparameter selection of models in the inner loop. This was done using the random grid search method from the Scikitlearn library in Python 49 with 100 random hyperparameter configurations being assessed in each case. Within the inner loop data were again grouped and split by drugpolymer combination using the Group kfold crossvalidation strategy from the Scikitlearn library in Python 49 where k 10. Thus 10 of the drugpolymer groups within the inner loop were used for hyperparameter evaluation while the other 90 were employed to train the various model architectures selected using the random grid search method. The outer loop was used to test the performance of the model structure i. e. fixed hyperparameters selected by the inner loop using a holdout dataset i. e. 20 of the drugpolymer combinations in the initial dataset. ML model development In total eleven ML algorithms were trained and investigated for this task. These included MLR lasso PLS DT RF LGBM XGB NGB SVR kNN and NN models. All of these models were built and evaluated in Python. NN models were built using the Keras package with the backend of TensorFlow 50 LGBM models were built using the lightGBM package 51 XGB models were built using the XGBoost package 52 NGB models were implemented using the NGBoost package 53 and all other models were built using the Scikit learn library 49. In all cases prior to training any of the ML models a data preprocessing step was conducted to standardize the data prior to input into the ML models. This was done using the standard scalar package available in the Scikit learn library 49. ML model hyperparameters were tuned using the randomized grid search package in Scikit learn 49 and the negative mean absolute error metric was employed. ML model evaluation To assess the predictive performance of all trained ML models the predictions for each outer loop n 10 split from the nested crossvalidation were compiled into a data frame for analysis. This amounted to 8000 data samples and enabled a more quantitative evaluation of general prediction accuracy for each model. This was done by determining the absolute error AE for each prediction made for each sample in each of the ten outer loops. The AE and MAE were determined using the equations shown below Where hatyi is the predicted fraction drug release value y is the experimental fractional drug release value obtained from either the training or external validation datasets i nis the total number of data points. Feature engineering Agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using the hierarchical clustering package from SciPy in Python 54 to arrange the initial input features into a hierarchy of clusters using the farthest neighbor clustering algorithm. The performance of the optimal ML algorithm LGBM was then assessed following the removal of select clusters based on their linkage distance. Here the hyperparameter structure for the LGBM model identified during preliminary screening i. e. nested crossvalidation was utilized and only the number of input features was varied. Model interpretation SHAP analysis was conducted on the trained 15feature LGBM model. The effect of the various input features on the fractional drug release prediction for the initial dataset was assessed using the TreeSHAP package and the force plot visualizations from the SHAP library in Python 5556. Principal component analysis Dimensionality reduction was necessary to better visualize the impact of the model input features on initial drug release values. We used tSNE to cluster the input features of the LGBM model by their respective SHAP values. To employ the tSNE algorithm we first utilized PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the 15feature LGBM dataset into two principal components.

Acetonitrile ACN HPLC grade and formic acid FA LCMS grade were purchased from Fisher Chemical ON CA. Dichloromethane DCM HPLC grade and methanol HPLC grade were purchased from Caledon Laboratories Ltd. ON CA. Olaparib OLA 99 was purchased from MedKoo Bioscience NC US. Phosphate buffered saline PBS Gibco pH 7. 4 was purchased from Thermofisher Massachusetts USA. Tween 80 reagent grade was purchased from BioShop ON CA. Formulation preparation PLGA MPs were prepared based on a modified version of a previously reported oilinwater ow emulsion method 25. For OLA MPs 300 mg of RG 504 H and 200 mg of OLA were dissolved in 6 mL of a solvent mixture DCMDMSO 5050 vv in a 20 mL scintillation vial to produce the organic phase. The organic phase was then emulsified in 200 mL of MilliQ water 0. 01 wt PVA previously cooled to 4 C using a homogenizer L5MA Lab Mixer Silverson MA US at 1500 rpm for 30 min. After homogenization the emulsion was added to 500 mL of MilliQ water without PVA previously cooled to 4 C and stirred at 500 rpm for 60 min. The MPs were then filtered using a 100 m cell strainer Fisherbrand Sterile Cell Strainers ON CA followed by a 70 m cell strainer Fisherbrand Sterile Cell Strainers ON CA to retain the MPs within the size cutoff i. e. 70100 m. MPs were then collected and frozen at 80 C for 30 min prior to lyophilization overnight. For SA MPs 300 mg of RG 502 H and 150 mg of SA were dissolved in 4 mL of a solvent mixture DCMDMSO 7525 vv in a 20 mL scintillation vial to produce the organic phase. SA MPs were then formulated as described for the OLA MP formulation except for the filtration step where 70 m and 40 m cell strainers Fisherbrand Sterile Cell Strainers ON CA were utilized to retain the MPs with diameters ranging from 40 to 70 m. Size measurement Measurements of particle size were conducted via laser diffraction using a Mastersizer 300 Malvern ON CA equipped with a Hydro SV accessory. For both OLA and SA MPs around 510 mg of lyophilized MPs were suspended in 100 L of MilliQ water with 0. 2 wt Tween 80. The 100 L MP suspensions were then added to the system for evaluation. Morphology The morphologies of lyophilized OLA and SA MPs were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy SEM Quanta FEG 250 ESEM at the Centre for Nanostructure Imaging at the University of Toronto. Drug loading analysis To evaluate drug loading 10 mg of lyophilized MPs were weighed and the drug was extracted using 4 mL of a DCMDMSO solvent mixture 5050 for OLA and 7525 for SA vv in a 20 mL scintillation vial. This solution was then vortexed until the MPs were fully dissolved in the solvent. Following this the resulting solution was filtered 0. 45 m MillexHV PVDF Syringe Filters Sigma Aldrich CA and appropriately diluted in methanol prior to drug quantification via highperformance liquid chromatography HPLC. HPLC analysis of OLA and SA was performed using an Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity II Agilent Technologies Santa Clara CA USA with a photodiode array PDA detector and an XDBC18 column 4. 6 150 mm ZORBAX Eclipse Agilent. The mobile phase was composed of MilliQ waterACN 7030 wt with 0. 1 wt FA and the flow rate was 1. 2 mLmin. OLA and SA were analyzed at wavelengths of 254 nm and 303 nm respectively. The experimental drug loading capacity i. e. DLC was calculated as follows Drug solubility in the release media To ensure the in vitro drug release studies were conducted under sink conditions the solubility of the drug in the release media PBS with 0. 5 wt SDS was measured. Specifically an excess amount of drug 10 mg of OLA and 30 mg of SA was added to 5 mL of release media i. e. PBS with 0. 5 Tween in scintillation vials. The scintillation vials were incubated at 37 C with gentle stirring 50100 rpm overnight followed by filtration using a filter membrane 0. 45 m MillexHV PVDF Syringe Filters Sigma Aldrich CA. The drug concentrations were then quantified using HPLC as described in the previous section. Drug release assay To characterize the in vitro drug release profiles 810 mg of OLA MPs corresponding to 2. 5 mg of drug and 2040 mg of SA MPs corresponding to 0. 5 mg of drug were weighed for each release assay. The MPs were then suspended in centrifuge tubes 15 mL Corning Sigma Aldrich CA containing 15 mL of release media. The tubes were incubated at 37 C with gentle mixing using a tube shaker Labquake Fisher Scientific. At predetermined timepoints the release samples were centrifuged at 45 g for 3 min to pellet MPs at the bottom of the tube. Aliquots 1 mL of the supernatant were analyzed the remaining media was discarded and fresh release media 15 mL was added to each tube to ensure sink conditions. Drug release was quantified using HPLC as previously described. Fractional drug release was calculated as follows Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

17,The Haunted’s Ola Englund Opposes Overproduced Metal: “It’s Supposed to Hurt”,"He also calls himself and Nergal ""old farts.""
The post The Haunted’s Ola Englund Opposes Overproduced Metal: “It’s Supposed to Hurt” appeared first on MetalSucks.",https://www.metalsucks.net/2023/01/09/the-haunteds-ola-englund-opposes-overproduced-metal-its-supposed-to-hurt/,The Haunteds Ola Englund Opposes Overproduced Metal Its Supposed to Hurt Extreme metals favorite peanut gallery is chattering again after The Haunted guitarist and guitar Youtuber Ola Englund weighed in on recent comments made by Behemoth frontman Nergal that heavy music today is too overproduced and sanitized. Last week Nergal said These days you can fucking perfect things to the point that you cannot fucking listen to it because the perfection makes things boring imperfect and a whole lot uninteresting. Live its not perfect thats why its so fucking exciting. So why make things that are just so fucking polished I dont get it especially in extreme metal music. Its gotta be fucking weird its gotta be dangerous. Where is the danger factor So I really wanted to bring the danger factor back to our music. It was present but maybe this is the record where its the most present ever. Englund weighed in on his Youtube channel pointing out that he and Nergal are from a time in recording technology where a band had to already be tight before the studio since they couldnt rely on ProTools and other editing software. Metal news magazines online can quote me on this one when I say that these are the words of an old metal fart just like me. I absolutely agree with what hes saying right here. I grew up on albums that were not recorded on a computer where bands had to really perform well really know their music before they even hit the studio. And you know they would just perfect their craft and get a real live groove happening on an album. Im used to that I bet that Nergal is also used to that. Nowadays when you hear death metal bands that have 240 BPM per minute songs and its just a grid of kicks and snares and perfectly synced guitars it is a little bit weird. It does sound robotic. Still he acknowledges that some people just like that sound but emphasizes his belief that things arent supposed to be total clean theres supposed to be a level of abrasiveness to the music. But thats the thing about music the newer generation that grew up and started listening to metal later theyre used to this. Maybe thats a sound they like this completely robotic supertight kind of sound. So I guess its really subjective. A guy like me and a guy like Nergal we like when stuff is grooving. Ive said this a bunch of times but I like to leave mistakes in albums because its the mistakes and the grooves that make an album unique. I see Nergal is getting a lot of shit for his statement right here. But to some extent I kind of agree with him. I can still enjoy a really good modern death metal band where everything is robotic that has its own flavor to it. But I personally like to hear when a band is playing you know off the top of their lungs and you can almost hear the wheels coming off a little bit. You know its supposed to hurt. A lot of things are polished today and it doesnt hurt. It doesnt hurt the ear. I like when it hurts if that makes sense.
