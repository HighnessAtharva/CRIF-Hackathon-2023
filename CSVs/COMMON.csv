But Mattels allmale teams refused and gave him a crotch as smooth as Barbies she said. Ken would have had much more of a bulge if Barbies creator got her way. Ruth Handler who introduced the plastic doll to the world in 1959 wanted to give Barbie a boyfriend. So two years later Mattel started selling Ken named for Handlers son Kenneth. When we went about designing Ken I felt that he needed what we all primly referred to in those days as a bulge Handler wrote in her autobiography Dream Doll published in 1994. Both the allmale design and marketing staffs however disagreed so the groin on the first Ken doll was as smooth as Barbies. Handler saw herself as ahead of her time arguing that there should at least be a bulge that would suggest realism Robin Gerber wrote in Barbie and Ruth her 2000 biography of Handler. Cy Schneider a Mattel advertising exec wrote in his 1987 book Childrens Television The Art the Business and how it Works that company staff werent sure how explicit to make Ken. They worried that adding genitalia would cause some mothers to object but omitting it could cause the dolls to look like some wounded Hemingway hero he wrote. When designing the dolls under the Barbie brand Mattel consulted Ernest Dichter a psychologist and marketing expert with a specialism in Freudian psychoanalytic concepts. He pointed out the primary play mode for the Barbie and Ken dolls was dressing and undressing them wrote Schneider. He questioned whether children would understand that Ken was a boyfriend or comprehend what a boyfriend really was. Would they see Ken as their fathers brothers or the boy next door And if so was it healthy to see him undressed And when he was naked why did he or didnt he look like Daddy or a brother At Mattel a storm raged over his genitalia M. G. Lords wrote in her 1994 book Forever Barbie The Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll with Handler and Barbie clothing designer Charlotte Johnson fighting for a doll with a noticeable crotch and the other male execs fighting against it. After a male doll with the same completely smooth crotch as Barbie had been vetoed by Handler and Johnson three new versions were were sculpted with varying degrees of bumps Lord wrote. The men especially one of the vice presidents were terribly embarrassed Lord quoted Johnson as saying. After Handler and Johnson picked the middle one the vice president said he would never have it in the toy line unless we painted Jockey shorts over it Johnson told Lord. Ruth felt the design team lacked the guts to give the Ken doll even the suggestion of male sex organs Gerber wrote. Despite ordering prototypes with varying degrees of bulge in the crotch the male designers resisted all but the barest hint of a penis. Instead of having a recognizable penis underwear was painted on the nearly flat surface of Kens genital area and buttocks Gerber wrote. Lord wrote that Handler had never wanted a doll with a penis showing. If the child took off the swimsuit we felt it would be inappropriate with an adult boy to show the penis so we all reached a conclusion that he should have a permanent swimsuit Lord quoted Handler as saying. No curious little girl would ever be able to remove his underwear Schneider wrote. But Johnson disagreed per Lords book. Do you know what every little girl in this country is going to do it quoted Johnson as saying. They are going to sit there and scratch that paint off to see whats under it. What else would they do Lord wrote that ultimately the men reluctantly agreed and decided to give Ken a bump. I had to work with the sculptor a little bit Johnson said per the book because I realized when we were putting zippers in the fly and the zipper on top of that bump it got bigger and bigger. But this didnt work out anyway. Somehow in the manufacturing process in Japan one of the engineering supervisors determined that molding on the shorts was too difficult and that the lump added about a cent and a half worth of plastic to the plastic of the product so he arbitrarily eliminated both Schneider wrote. Instead the first Ken to be released on the market came with a greatly smoothedover crotch which contrasted with his clearlydefined buttocks. His two legs were created as separate moveable pieces. No underwear was painted on him but he came with a small pair of red swim shorts to cover his dignity. The first Barbie on sale came with swimwear too a zebrastriped swimsuit. Like Barbie the original Ken was available in both blonde and brunette. Mattel was careful to give him boyish cleancut looks and the overall nonthreatening asexual appearance of a wimpy little jerk Schneider wrote. His androgynous looks and his lack of sexual equipment immediately became a hot internal issue. Handler wrote that he did get a little bump as time went by but not before our son took a lot of teasing at school. Gerber similarly wrote that Handlers son resented the flatcrotched doll that bore his name. Much like Barbie Ken has evolved over the years. Towards the end of the sixties Ken got a hunkier build a handsomer face longer hair and a healthier skin tone Handler wrote in her autobiography. While people had remarked that our earlier wimpier Ken looked a lot like Dwayne Hickman of Dobie Gillis fame the Ken of the late 1960s was decidedly more Warren Beattyish. Since then dozens of reincarnations of the doll have been released. Recent versions have included long hair different body types and varying skin tones. Barbies voluptuous figure initially put buyers off One of the major debates among Mattel execs during Barbies development in the 1950s was how to shape her figure. A major inspiration behind her appearance was Bild Lilli a character who first appeared in comic strips published by the German tabloid paper Bild Zeitung and was turned into plastic dolls from 1955 with a heartshaped face high blonde ponytail and sharp red pout. Handler had already known she wanted to create an adult doll for young girls to play with and in her autobiography she praised Lilli for the breasts the small waist the long tapered legs. Little girls dream of being curvaceous dreamy exciting Handler once said per Gerber. They want some day to have gorgeous clothes be chic and look like movie stars. Handler also enlisted Dichters help in exploring attitudes towards Barbie. After interviewing 191 girls and 45 mothers he suggested enlarging the dolls breasts but also downplaying her sexual overtones to appeal to mothers per Gerber. At the 1959 Toy Fair in New York where Barbie and her voluptuous figure were unveiled to the world buyers were put off by Barbies breasts Handler wrote. Demand for the doll didnt pick up until later that summer. Barbie always followed the trends she didnt create them Handler wrote in her autobiography. And her figure typified what the feminine ideal was in the late 1950s. Even back then however we were getting criticism about Barbies big boobs. But Ruth was not political or prone to dwell on the root of cultural standards Gerber wrote. If girls were being told they should wish they were busty blonds Mattel would profit from that message. Ruth had no interest time or patience for debates over the political or social impact of products Gerber continued. She had hired Ernest Dichter to tell her how to sell the most Barbie dolls not how to make the doll a proxy for an emerging feminist version of women. Perhaps Kens anatomy would not have been such an important consideration had it not been for the fact that Barbies breasts were so fundamental to her appeal Schneider wrote. Barbies prominent breasts are still the lightning rod for controversy the quandary over Ken was what Mattel gingerly referred to as the bulge or bump sociologist Steven Dubin wrote in The Barbie Chronicles in 1999. Over the decades Barbies figure has been the subject of countless debates with critics arguing that she creates unrealistic beauty standards that could harm the dolls young owners. Mattel has launched a range of diverse dolls including some with wheelchairs with vitiligo and in a number of different body shapes.

4,First 'Barbie' teaser trailer parodies Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey',"Warner Bros. releases the first ""Barbie"" trailer in a nod to Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""",https://www.space.com/barbie-trailer-2001-space-odyssey-homage,Barbie Mattels iconic doll franchise and science fiction are rarely uttered in the same breath. But thanks to a clever new trailer for next summers 100 million liveaction Barbie movie those two worlds have just collided. Warner Bros. Pictures recently released the first Barbie teaser opens in new tab and its definitely The Ultimate Trip with a spoton homage to the famous Dawn of Man opening from director Stanley Kubricks immortal 1968 classic 2001 A Space Odyssey. Instead of a band of prehistoric apes having a revelatory moment in the presence of a mysterious black monolith young girls playing with oldfashioned baby dolls are spurred to abandon their vintage toys when a towering statuesque Barbie Margot Robbie appears in high heels and a bathing suit. Related Barbie and Space Exploration Her Astronaut Looks in Photos Its a fun nod to Kubricks existential masterpiece and the films inciting incident depicting the evolutionary nudge of intelligent apes as the dramatic strains of Strauss Also Sprach Zarathustra rise to a crescendo. This time instead of a tribe of hominids its composed with an inspired kid smashing her doll and rebelliously tossing it into the air ala Moonwatcher and his animal bone that transitioned into a millionyear cut to an orbiting weapons platform. This isnt the first time Barbie has encountered outer space before as a Barbie astronaut doll was created in 1965 during NASAs Gemini program then in 2019 Mattel paid tribute to the first American woman in space with a Sally Ride doll as part of their Barbie Inspiring Women Series and a pair of Mattels Space Discovery dolls took an orbital trip to the ISS earlier this year in conjunction with the Mission DreamStar STEM outreach program. Mattel has also created Barbie dolls of European astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti and Russian cosmonaut Anna Kikina. Directed by Greta Gerwig Warner Bros. Barbie stars Robbie as the famous Mattel doll and Ryan Gosling as her tanned boyfriend Ken in a candycolored kingdom. Early plot details have revealed that when Ken and Barbie leave their idyllic home for the real world Mattel CEO Will Ferrell chases after them to get the plastic pair back to pinkpainted Barbieland. Barbie arrives in theaters on July 21 2023. Follow us on Twitter Spacedotcom opens in new tab or on.,2022-12-21T15:00:26Z
5,All the brand new pop culture we canâ€™t wait for in 2023 | The Guide,"Greta Gerwigâ€™s Barbie, the return of My Bloody Valentine and a genuinely real film called Cocaine Bear are among the TV, film and music you should get to knowMuch like that Terryâ€™s Chocolate Orange youâ€™ve been picking at since Boxing Day, 2022 is almost gone.â€¦",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/30/the-guide-tar-cocaine-bear-the-last-of-us,Much like that Terrys Chocolate Orange youve been picking at since Boxing Day 2022 is almost gone. But here comes another year with a load of new pop culture to gorge on. To get you suitably prepped Ive picked a few of the TV series films and albums Im particularly excited about. Ive avoided sequels prequels and the like instead focusing on brand spanking new shows and films along with some returning bands and artists. Of course theres no castiron guarantee that all of the below will actually be released in the next 12 months one of The Guides hot picks for 2022 was Martin Scorseses Killers of the Flower Moon a film that is now not expected to be released until late 2023 but hopefully it should provide a tantalising glimpse of some very good culture coming our way soon. Film Tr An absolutely volcanic Oscartipped performance by Cate Blanchett anchors this muchadmired psychological thriller. Blanchett plays Lydia Tr a renowned Berlinbased conductor drawn into a messy MeToo controversy on the eve of a landmark performance. The film has tons to say about cancel culture and the licence we give brilliant people to behave badly but its never judgmental or didactic just perceptive and nailbitingly tense. US out now UK 13 Jan Aus 26 Jan Blue Jean Given how many people it affected there are strangely few films about Section 28 the Thatcher governments law preventing the promotion of homosexuality in schools and local authorities. This drama which led the nominations at the British Independent Film Awards is welcome then following a closeted PE teacher Rosy McEwen who finds herself drawn into a nonsexual but still dangerous relationship with a student. UK 10 Feb US and Aus TBC Cocaine Bear The internet has been besotted by this horror comedy inspired by the true story of an American black bear who devoured his way through a duffel bag of chisel ever since it was announced last year. But things really went up a notch last month with the release of the trailer which promises the wildest of trips. Its cast including Keri Russell OShea Jackson Jr Alden Ehrenreich and in one of his final performances Ray Liotta is strong enough to suggest this will be more than just Bmovie silliness though hopefully there will be plenty of that too. UK and US 24 Feb Aus TBC Barbie The Lego Movie proved that cynical movietoy tieins can also be pretty entertaining so we can be cautiously optimistic about this comedy based on Mattels planetconquering platinumhaired doll. Particularly as it has Greta Gerwig directing her first two efforts in the chair Lady Bird and Little Women have been complete knockouts. The cast is pretty spectacular Margot Robbie as Barbie above Ryan Gosling as Ken and a supporting lineup that includes Simu Liu Emma Mackey Michael Cera and Issa Rae. Aus 20 July UK and US 21 July Oppenheimer Christopher Nolans first biopic was never going to be a small affair so its little surprise that hes chosen the father of the atomic bomb himself Robert Oppenheimer as its subject. Longtime Nolan collaborator Cillian Murphy plays the theoretical physicist in a film that in true Nolan style forgoes the CGI for real life stunts including remarkably the recreation of a nuclear explosion. Unlikely to be a quiet night at the multiplex this one. UK and US 21 July Aus TBC Music Young Fathers Heavy Heavy Since the release of their Mercurywinning 2014 debut Dead Young Fathers above have built a formidable reputation as one of the countrys most unpredictable bands melding together soul punk glitchy electro and anything else they fancy. Perhaps the most unpredictable thing about their last album Cocoa Sugar was how pleasingly melodic it was albeit in a skewed Young Fathers way. This followup seems to promise more of that tunefulness married with a backtobasics threeblokesinabasement studio approach. 3 Feb Kelela Raven The Washington DC singers 2017 album Take Me Apart seemed to herald an exciting new voice in RB futurefacing but unquestionably warm and emotionally unguarded. Since then nothing Kelela seemed to fall off the face of the earth. After conquering selfdoubt and writers block she finally returns in 2023 with an album that sees her sound evolve as she adds a political sharpness to her lyrics. Its good to have her back. 10 Feb Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Land of Sleeper Have I just included this because its fun to write the word pigs seven times in a row No actually Pigs x7 as theyre often abbreviated are one of the UKs most reliably riffy rock bands serving up a noxious slew of barroom blues and thick sludgy metal. Their fourth album promises more of the same only somehow faster and more unpleasant anchored by the anguished howls of Matt Baty one of the most engaging frontmen in the business. 17 Feb Everything But the Girl Title TBC Reunions are ten a penny these days LCD Soundsystem seem to embark on one every other year but heres a comeback that feels genuinely major. Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt have been on an extended hiatus for the entirety of the 21st century but recently announced that an album is in the offing. No word on its name release date or what it will sound like but you could imagine their refreshingly icy minimalist electronica slotting well into current trends. TBC My Bloody Valentine Title TBC I included the long awaited new album from Kevin Shields and pals last year and 12 months on zilch. But this year TBC this year will be the one where the shoegaze titans return. I feel it in my bones. We know nothing about it of course but we can probably guess that Shields will suddenly drop it at midnight as he did with m b v. in 2012 So keep en eye out or alternatively just come back here in 12 months time when I may be making the same doomed prediction again. TV Kaleidoscope Netflix 1 Jan Netflix Hollywoods archdisrupters already changed how you watch TV. Now they want to disrupt the order in which you watch it. This Ridley Scott produced heist drama about a group of thieves attempting to crack the planets most unbreakable vault is intended to be viewed in whatever sequence you please with episodes set both before and after the heist itself. Netflix are calling Kaleidoscope a nonlinear streaming experience if they pull it off the results could be spectacular. The Last of Us Yet another zombie drama And a zombie drama adapted from a video game to boot Both are fair justifications for not being excited about this new series. However when that video game was one of the most acclaimed of all time raising the medium to new levels of emotional complexity it seems likely to rise above the surfeit of similar shows. The steady hand of HBO and showrunner Craig Mazin who did such a fine job with Chernobyl should ensure that none of that is lost here. Plus the cast Pedro Pascal Bella Ramsey Murray Bartlett Nick Offerman is pretty eyecatching. 15 Jan HBO US 16 Jan Sky Atlantic UK Everyone Else Burns The Righteous Gemstones seems to have the market on satirising fire and brimstone types sewn up in the US but what about the UK This C4 comedy stars Simon Bird complete with preposterous bowl cut hairdo above as the patriarch of an ultrareligious Christian family convinced that the end times are imminent. The trailer promises a broad and antic sitcom with some exciting comic talents involved Morgana Robinson Liam Williams and Lolly Adefope. January Channel 4 UK TBC US and Aus Fleischman is in Trouble Taffy BrodesserAkners novel AKA the book everyone you knew was reading in the first lockdown gets a prestige TV adaptation with another knockout cast. Jesse Eisenberg is the recently divorced Manhattanite attempting to balance parenting with his newfound zeal for dating apps Claire Danes is his missing exwife and Lizzy Caplan plays the best friendnarrator figure. If its half as unputdownable as the source material then it will surely be among the years best. 22 Feb Disney UK out now FX US Masters of the Air Having been in the offing for the best part of a decade this followup to Band of Brothers and The Pacific looks finally set to air in 2023. As youll have twigged from the title its focus is the exploits of a second world war United States air force division and like its predecessors the cast is stocked with every promising young male actor going including Austin Butler and Barry Keoghan. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg once again execproduce. Apple TV TBC Bonus Returning shows to be excited about While we might be focusing on the shiny and new here we couldnt in good conscience press send on this newsletter without mentioning a handful of the televisual big beasts returning in 2023. As early as Sunday you can watch one of them Happy Valley is back for its final series seven years after the last one. ITVs own crime drama mainstay Unforgotten returns for series five its first without Nicola Walker. Theres no returning show more intensely anticipated than Succession the Roys return in the spring for more of the superrich Sturm und Drang. And if rumours are to be believed there are three new episodes of Line of Duty coming down the pipe too. Now were sucking diesel,2022-12-30T11:45:47Z

7,10 Comedies We Canâ€™t Wait to See in 2023,"Margot Robbie plays Barbie. Chris Rock takes to the stage. Pete Davidson makes a show inspired by his own life. Here are the funny movies, series and happenings to look forward to this year",https://www.cracked.com/article_36511_10-comedies-we-cant-wait-to-see-in-2023.html,10 Comedies We Cant Wait to See in 2023 Who knows what the new year will have in store for us But at least we can take a little comfort in mapping out some potentially great comedies coming our way. From highly anticipated standup specials to amusing summer blockbusters to the return of beloved cult series 2023 has a little bit of everything on tap. In alphabetical order lets highlight the 10 most promising prospects Barbie July 21st Amidst all the summers highprofile event movies the latest Mission Impossible Christopher Nolans somber Oppenheimer perhaps the film thats most intriguing is about a Mattel doll. Yes Barbie will star Margot Robbie as the iconic toy who goes on an epic quest with Ryan Gosling playing Ken. Will Ferrell Issa Rae Michael Cera and America Ferrera are also part of the ensemble. Warner Bros. has kept the plot mostly secret letting the movies ultracolorful look and starry cast serve as the selling points. Thats more than enough to get us hooked plus the films directed and cowritten by Greta Gerwig responsible for the Oscarwinning Lady Bird. If this hits Barbie could be one of the years funniest and most delightful films. Lord knows Gerwigs already more than halfway there You couldnt have asked for a better Barbie and Ken. Beef TBD Ali Wong has delivered a series of great recent standup specials not to mention costarring in and cowriting the 2019 romcom Always Be My Maybe. Her next project will be a little darker though Shell be in Beef with Steven Yeun playing characters who according to Variety let a road rage incident burrow into their minds and slowly consume their every thought and action. The Netflix series was created by Lee Sung Jin a writer on Dave who was Emmynominated for his work on Silicon Valley. Beef is described as a comedydrama so its hard to know for sure how outright funny itll be. Still the involvement of Wong and Yeun who was hilarious in last years Nope suggests theres going to be room for humor in what certainly sounds like an intense premise. Bupkis TBD Youd better not be tired of Pete Davidson because hes not going anywhere. The current Taco Bell pitchman and permanent tabloid fixture has demonstrated hes a solid actor thanks to films like The King of Staten Island and now hell be starring in his own series. Premiering on Peacock later this year Bupkis was described in Deadline as a heightened fictionalized version of Davidsons real life. The series will combine grounded storytelling with absurd elements from the unfiltered and completely original worldview for which Pete is well known. Davidson who also cowrote the series is joined by some heavy hitters including Edie Falco as his mom and Joe Pesci as his grandfather. If that wasnt enough Charlie Day Brad Garrett Ray Romano and Kenan Thompson are also putting in appearances. Bupkis has been rumored to be Curbesque and theres no denying Davidson has fashioned a popular persona that will draw viewers. The question is whether hell be able to carry a whole show. Chris Rock Selective Outrage March 4th Perhaps you heard that Chris Rock had a memorable 2022. Ever since being the recipient of The Slap at last years Oscars the comedian has been busy touring very occasionally referencing his altercation with Will Smith. So expectations are high that hell finally make his most public comments during Selective Outrage his new Netflix standup special which is the streaming platforms first live special. He remains a titan of the form with his last special Tamborine appearing on Netflix five years ago. But even those with only a passing interest in Rock will want to tune in Who wouldnt be curious to hear what Rock has to say nearly a year after he and Smith tangled Clone High TBD Before Phil Lord and Christopher Miller became famous as the guys who brought 21 Jump Street to the big screen or masterminded The Lego Movie they were buddies in college hatching the idea for a series that was a riff on teen dramas such as Dawsons Creek except it was about the clones of historical figures. In the early 2000s with the help of Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence the shortlived Clone High became a reality finding a cult audience before getting axed. But in November after years of hinting at a revamp Lord announced that a new season of Clone High will be coming out in 2023 through HBO Max. No word yet on when exactly well see the show but hopefully Will Forte and the rest of the original voice cast will be back for this revival. Mrs. American Pie TBD Bridesmaids Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar demonstrated her ability to be deeply weird. Tonally where will Mrs. American Pie reside Based on the Juliet McDaniel beachread novel this Apple TV series is set in the early 1970s when havenot Maxine Wiig tries to enter the world of uppercrust Palm Beach society. Billed as a story about gorgeously impossible people this comedy miniseries will be executiveproduced by Laura Dern whos going to costar alongside Allison Janney Ricky Martin and Carol Burnett. Thats an eclectic cast and the hope is that Mrs. American Pie gives Wiig a Big Little Liesesque vehicle albeit without the dead bodies we assume. Next Goal Wins September 22th Taika Waititi has become comedy royalty in recent years directing the smash Thor Ragnarok and then winning an Oscar for his Hitler satire Jojo Rabbit. Even if last years Thor Love and Thunder was a disappointment his involvement with the wellreviewed Our Flag Means Death only continued his hit streak. He returns in 2023 with this underdog sports comedy based on actual events In the buildup to the 2014 World Cup the pitiful American Samoa soccer team hired an unconventional coach Thomas Rongen to turn their fortunes around. Based on the documentary of the same name Next Goal Wins stars Oscarnominee Michael Fassbender and definitely looks like the kind of crowdpleasing sports comedy that audiences cant get enough of. Its basically the Cool Runnings of soccer is how Waititi described it which may be all the enticement viewers need. Party Down February 24 Its been 13 years since a new episode of Party Down aired and in that time the Starz series stature has only grown with several of its cast members going on to bigger starrier roles. Naturally theres been a steady drumbeat from hardcore fans hoping for a revival ever since which always leaves me with mixed feelings. Sure it would be great to get more Party Down but sometimes a shows magic is hard to replicate even if you bring everyone back. Look no further than Arrested Development The later seasons had their moments but time had passed and the special alchemy wasnt quite there anymore. Nonetheless lets be optimistic that Adam Scott and his costars will prove us wrong reviving that dreary catering company and its miserable employees the shows wit and lowkey poignancy still intact. Ted Lasso TBD The second season of Ted Lasso ended with some cliffhangers but the real suspense has taken place since the Emmywinning comedydrama stopped airing new episodes in late 2021. Production delays kept the third season from debuting in 2022 as was initially expected and then theres the question of whether this will be the shows final season. I think the only person who can give an answer is Jason Sudeikis costar Jeremy Swift said recently. And I dont think even he knows. Plus theres been the added drama of the very public end of Sudeikis relationship to actordirector Olivia Wilde which has grabbed headlines for some of the silliest reasons. All of that speculation and gossip only adds more pressure to a show already facing huge expectations. Love or hate Ted Lasso it became a zeitgeisty sensation. Can Season Three continue to build on that momentum And if this is the end will Ted Lasso go out as triumphantly as it came in You Hurt My Feelings TBD In 2013 writerdirector Nicole Holofcener released Enough Said a sweet funny sad romcom for adults which starred Julia LouisDreyfus and James Gandolfini as divorced single parents who decide to start dating. Ten years later Holofcener reunites with the former Seinfeld star for a film that has a killer premise. LouisDreyfus plays Beth a writer whos been working on her latest novel for years encouraged by her loving husband Don Tobias Menzies but then one day she accidentally overhears Don admitting to someone that actually he thinks her book isnt very good. Billed as a comedy about insecurity and narcissism You Hurt My Feelings should strike a chord with anyone whos had to lie in a relationship to protect their partners feelings or conversely discovered that their soulmate hasnt always been truthful with them. The movie premieres at Sundance with A24 releasing later this year. LouisDreyfus so rarely makes films so its exciting to see what she brings to the role. If its not good though I promise not to tell her what I really think.,2023-01-06T01:00:00Z
8,Happy new year: will cinema finally cheer up in 2023?,"After the sour, teary family dramas of 2022, this yearâ€™s schedule presents some sweeter cinematic confectionery that suggests plain old fun at the movies might be back in fashion<ul><li>More cultural highlights of 2023</li><li>The top 50 films of 2022</li></uâ€¦",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/30/happy-new-year-will-cinema-finally-cheer-up-in-2023,Cinema last year was a tangle of family angst. Films conceived and shot in lockdown leaned hard on small casts and big tears. The best movie of 2022 Charlotte Wellss Aftersun about a final fatherdaughter holiday was one example. So too more surprisingly was the biggest box office performer of the year Top Gun Maverick the story of a middleaged teacher trying to patch things up with his quasison. Some of 2023s early offerings those dramas jostling for awards contention fall into this bracket The Whale The Son The Fabelmans Empire of Light. All are tales of dysfunction and domestic betrayal and for the last two at least hangovers of the 2020 worry that cinemas might shut forever. But peer further into the schedules and the landscape looks different. The horizons widen and the colour palette perks up. Its possible to imagine seeing three films in a row that dont all leave you a sobbing wreck. And this is because as Covid concerns waned a little lockdowns lifted and the end of the world began looking marginally less imminent so studios gained the confidence to greenlight movies a bit more upbeat. Wonka is one such film. Paul Kings followup to Paddington 2 stars Timothe Chalamet as a youthful incarnation of the chocolatier in an origin story about which little is known something about how he first met the Oompa Loompas but much is hoped. Olivia Colman who also stars along with assorted Paddington graduates such as Sally Hawkins Matt Lucas and Simon Farnaby who again cowrites said in an interview earlier this month that the film is such a treat and its star is magical and so beautiful. The Divine Comedys Neil Hannon has written original songs for the film and Simon Rich a very funny New Yorker humorist has punched up the script. Even Wonka or Chalamet skeptics will have a hard time doubting this one after all everyone was dreading Paddington after ominous early posters and trailers but Kings aesthetic cheery precisely composed tweeembracing but emotionally authentic was so winning the movie took nearly 300m and breathed new life into the UK family film industry. One director to whom King has often doffed his souwester is Wes Anderson himself prepping another Roald Dahl adaptation The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Anderson will this summer also serve up a grand slice of Technicolor confectionery with Asteroid City. It is set during a Junior Stargazer convention held in a fictional American desert town the premise and madly stacked ensemble cast make Moonrise Kingdom comparisons hard to avoid. Anderson regulars Jason Schwartzman Tilda Swinton Adrien Brody Jeff Goldblum Jarvis Cocker Jeffrey Wright and Edward Norton are joined by newbies Margot Robbie Rupert Friend Matt Dillon Bryan Cranston Tom Hanks and Steve Carell. Robbie also stars in another DayGlo US indie adventure out next July Barbie the eagerly awaited Mattel adaptation written and directed by Greta Gerwig. Shots of Robbie and Ryan Gosling one of many Kens in the movie rollerblading in vivid pink spandex and wildly white smiles sent the internet into spasms of ecstasy and revisionist thinking last summer. Elsewhere there are signs that fripperies and plain old fun are back in fashion after two years of slog and sadness. Channing Tatum is oiling up once again to drop his kecks for Magic Mikes Last Dance while Jennifer Lawrence moves on from brain tumour drama Causeway to Rrated comedy No Hard Feelings in which she plays a woman who answers a Craigslist ad placed by a mother who wants her son to lose his virginity before college. Even Luca Guadagnino of Bones and All and Call Me By Your Name is getting in on the act directing of all things a US sports comedy starring Zendaya. Cannibals are being traded for cheerleaders. Little women for beaming dollies. Lets hope real life can keep pace.,2022-12-30T13:00:49Z
9,"Simu Liu: â€˜Barbieâ€™ Will Dismantle â€˜Blonde, Whiteâ€™ Stereotypical Doll Beauty Standards","""Itâ€™s really about finding your inner beauty and owning that part of yourself and being the best possible version of you,"" Liu said of the upcoming Mattel-produced film.",https://www.indiewire.com/2023/01/simu-liu-barbie-will-dismantle-blonde-white-doll-stereotypes-1234795521/,Simu Liu promises Barbie will shed the stereotypical beauty standards longperpetuated by doll brands. The upcoming film cowritten by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken and while the duo complete with Goslings bleachblond locks are the textbook images of Mattelmade perfection they are just two of the many many versions of Barbies and Kens in the Barbie universe. Kate McKinnon America Ferrera Will Ferrell Issa Rae Michael Cera Kingsley BenAdir Ncuti Gatwa Hari Nef Nicola Coughlan and Emerald Fennell also are among the massive ensemble cast. I remember very clearly about some of our big intricate dance sequences Greta was very very conscientious about who she cast. We were able to cast people of different shapes sizes differently abled to all participate in this dance all under this message of You dont have to be blonde white or X Y Z in order to embody what it means to be a Barbie or a Ken Liu said during the 2022 Unforgettable Gala honoring Asian artists and leaders in the entertainment industry via Vanity Fair. According to Liu the film is really about finding your inner beauty and owning that part of yourself and being the best possible version of you. I will say going on set I was never isolated. I felt like I was going to work every day with a cast that really celebrated each other and celebrated each others differences no matter where we came from Liu said of working with Oscar nominee Gerwig. I think when you watch the movie youll see that reflected on the screen. Director Gerwig previously revealed that she at first thought taking on a Barbie film would be a careerender but gushed that Mattel proved to be an amazing partner during production. They have given us such trust and such freedom and I think that is incredibly rare the Little Women helmer said during an episode of Dua Lipas At Your Service podcast.

10,"10 Of The Biggest Box Office Gambles Of 2023, From Barbie To Cocaine Bear","The return to normalcy (or at least something resembling normalcy) at the box office after the hell that was 2020 has been slower than expected. But things looked very promising in 2022 and, if we're lucky, 2023 will take us even further in the right directioâ€¦",https://www.slashfilm.com/1156394/10-of-the-biggest-box-office-gambles-of-2023-from-barbie-to-cocaine-bear/,10 Of The Biggest Box Office Gambles Of 2023 From Barbie To Cocaine Bear The return to normalcy or at least something resembling normalcy at the box office after the hell that was 2020 has been slower than expected. But things looked very promising in 2022 and if were lucky 2023 will take us even further in the right direction. Yes weve absolutely got a stacked slate of seemingly sure things such as AntMan and the Wasp Quantumania Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom Creed III Transformers Rise of the Beasts and The Nun 2 amongst many others. Weve also got some promising originals such as Christopher Nolans Oppenheimer and Taika Waititis Next Goal Wins. But there are also a number of movies coming our way this year that yes have their merits but also feel like they could go very hard one way or the other. Is a cheaplymade horror movie about Winnie the Pooh actually capable of bringing people to theaters en masse Do people like Willy Wonka and Timothee Chalamet enough together to deliver blockbuster numbers Does Jurassic World have a monopoly on dinosaurs These are some of the burning questions were here to mull over as we go over ten of the biggest box office question marks for 2023. Lets dig in. 80 for Brady Tom Brady is without a doubt the most successful person to ever put on a uniform in the NFL ever. But even though the man refuses to retire well into his 40s the day will come when he has to hang up the helmet and undoubtedly Hollywood will come calling. Well that has already started a bit in earnest and this years 80 for Brady aims to see if his good name can carry a motion picture into the box office equivalent of the end zone. Can this be a bestcasescenario for a sports movie like The Blind Side 309 million or more like Uncle Drew 46 million Outside of the Rocky franchise sports movies are a little all over the place and a tough thing to bet on. The film hails from Paramount Pictures who crushed it in 2022 with an allstar cast that includes Jane Fonda Sally Field Rita Morena Lily Tomlin and yes Brady himself. The story is based on a reallife tale of four best friends who embark on a trip to see their hero Tom Brady play in the 2017 Super Bowl. The question is can Bradys name get moviegoers in seats And more to the point can the likes of Fonda and Field be draws for slightly older audiences to help cement this as a hit While budget figures havent been revealed yet it does appear as though Paramount didnt overspend on this one. Well see if Bradys got a promising career in the movie business come February 3. Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey Ah the ageold question can internet hype actually lead to meaningful ticket sales Few things caught on in the movie news world last year quite like Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey an ultralowbudget slasher that is based on the beloved A. A. Milne characters made possible by his early works entering the public domain recently. Once social media caught wind of the first images it spread like wildfire. Ultimately it paved the way for some reshoots and amazingly enough a fullblown theatrical release on February 15. Written and directed by Rhys FrakeWaterfield the lowbudget producer is about to see if he can turn some public domain goods into gold. The movie got so much attention online that Fathom Events has even partnered with Jagged Edge Productions on the release. But is this really something people are going to pay to go see in a meaningful way Given its incredibly low budget the stakes are low here. But if it can somehow break through and become a hit It would be a pretty remarkable moment cementing that IP and horror are the two gateways that lead to success when executed correctly. Cocaine Bear Again we find ourselves in a situation where a premise or merely a title for that matter was enough to send the internet into a frenzy. With Elizabeth Banks behind the camera Universal Pictures believes they have a winner with Cocaine Bear a wild actioncomedy that is amazingly enough inspired by a true story about a bear that ate a bunch of cocaine left in the woods by drug smugglers. Im no marketing expert but for my money between the trailer and the poster thus far the studio has done a tremendous job of getting the word out on this one. People seem excited. But again can that online excitement actually translate to getting people off the couch The truly big question mark here is just how much Universal spent on this thing. That could be the deciding factor. If they managed to keep the budget below 50 million I would guess they have a real shot at turning this into a profitable venture assuming the reviews are not devastatingly bad. If it somehow climbed to 75 million or so The path to profitability becomes far more narrow as it would probably need to do Ghostbusters Afterlife numbers 204 million to be considered a success. This is by no means a sure thing but it has breakout potential written all over it. The movie is currently slated to hit theaters on February 24. Dungeons and Dragons Honor Among Thieves Dungeons and Dragons has endured in popular culture for decades now but it has never quite managed to go mainstream in a blockbuster for the masses sort of way. Hollywood has tried to bring the popular game to screen before but those attempts left much to be desired. But now Paramount Pictures is making a bigbudget bet on the franchise with Dungeons and Dragons Honor Among Thieves from Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley aka the guys behind Game Night. Now theyre moving into the blockbuster movie realm and not to apply the pressure here but the stakes are pretty high. While the budget hasnt been disclosed were talking a bare minimum of 100 million spent before marketing if not much more. That means Paramount is hoping for a great many people to turn up to see Chris Pine Rege Jean Page and Michelle Rodriguez in an epic fantasy adventure. But will the availability of House of the Dragon and Rings of Power on streaming make people feel like they can get dragons swords and sorcery at home Or will that only encourage them to scratch that itch a little harder with a trip to the movies Fantasy can be brutal for studios with Seventh Son 114 million box office110 million budget serving as an example of a big ol whoopsie doodle. But at its highest end Theres the 2. 9 billion made by The Lord of the Rings trilogy that Hollywood has chased from time to time over the last two decades or so. If this works Paramount could have a new franchise for years to come. If it doesnt Much money is at stake. Look for it in theaters on March 3. 65 Dinosaurs are not an intellectual property that anyone owns. Yet for whatever reason the Jurassic Park franchise has pretty much been the only one cashing in on the prehistoric creatures for going on three decades now. And that has worked out quite well to the tune of 6 billion worldwide thus far. So why on Earth havent more studios tried to make commercialfriendly dinosaur movies Well Sony wised up and let the guys who wrote A Quiet Place do just that with the wild looking 65 a futuristiclooking scifi movie that actually takes place 65 million years ago on Earth and stars Adam Driver. If I may F yes. Setting personal feelings aside Scott Beck and Bryan Woods proved with A Quiet Place that they can blend horror spectacle and character just so with a formula that can make for a huge hit. Can they do it again And more importantly can they do so on a much larger scale The movie comes with a budget said to be in the 90 million range and as we discovered last year that budget seems to be cursed for some reason. Even so if audiences do decide they like Driver and dinosaurs enough to buy a ticket this could be a surprise hit this year. The big problem Its going up directly against Shazam Fury of the Gods on March 17. If that counterprogramming strategy doesnt pay off it could get ugly. Elemental Pixar was at one point one of the most reliable brands in all Hollywood. The kind of studio that could turn an original diverse movie like Coco into an 800 million global hit just a handful of years ago. Now After several of the studios big originals went straight to Disney over the last few years things have changed. Lightyear bombed badly and the studios future as a major theatrical player feels on shaky ground. That makes director Peter Sohns Elemental the latest original from Disney and Pixar a crucial test to see if audiences will actually show up for something not based on one of their preexisting franchises. In an age where originals are struggling Pixar used to be a shining light. If even they cant deliver an original hit Yikes. As is always the case with a big animated movie its expensive. Probably in the 150 million range if not more. That means were looking at something that at the very least probably needs to make 400 million or more to be considered a modest hit. Its been quite some time since an original animated movie has done that dating back to Coco actually. Its genuinely crazy that were at a place where Pixar feels like one of the biggest underdogs on this list but changing consumer habits have led us to that very place. Well see where the chips fall when the movie hits theaters on June 16. Barbie Circling back to things the internet is absolutely hyped about we have Greta Gerwigs Barbie. Hailing from Warner Bros. with a reportedly massive 100 million budget the film will finally bring the popular doll to the big screen in epic fashion. Though if the teaser trailer was anything to go on its not going to be what many people may think. But it does have a ridiculous amount of star power with Margot Robbie in the title role and a huge supporting cast that includes the likes of Ryan Gosling Simu Liu Will Ferrell Kate McKinnon and many more. On paper youve got a stacked Alist cast a proven director and some beloved IP to work with. Its all there. Isnt it I admit I would have liked to see this movie made for a lot less money as youre firmly in blockbuster territory with a number like that. Youre looking at probably having to make at least 300 million globally to even have a chance at breaking even after a surely pricey marketing spend. I struggle to find a good comparison for this movie but maybe The LEGO Movie 468 million is a good bestcasescenario comp In the postpandemic era of moviegoing that is by no means easy to do. But at the same time if this can actually catch on it has the potential to do even bigger numbers as these are global stars with a globally recognized toy at the center of the story. The most damning thing of all is that the film is as it stands set to open directly against Christopher Nolans buzzy bigbudget historical thriller Oppenheimer. Thats not counterprogramming thats a brawl that could leave both opponents injured. This one really feels like a dice roll to me. Look for it in the heart of the summer movie season on July 21. Haunted Mansion This year marks the 20th anniversary of Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl. Its a movie that few thought would work and yet it spawned a multibilliondollar franchise that is still going to this day. Moreover that first film stands out as a truly remarkable example of Atier blockbuster filmmaking. So can Disney once again strike gold by turning a theme park attraction into a feature film That is the question with this years upcoming adaptation of Haunted Mansion. Yes theyve done this before and no it didnt work out very well. But with Justin Simien Dear White People behind the camera and a stacked cast that includes Owen Wilson Jamie Lee Curtis Danny DeVito and Rosario Dawson There are good pieces on the table here. The real question is can Disney cash in on the good name horror has earned in the last few years as one of the only reliable things Hollywood has going for it in the pandemic era And can this wind up closer to Curse of the Black Pearl 654 million rather than Jungle Cruise 220 million It could all come down to reviews and word of mouth and at the moment its impossible to predict how that is going to work out. Disney is going to find out when the movie attempts to scare up big business on August 11. Kraven the Hunter Sony still controls the rights to the SpiderMan franchise and though Spidey himself is still in the Marvel Cinematic Universe thanks to a deal with Disney all of his villains are fair game. As such weve been getting spinoff films such as Venom which proved to be an unexpectedly huge hit. The expansion of this villaincentric corner of the franchise hasnt gone all that smoothly though as last years Morbius was a critical failure and a bomb 167 million75 million budget despite topping the box office in its opening weekend. With that in mind Kraven the Hunter which stars Aaron TaylorJohnson as the famed Spidey villain is a complete tossup. Weve got J. C. Chandor Triple Frontier in the directors chair a supporting cast that includes Russell Crowe and Ariana DeBose amongst others. And yes weve got the Marvel name. But can Sony avoid another critical disaster here Sure the Venom movies have overcome that to the tune of 1. 35 billion combined but bad reviews hurt a lot worse when its a character fewer people in the mainstream are familiar with. Ultimately reviews and a damn good trailer could get Sony back on the right track here. Or if they wind up with another Morbius this franchise expansion could be in need of a dire course correction. Well see what side of the line this one falls on come October 6. Wonka Last but certainly not least we have Warner Bros. Wonka which as the name suggests is another take on the works of Roald Dahl and more specifically serves as a prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It sees Timothee Chalamet as the title character in one of his earlier adventures with Paul King Paddington in the directors chair. The prospects for this one are frankly all over the place and its incredibly tough to imagine where its going to land. For one musicals are not an easy way to make money. Sure La La Land made 447 million against a mere 30 million budget but thats more the exception not the rule. In the Heights also from Warner Bros. more recently topped out at 45 million albeit hampered by the HBO Max release. Then of course theres 2005s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which earned 475 million worldwide which almost certainly is what inspired the studios decision to make the prequel. The point being this could go either way. Either it can do 400 million or more with strong legs in the holiday season against good word of mouth or its IP for the sake of IP that nobody actually cares about. Look for it in theaters on December 15.,2023-01-04T23:00:35Z
