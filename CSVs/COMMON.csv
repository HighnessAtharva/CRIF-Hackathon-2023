This week the company posted a short video on Twitter showing Starship 24 being carefully placed on top of the Super Heavy Booster using Mechazilla located on the rockets launch tower at Starbase in Boca Chica. The 22second clip features an aerial view of Mechazillas Tyrannosaurlike arms lifting Starship 24 to the top of the 469foottall tower 142 meters rotating to the right before placing it on top of the booster. Fully stacked the rocket is around 390 feet tall 120 meters making it the largest rocket ever assembled. The pair have sat on top of one another before including twice in October 2022. They then separated for individual testing. In midDecember SpaceX completed a static fire test of Starship 24 firing up one of its six Raptor engines for seven seconds. Prior the company performed a 14engine static fire test of the booster in November. The booster is equipped with 33 engines but SpaceX has yet to fire them up all up at the same time. Starship 24 is being prepped for the first orbital test flight of the prototype rocket which has already suffered numerous delays. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk recently tweeted We have a real shot at late February. March launch attempt appears highly likely. Musk has been pushing for Starships orbital test flight setting a series of unrealistic timelines in the past year. In June 2022 Musk declared that Starship would be ready for its first orbital flight in July shortly after getting the goahead from the Federal Aviation Administration for the site expansion in Boca Chica. However the company still needs to fulfill an outstanding list of regulatory requirements before Starship 24 can fly and its not yet clear whether or not it has done so. SpaceX also suggested Starship will perform its orbital test flight in November and then later Musk said it would take place in December but the orbital flight was not in the books for 2022. Starships orbital flight will see the heavylift rocket launch to space where it will perform less than a full orbit around Earth and reenter Earths atmosphere. The upper stage will splash down some 62 miles 100 km off the northwest coast of Kauai Hawaii while the Super Heavy booster will come down in the Gulf of Mexico. The booster may also attempt an assisted vertical landing at the launch pad but that hasnt been confirmed. Starship is a fully reusable super heavylift launch vehicle designed to go to Earth orbit the Moon and possibly even further destinations like Mars. SpaceX isnt alone in wanting to see Starship fly NASA is also counting on Starship to land humans on the Moon by 2025 as part of its Artemis 3 mission. Its understandable that SpaceX is ready to see Starship fly on its first orbital trip. In the meantime the company is keeping busy. SpaceX had four rockets on four pads and two Dragons on orbit todayas CRS26 Dragon departed the International Space Station with Crew5 Dragon still attached to the orbiting lab Falcon Heavy rolled out of the hangar two Falcon 9s readied for launch and Ship 24 was stacked onto Booster 7 SpaceX wrote on Twitter. The company enjoyed a lot of success in 2022 and is seemingly setting up for another jampacked year.

2,"Ukraine Secures Funding for an Additional 10,000 Starlink Terminals","Ukraine has reportedly resolved its financial crisis to fund more than 10,000 Starlink terminals provided by SpaceX to combat the Russian invasion that has decimated the country since February. Read more...",https://gizmodo.com/ukraine-starlink-spacex-russia-war-elon-musk-1849918750,Ukraine has reportedly resolved its financial crisis to fund more than 10000 Starlink terminals provided by SpaceX to combat the Russian invasion that has decimated the country since February. Ukraines Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced several European Union countries have agreed to contribute funding toward Starlink terminals which SpaceXs CEO Elon Musk said in October they could not provide indefinitely. Starlink is a satellite project that connects thousands of small satellites in low Earth orbit to ground receivers or terminals to broadcast highspeed internet connections. In October information surfaced that Ukraine and SpaceX the creator of Starlink did not have a concrete arrangement for the country to pay for the Starlink terminals. Ukraine initially received more than 20000 Starlink antennas and earlier this year Musk requested the Starlinks sent to Ukraine be funded by the U. S. Department of Defense. SpaceX reported it was losing roughly 20 million per month and the company said in the letter obtained by CNN We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time. However Musk appeared to change that decision writing on Twitter The hell with it... even though Starlink is still losing money other companies are getting billions of taxpayer well just keep funding Ukraine govt for free. Ukraine has managed to overcome the financial hurdle with the help of other EU countries but Fedorov has not disclosed which countries are contributing toward funding. We are ready to live without electricity for a month with at least mobile network and text messages being available Fedorov told Bloomberg seemingly referencing Russias attacks on Ukraines energy infrastructure. Regarding the internet we have a lot of Starlinks but the key point is we have got a nod for another shipment that will be used to stabilize connection for critical situations he said. The new funding has alleviated some worries in Ukraine and Fedorov told the outlet As of now all financial issues have been resolved. He added that there is no contract in place meaning Ukraine will need to source additional funding by spring 2023. Since the start of Russias invasion in February Ukraine has received 22000 Starlink antennas according to Fedorov and they have been instrumental in countering attacks. Fedorov said Starlinks support was the product of a direct request to Musk on February 24 to rapidly restore communications that had been lost after Russian air attacks. SpaceX and Musk quickly react to problems and help us Fedorov told Bloomberg. Musk assured us he will continue to support Ukraine. When we had a powerful blackout I messaged him on that day and he momentarily reacted and has already delivered some steps. He understands the situation.,2022-12-21T17:55:00Z

NASA said in a media briefing that Russias Roscosmos agency will send an empty Soyuz to the station on February 20th as a replacement for the damaged spacecraft. The vehicle was originally supposed to launch in March. The leaking capsule is expected to return to Earth without a crew sometime in March. It will still carry experiments and other cargo. Cosmonauts Dmitriy Petelin and Sergey Prokopyev as well as NASA astronaut Frank Rubio will now remain in orbit for several months longer rather than departing in March as planned. The affected craft started spraying particles December 14th. The ISS team quickly noticed that an external radiator cooling loop was to blame and investigators later determined that a micrometeoroid struck the radiator. Roscosmos soon decided the Soyuz was too dangerous to use for a standard crew return. Temperatures would have climbed past 100F on reentry threatening both occupants and computer equipment. An inspace repair would be impractical as the procedure would be too difficult according to the agencys Sergei Krikalev. The ISS crew is still prepared to use the broken Soyuz to evacuate in an emergency. However thats not ideal when three of the seven people aboard the ISS would likely have to accept elevated risks to come home. A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule is also docked but it normally only takes four occupants. NASAs ISS program head Joel Montalbano said at the briefing that there had been talks with SpaceX to see if one of the Soyuz passengers could travel aboard the Crew Dragon if necessary. Relations between NASA and Roscomos are strained following Russias invasion of Ukraine. Russia said last summer that it would leave the ISS after 2024 to work on its own space station and the US has been preparing for a possible Russian withdrawal since 2021. However the capsule leak has effectively forced the two to work closely together if only briefly.,2023-01-12T20:53:43Z

6,Elon Musk Updates the Timeline for Starship to Finally Launch to Space - CNET,The most ambitious SpaceX vehicle yet continues to inch closer to leaving the atmosphere.,https://www.cnet.com/science/space/elon-musk-updates-the-timeline-for-starship-to-finally-launch-to-space/,Its been over a year and a half since weve seen a prototype of SpaceXs nextgen Starship spacecraft fly with its first flight with a Super Heavy rocket has been perpetually pushed back during that time. Musk who also currently helms Tesla and Twitter tweeted Saturday that hes hopeful the first orbital flight of Starship could happen as soon as next month. We have a real shot at late February. March launch attempt appears highly likely he wrote. SpaceX launched a series of Starship highaltitude flights in 2020 and 2021 that saw a threeengine version of the spacecraft fly to the stratosphere and come back for a series of landing attempts that all ended in explosions except for the final successful attempt on May 5 2021. Shortly afterward SpaceX announced that it would switch gears to begin producing more Raptor engines testing Super Heavy booster prototypes and preparing for the first orbital launch of Starship. The plan is for Starship to blast off from the companys Starbase facility in Texas atop Super Heavy which will return for a landing on a platform in the Gulf of Mexico after separation while the Starship vehicle continues on for a quick trip to orbit followed by a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Hawaii. The flight plan has been stymied by a number of delays largely tied to the process of getting a launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration. The companys application first had to go through an environmental review process that lasted several months concluding with the agency allowing the mission to go forward but requiring SpaceX to make dozens of modifications to its launch plan. The company still hasnt secured its permit to launch from the FAA as it works through the required changes while simultaneously continuing to manufacture and test Raptor engines and get Super Heavy ready for its first launch. The next Starship flight has been just a month or two away going back to June 2022 when the FAA announced its decision and this latest update continues that pattern. SpaceX isnt the only party with an interest in seeing Starship fly again. NASA has selected it to be one of the vehicles it flies to the moon as part of the Artemis program aiming at returning astronauts to the lunar surface this decade.,2023-01-08T16:55:10Z
7,Elon Musk predicts a US recession next year that might last 18 months — and warns investors to be careful,"The Tesla, Twitter, and SpaceX chief advised investors to take fewer risks, conserve cash, and avoid using borrowed money.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-tesla-recession-stock-market-outlook-fed-margin-debt-2022-12,Elon Musk forecast a US recession next year that could last until the second quarter of 2024. He advised investors to proceed cautiously conserve cash and avoid using borrowed money. Musk has slammed the Feds interestrate hikes as excessive and dangerous to the economy. Elon Musk has predicted a US economic downturn that will last up to 18 months and recommended investors ride it out by conserving cash avoiding debt and taking fewer risks. It does seem like were headed into a recession here in 2023 Musk said during an episode of the AllIn Podcast released on December 24. My best guess is that we have stormy times for a year to a year and a half and then dawn breaks roughly in Q2 2024 he added. The Tesla Twitter and SpaceX CEO noted the severity of the looming recession isnt yet clear but it could rival the slump in 2009 that followed the collapse of the housing bubble. Musk recommended investors brace for hard times ahead by setting aside some cash and making prudent bets without using borrowed money. Hope for the best prepare for the worst the technology billionaire said. Dont get too adventurous. From a cash standpoint keep powder dry. I really advise people to not have margin debt in a volatile stock market he continued. If theres mass panic in the stock market then youve got to really be careful about margin debt. Musk has been pounding the recession alarm in recent weeks and warning the Federal Reserves flurry of interestrate hikes this year have increased the risk of a serious downturn. In response to rapid inflation the US central bank has raised rates from almost zero in March to over 4 today and signaled they could peak above 5 next year. While higher rates can help relieve upward pressure on prices by discouraging spending borrowing and hiring they can also pull down asset prices erode corporate profits and cause the economy to shrink. Still Musk suggested on the podcast that after a largely uninterrupted 14year expansion the US economy is overdue for a recession. Jeff Bezos Amazons founder and executive chairman has offered similar advice to Musk in recent weeks. The ecommerce pioneer also warned of an impending recession and advised Americans to batten down the hatches by taking fewer risks and delaying bigticket purchases to conserve cash.

8,"Elon Musk's SpaceX is launching a $750 million funding round with Andreessen Horowitz that values the company at $137 billion, report says","SpaceX previously allowed shareholders to sell equity at $77 per share, which valued the company at about a $140 billion.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-spacex-valuation-a167-andreessen-horowitz-funding-tesla-twitter-2023-1,Andreessen Horowitz looks set to lead a new SpaceX funding round according to an email it sent to prospective investors CNBC reported. The report said Elon Musks rocket company is eyeing a valuation of 137 billion for the 750 fundraising round. In a prior funding round in July SpaceX was valued at 127 billion. Elon Musks rocket company SpaceX is kicking off a new funding round of 750 million that values the company at 137 billion CNBC reported Monday. The round will likely led by Andreessen Horowitz also known as a16z per an email reviewed by CNBC as the famed venture capital firm reached out to prospective investors. Prior backers for SpaceX include Founders Fund Gigafund Sequoia and others. Over the last 12 months SpaceX raised more than 2 billion including a 250 million funding round in July when it was valued at 127 billion. Bloomberg had reported in December that SpaceX was allowing shareholders to sell equity at 77 per share which valued the company at about a 140 billion. Notably a16z was also a participant in Elon Musks 44 billion Twitter acquisition a deal that some Tesla investors have since lamented. Despite some snags in 2022 SpaceX still notched milestones such as its satellite internet provider Starlink surpassing 1 million subscribers. Musk also facilitated Starlink as an emergency internet provider for Ukraine citizens and soldiers amid the ongoing war with Russia. SpaceX too also had more than 60 reuseable rocket launches last year via its Falcon program. Meanwhile SpaceX launched more astronauts to the International Space Station with NASA eyeing a large role including for a return to the moon.,2023-01-03T14:07:27Z
9,Elon Musk has lost $132 billion in 2022 after Tesla's 68% crash - but that still makes him the world's 2nd richest person,"Elon Musk's most valuable asset is now his equity stake in SpaceX, which is worth an estimated $47 billion, according to Bloomberg.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-net-worth-richest-person-tesla-stock-price-decline-2022-12,Elon Musk has seen more than 130 billion disappear from his net worth in 2022 as Tesla continues to fall. Despite the massive decline in wealth Musk remains the worlds second richest person. Tesla has dropped 68 yeartodate as investors fear Musk might be spread too thin between his different business ventures. The unraveling of Tesla stock has erased 132 billion from Elon Musks net worth in 2022 according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Despite the massive decline Musks 139 billion fortune still makes him the worlds second richest person based on data as of December 23. But the wealth destruction is set to get worse based on Tuesdays trading session for Tesla stock as its near 10 selloff will knock an estimated 7 billion to 8 billion from Musks net worth. That would bring his total yeartodate wealth destruction to about 140 billion. Luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault who is the cofounder and CEO of LVMH is 20 billion richer than Musk and has reclaimed his spot as the worlds richest person. Meanwhile Indian businessman Gautam Adani ranks third in the billionaires index with 110 billion. Musks net worth peaked at just over 300 billion earlier this year. But a 68 yeartodate decline in Tesla stock has erased a large chunk of that as more investors grow concerned about his committement to running the electric vehicle maker while also juggling his other business ventures. Since Musk completed his 44 billion acquisition of Twitter in late October shares of Tesla have dropped 50 compared to just a 3 decline for the Nasdaq 100. Musk has also sold billions of dollars of Tesla stock to fund his acquisition of Twitter. Other factors hurting Tesla stock includes growing concerns of an economic recession in 2023 which would likely put a dent in the companys sales growth and higher interest rates which make growth stocks like Tesla less attractive to investors. According to Bloomberg Musks SpaceX equity stake is now his most valuable asset worth 47 billion. Meanwhile Musks Tesla stake is worth about 40 billion while his options in Tesla are worth another 28 billion according to Bloomberg. The next most valuable asset owned by Musk is Twitter which Bloomberg estimates is worth 20 billion about half Musks purchase price for the social media company. Obviously myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now Musk said in October. Finally Bloomberg assigned a 3. 3 billion value to Musks stake in The Boring Company. While the decline in Tesla stock has erased the biggest chunk of Musks net worth it has created fortunes for those who bet against the company. According to S3 Tesla is the most profitable short of 2022 generating short sellers marktomarket profits of 15 billion.,2022-12-27T19:21:33Z
10,NASA asks SpaceX whether it could return 3 astronauts from the ISS in the event of an emergency following a coolant leak in the Russian spacecraft,NASA asked SpaceX about using the Crew Dragon spacecraft to transport three astronauts back to Earth in case of an emergency with the Soyuz leak.,https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-spacex-return-crew-emergency-leak-russian-spacecraft-2023-1,NASA asks SpaceX whether it could return 3 astronauts from the ISS in the event of an emergency following a coolant leak in the Russian spacecraft NASA has considered SpaceX for a backup plan to return the ISS crew to Earth amid the Soyuz leak. NASA and Russias space agency are investigating the leak which began in December. NASA has reached out to Elon Musks SpaceX to see whether it was capable of returning three crew members from the International Space Station ISS after a docked Russian spacecraft leaked coolant. The American space agency said in a blog post on Friday it had asked about whether SpaceXs Dragon spacecraft had the capability to facilitate the return in the event that an emergency arose. The primary focus was on understanding the postleak capabilities of the Soyuz MS22 spacecraft the agency added. The Soyuz capsule was due to return the three crew members in March after flying them to the ISS on September 21 for a sixmonth mission per NASA. The crew consists of two cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitry Petelin and one American astronaut Frank Rubio. NASA and Russias space agency Roscosmos were working together to investigate the leak and determine the next steps per the agency. We have asked SpaceX a few questions on their capability to return additional crew members on Dragon if necessary but that is not our prime focus at this time a NASA spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters on December 28. NASA and SpaceX didnt immediately respond to Insiders request for comment. The external leak was first detected in the Soyuz capsule when two Roscosmos cosmonauts were preparing to go on a spacewalk NASA said on December 14. Footage shared by NASA in December showed the leak which resembled white particles spraying out of the Soyuz spacecraft which is docked to the ISS. Roscosmos said on December 22 that it was considering a rescue mission to ferry the crew members back to Earth earlier than expected Reuters reported. This would involve flying an empty spacecraft to the ISS to pick them up per the report. This man used AI to write and illustrate a childrens book in one weekend. He wasnt prepared for the backlash.
