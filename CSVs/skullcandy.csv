1,JLab has a bunch of exciting true-wireless earbuds and more lined up for 2023,We’ll meet JLab’s new tiny TWS and its first high-end model at CES,https://www.androidpolice.com/jlab-true-wireless-2023-launches-hearing-aids-jbuds-mini/,Truewireless earbuds have evolved into countless subcategories now with options ranging from the excellent Sony WF1000XM4 to budget picks with tiny cases like the Skullcandy Dime. With CES just a few days away popular valuefocused audio brand JLab is showing off its latest pair of pocketfriendly truewireless earbuds and its first flagship offering both headed for store shelves in 2023. The 40 JBuds Mini are the companys smallest earbuds ever 30 smaller than the JLab Go Air Pop via Digitaltrends. Instead of sporting lanyard holes like the AirPods Pro 2 the JBuds Mini charging case sports an integrated loop so you attach it to something larger like your keys just to avoid losing it. The tiny case lends the earbuds 20 hours of playback time. Although these buds are small they dont sacrifice functionality with support for full touch controls still included. The 40 JBuds Mini JLab has always been a budget brand but next year it is diversifying into the flagship segment. The 200 Epic Air Lab Edition earbuds are designed to compete with other highend offerings sporting a hybrid dualdriver design active noise cancelation ANC and touch controls like the smaller JBuds Mini. JLabs understandably touts this new truewireless option as its bestsounding product to date. Theyre also backed by admirable battery life if its claims of 54 hours of playback time are anything to go by. The 200 Epic Air Lab Edition To differentiate its product from hordes of other 200 buds on the market JLabs includes a USBC dongle in the charging case of the Epic Air Lab Edition. You can plug this dongle into your phone tablet or computer to enjoy lower latency wireless audio over Bluetooth LE. If you dont want to risk losing the dongle standard multipoint Bluetooth connectivity is also supported. Renders of JLabs upcoming hearing aids JLab also plans to make FDAapproved medical devices including the 99 OTC Hearing Aid and the SelfFitting OTC Hearing Aid for which pricing isnt clear yet. The hearing aids will debut later this year while the TWS buds will be on display at CES 2023. They will go on sale during the third quarter of 2023.,2022-12-30T22:37:58Z
2,"JLab’s new earbuds are smaller than a dime, and it says $99 hearing aids are on the way","JLab will be introducing several new products at CES 2023, including its smallest set of wireless earbuds, and OTC hearing aids that it plans to sell for $99.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/jlab-jbuds-mini-epic-lab-edition-earbuds-ces-2023/,Ahead of next weeks CES 2023 show in Las Vegas JLab is giving us a sneak peek at what it will be showing to attendees. The company which has a reputation for very affordable audio gear is showing off its JBuds Mini a 40 set of wireless earbuds that are tiny 30 smaller than the JLab Go Air Pop which were already remarkably small. They come in a charging case thats designed to attach to a key ring much like the Skullcandy Dime and the entire package is no bigger than most wireless car keyfobs. Previous JLab earbuds have come with charging cases that have integrated USB cables but the JBuds Mini take a more conventional approach with a separate USBC cable. The JBuds Mini are expected to hit stores in the fall of 2023 with six hours of playtime per charge in the earbuds and 24 hours when you include the charging case. Theyre also compatible with Bluetooth Multipoint for simultaneous connections to two devices. JLab also has something new for those who want a more premium wireless experience. Also arriving in the fall the 199 JLab Epic Lab Edition earbuds use a hybrid driver design that combines a 10mm dynamic driver and a Knowles balanced armature B. A. driver. JLab says this produces the most detailed balanced and clear sound the company has ever achieved from a set of earbuds. They also support JLabs customizable active noise cancellation ANC and transparency modes plus wireless charging. The most unusual aspect of these new buds is the included USBC dongle that stows away inside the case. This gives devices like phones and computers the ability to connect to the Epic Lab Edition using Bluetooth LE Audio. LE Audio offers a new codec called LC3 which is more efficient than the previous Bluetooth standard SBC but JLab is most interested in LC3s low latency capabilities which make it a very good choice for gamers. Theres no word yet on battery life Bluetooth Multipoint or whether the Epic Lab Edition will support additional Bluetooth codecs like AAC LDAC or Qualcomms aptX family of codecs. Finally JLab is taking a stab at the newly opened market for OTC hearing aids. Though the details remain thin the company says it intends to sell two types of these devices an OTC Hearing Aid 99 and a SelfFitting OTC Hearing Aid price still TBD. JLab hasnt said how these two devices will differ but claims they will both offer a discreet design iOS and Android streaming compatibility impressive battery life and a twoyear warranty. Considering that typical hearing aids cost in the thousands and that even new OTC hearing aids from companies like Sony cost as much as 1000 a set of devices that cost only 100 would be a remarkable achievement if theyre effective. JLab hasnt indicated when its hearing products will be available.
