For many of us our accounts are filled with years of photos memories and memes that arent easy to part with even if we are ready to stop the daily scrolling habit. For Facebook Instagram and other Metarun services deleting an account entirely isnt necessarily straightforward either. And even though all the services are run by the same company there isnt one centralized way to delete all your Metaassociated accounts. The good news is that removing these accounts is in many cases a lot easier than it has been in the past even if there are sometimes a few extra steps involved. Keep reading to find out exactly how to delete your Facebook Instagram Messenger WhatsApp and Oculus accounts. First download your data Regardless of your reasons for wanting to leave your accounts behind its worth it to take the time to download all your data before you delete them for good. Downloading your data will ensure you have a record of your prior posts messages photos and other activity. These data archives look a little different for each service but in general they contain your previous posts a record of what accounts you follow your messages and even some of your past activity on the services. Some like Facebook will even provide a record of what the sites advertisers know about you. In other words its a lot of data. And it may not seem like a lot of that is worth hanging onto but if youve used an account for years its a good way to preserve a record of your past photos videos and other posts. Though you should also be prepared for it to surface some data you might not want to remember like conversations with former partners or cringey college photos. On Facebook you can access your archive from Settings Privacy Settings Your Facebook Information download your information request download. On Instagram its More Settings Privacy and Security Data download Request download. On WhatsApp its Settings Account Request account info. Of note WhatsApps reports dont include the content of your actual messages. If you want to preserve a copy of your messages youll need to export your chat history on each message thread you wish to hang onto. On Messenger downloads have to be initiated through the mobile app. On both Android and iOS go to Account Settings located in the chats tab Your Facebook Information Download your information. Youll then be able to specify a few aspects of the data like the media quality data format and date range you want the download to cover. For Oculus and Meta Quest users you can use the download your information tool linked here. Once you have your data archives stashed away youll be ready to permanently nuke your accounts. Though like the data downloads it can take up to several days for the process to be complete.

In some cases you might be able to recover them via the apps support channels but theres no guarantee. Follow the steps here to review which apps and websites you use Facebook as a log in. Likewise if your Oculus account is linked to your Facebook identity then deleting your Facebook will also permanently delete your Oculus account including your past purchases. Of note Meta now allows VR users to create a separate Meta account that doesnt rely on Facebook.

Of note this process will only work until January 1 2023 when Meta will force all Oculus accounts to migrate to the new Meta accounts mentioned above. For those newer Meta accounts you can delete your presence by heading to auth. meta. comsettings logging in selecting delete your account entering your password again and choosing delete your data. Again keep in mind this will prevent you from using your VR headset and will remove any past purchases youve made.,2022-12-22T14:15:17Z
1,Ireland fines Meta over $400 million for its targeted advertising practices,Ireland’s Data Protection Commission has issued two fines for how Meta handled Facebook and Instagram compliance with Europe’s GDPR.,https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23538750/ireland-dpc-meta-instagram-facebook-gdpr-violation-fines,Irelands Data Protection Commission DPC has fined Meta over its handling of user data following hundreds of millions of dollars in similar fines and potentially putting parts of its ad business at risk. The DPC announced today that Meta must pay 210 million around 222 million for violating European Union privacy rules with Facebooks practices plus 180 million around 191 million over similar violations with Instagram. The fines stem from two 2018 complaints about how Meta formerly Facebook complied with the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which went into effect that year. Both Facebook and Instagrams terms of service began requiring users to accept a new terms of service contract that included the processing of user data. But the complaints alleged that this amounted to forcing them to consent to things like targeted advertising in violation of the new rules. The DPC found that Metas updates had been insufficiently clear and after consulting with the European Data Protection Board EDPB it decided that Meta couldnt rely on the contract as an absolute defense of its business practices. The EDPBs guidance also led regulators to increase their planned fines for the company. In addition to the fines Meta must bring its operations into compliance with the GDPR within three months. Previous reporting by The Wall Street Journal indicated that Meta could face significant restrictions on its ability to conduct targeted advertising under the new rules. In a blog post Meta said it intended to appeal the decisions but it denied that they meant it would have to stop the practice. These decisions do not prevent personalized advertising on our platform. The decisions relate only to which legal basis Meta uses when offering certain advertising it said. We are assessing a variety of options that will allow us to continue offering a fully personalized service to our users. These fines come on top of several previous rulings that Meta violated European regulations. The DPC determined in November that Meta should pay 276 million over a 2021 data leak in September it issued a 402 million fine for how it handled teens Instagram data and in March it fined the company around 18 million for recordkeeping problems.,2023-01-04T15:24:10Z
2,"Seattle Schools Sue TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube Over Students' Mental Health","Seattle’s public school district is suing Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, and their parent companies.

The lawsuit filed on Friday in a U. S. District Court alleges that these social media sites have been a primary factor in a youth mental health crisis and that these platforms have knowingly exploited manipulated and targeted young people for profit at the expense of their mental heath. The district argues in its 91page complaint that tech giants have intentionally engineered addicting platforms cashed in on the vulnerability of stilldeveloping brains and algorithmically suggested harmful content to young users. Ultimately the school district is blaming these social media companies for the increase in mental health and behavioral issues that teens are showing up to classrooms with which has rendered the task of educating more difficult according to the suit. District officials point to a 30 increase in selfreported feelings of sadness and hopelessness among the student body as well as a rise in student suicide plans and attempts between 2010 and 2018. In an effort to manage those challenges the school district says it has had to take expensive actions like hiring more mental health counselors creating curriculum surrounding social media and mental health adjusting and enforcing school policies surrounding social media use and increasing disciplinary resources. However even all of these changes havent been enough to manage. Plaintiff cannot keep up with the increased need for mental health services because of the youth mental health crisis the lawsuit claims. So the Seattle schools are seeking accountability for social media platforms and meaningful change in how these companies operate along with damages and compensation. In past similar cases tech companies have used Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as a legal shield. Under the law digital publishers are not responsible for thirdparty content posted on their platforms i. e. Meta is not liable for anything its users post on Instagram and Facebook. However the Seattle case aims to get around this fundamental protection by targeting the design of social media sitesnot their content. The school district is claiming the increasing incentives to spend more and more time scrolling and the algorithms that dictate what users see causes harm toonot just whats in the posts. Defendants have maximized the time usersparticularly youthspend on their platforms by purposely designing refining and operating them to exploit the neurophysiology of the brains reward systems to keep users coming back coming back frequently and staying on the respective platforms for as long as possible says the complaint. Some psychology research along with both internal and external reports on social media company practices seem to support many of the new lawsuits claims. Studies have shown for instance that social media use and increased smartphone use may be linked to sleep depravation and accompanying depression. A Pew 2022 analysis found that more than half of teenagers surveyed would have a hard or very hard time giving up social media. Metas own internal research suggested that Instagram is toxic to some teen users particularly girls as it cultivates and amplifies body image issues. And Facebook has known for years that its algorithms boost time spent on its site to users detriment. However its very difficult to establish a direct link between increased social media use and worsened mental health because there are so many variables involved in mental health. And many experts dispute the use of the term addiction as applied to social media platforms altogether. This isnt the first attempt to sue social media companies for alleged mental health or youth harms in the U. S.. However past suits have mostly focused on individual cases. For instance the mother of a 10year old who died in 2021 sued ByteDance over allegations that a TikTok challenge caused her childs death. And in April the mother of a Wisconsin 17year old who died by suicide sued Meta and Snapchat for knowingly and purposely creating harmful and addicting products. The FTC has forced Fortnite to change its interface design so as to be less deceptive and fined Epic Games half a billion dollars. California legislators even tried to pass a bill banning addictive social media and explicitly making tech companies liable for every resulting violation involving children. The bill failed but more than 30 states currently have some sort of proposed or pending legislation aimed at regulating social media. Gizmodo reached out to Meta Instagram and Facebooks parent company Alphabet Google and Youtubes parent company TikTok owned by ByteDance Inc. and Snapchat owned by Snap Inc. for comment. We want teens to be safe online wrote Metas head of global safety Antigone Davis in a response statement emailed to Gizmodo. Davis statement cited tools the company has developed to support teen and families like age verifications parental controls and notifications encouraging breaks. Further it read we dont allow content that promotes suicide selfharm or eating disorders and of the content we remove or take action on we identify over 99 of it before its reported to us. Though past cases like the death of 14year old Molly Russell in the U. K. have demonstrated that harmful content like selfharm promotion does slip through the cracks. In the lead up to her suicide Russell interacted with more than 2000 Instagram posts relating to selfharm suicide and depression. A Google spokesperson too responded by highlighting the efforts he said the company has taken to make its platforms safer for children and teenslike screen time reminders and content blocks. TikTok and Snapchat did not immediately respond.,2023-01-09T17:17:00Z
3,Facebook parent Meta to settle Cambridge Analytica scandal case ... - Reuters,"Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/companies/META.O"" target=""_blank"">(META.O)</a> has agreed to pay $725 million to resolve a class-action lawsuit accusing the social media giant of allowing third parties, including Cambridge A…",https://www.reuters.com/legal/facebook-parent-meta-pay-725-mln-settle-lawsuit-relating-cambridge-analytica-2022-12-23/,Facebook parent Meta to settle Cambridge Analytica scandal case for 725 million Companies Dec 23 Reuters Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc META. O has agreed to pay 725 million to resolve a classaction lawsuit accusing the social media giant of allowing third parties including Cambridge Analytica to access users personal information. The proposed settlement which was disclosed in a court filing late on Thursday would resolve a longrunning lawsuit prompted by revelations in 2018 that Facebook had allowed the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to access data of as many as 87 million users. Lawyers for the plaintiffs called the proposed settlement the largest to ever be achieved in a U. S. data privacy class action and the most that Meta has ever paid to resolve a class action lawsuit. This historic settlement will provide meaningful relief to the class in this complex and novel privacy case the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs Derek Loeser and Lesley Weaver said in a joint statement. Meta did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement which is subject to the approval of a federal judge in San Francisco. The company said in a statement settling was in the best interest of our community and shareholders. Over the last three years we revamped our approach to privacy and implemented a comprehensive privacy program Meta said. Cambridge Analytica now defunct worked for Donald Trumps successful presidential campaign in 2016 and gained access to the personal information from millions of Facebook accounts for the purposes of voter profiling and targeting. Cambridge Analytica obtained that information without users consent from a researcher who had been allowed by Facebook to deploy an app on its social media network that harvested data from millions of its users. The ensuing Cambridge Analytica scandal fueled government investigations into its privacy practices lawsuits and a highprofile U. S. congressional hearing where Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was grilled by lawmakers. In 2019 Facebook agreed to pay 5 billion to resolve a Federal Trade Commission probe into its privacy practices and 100 million to settle U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission claims that it misled investors about the misuse of users data. Investigations by state attorneys general are ongoing and the company is fighting a lawsuit by the attorney general for Washington D. C. Thursdays settlement resolved claims by Facebook users that the company violated various federal and state laws by letting app developers and business partners harvest their personal data without their consent on a widespread basis. The users lawyers alleged that Facebook misled them into thinking they could keep control over personal data when in fact it let thousands of preferred outsiders gain access. Facebook argued its users have no legitimate privacy interest in information they shared with friends on social media. But U. S. District Judge Vince Chhabria called that view so wrong and in 2019 largely allowed the case to move forward. The settlement covers an estimated 250 to 280 million Facebook users according to Thursdays court filing. How much an individual user receives will depend on how many people submit valid claims for a share of the settlement. Lawyers for the plaintiffs say they plan to ask the judge to award them up to 25 of the settlement as attorneys fees equaling about 181 million.

Elon Musk put his own leadership of Twitter on the line at the weekend. Should I step down as head of Twitter I will abide by the results of this poll he tweeted. The poll ended and 57. 5 percent of users voted Yes compared to 42. 5 percent who voted no with 17502391 votes a decisive 15point margin. It remains to be seen if and how and when Musk will abide by his poll as he has yet to issue any comment about the results. Shortly after publishing the vote and when it was already tilting toward Yes he tweeted as the saying goes be careful what you wish as you might get it. The vote follows a flurry of activity on Twitter after it announced a sudden rule change prohibiting users from linking to competing platforms and banning several influential users soon after. A massive backlash ensued prompting an apology from Musk who also tweeted that going forward there will be a vote for major policy changes. Then in yet another poll yesterday TwitterSafety asked users whether it should have a policy preventing the creation of or use of existing accounts for the main purpose of advertising other social media platforms.

Instagram lets you create your own 2022 Recap Reel Select at least three photos or videos and the app will automatically combine them into a Reel. Instagram has been placing a bigger focus on Reels this year and that extends to how users create their 2022 Recap whether you want it to or not. Select at least three photos or videos and Instagram will automatically stitch these together into a Reel with narration templates from the likes of Bad Bunny Priah Ferguson and DJ Khaled. Hopefully those can be toggled off too. Reels have been a major focus for Meta over the past year. Across Instagram and Facebook the company now says Reels are played over 140 billion times every day. Meta has been bolstering its answer to TikTok by making it easier to create Reels launching an inapp Reels scheduler and ways to post to Reels from thirdparty apps. European Commission tells Meta that Facebook Marketplace is unfair to rivals It abused its dominant position. Europe has hit Facebook owner Meta with a complaint that its Marketplace classified service is unfair to competitors. By tying its main social media site to Marketplace it has a substantial distribution advantage over rivals the EU Commission wrote in a press release. With its Facebook social network Meta reaches globally billions of monthly users and millions of active advertisers EU Antitrust Commissioner said in a statement. Our preliminary concern is that Meta ties its dominant social network Facebook to its online classified ad services called Facebook Marketplace. This means that users of Facebook automatically have access to Facebook Marketplace whether they want it or not. This all infringes on EU rules that prohibit the abuse of a dominant market position. The EU has the power to impose a fine of up to 10 percent of Metas annual revenue and prohibit the behavior. Metas head of EMEA competition said the claims made by the European Commission are without foundation.

From February advertisers will no longer be able see a users gender or the type of posts they have engaged with as a way of targeting adverts to them. Under the enhanced restrictions only a users age and location will be used to show them advertising Meta said. The social media firm also confirmed that new controls would be introduced in March enabling teenagers to go into the settings in both apps and choose to see less of certain types of adverts. Many online safety campaigners say social media platforms need to do more to control the types of advertising shown to younger users saying inappropriate ads can cause as much harm as offensive or abusive content posted by others. Meta has previously added restrictions that stop advertisers from targeting teenagers with adverts based on their interests and activities and the company said the latest updates came in response to research on the issue direct feedback from experts and global regulation. As part of our continued work to keep our apps ageappropriate for teens were making further changes to their ad experiences Meta said in a blogpost. We recognise that teens arent necessarily as equipped as adults to make decisions about how their online data is used for advertising particularly when it comes to showing them products available to purchase. For that reason were further restricting the options advertisers have to reach teens as well as the information we use to show ads to teens. This isnt the first time Meta has been forced to look at its impact on its teenage users. Irish regulators launched a twoyear investigation into whether Instagram exposed the contact information of its underage users by allowing them to publicly post their phone numbers and email addresses when they switched to a business account in 2020. In September 2022 Meta was fined 405m 492m for violating the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen also first revealed to the Wall Street Journal in September 2021 that the company knew and had conducted research that showed that its photosharing app Instagram had a harmful impact on the mental health of teen girls. In a blog post responding to the article Instagram head of public policy Karina Newton said that the company takes the findings seriously but contended social media wasnt inherently good or bad for people. Many find it helpful one day and problematic the next. What seems to matter most is how people use social media and their state of mind when they use it.,2023-01-10T14:00:12Z

For a long time there has been no place where this is more true than on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Controversy and conflict keep you clicking commenting and generating the data about yourself that is used to sell ads. Every day it becomes more obvious that the intertwined model of conflict privacy violations and ad revenue is unsustainable for the companies that own and operate these networks. Its a lesson that Twitter should be learning as it finds itself deeply exposed and at risk of collapse. While Elon Musks flirtation with a subscriptionbased revenue model is part of the solution hes missing the point. Technology and social media companies that have a subscription model create products and services for the benefit of the subscriber. Its not surprising that privacy is one of the benefits that most people expect. Those privacy concerns have pushed Apple and policymakers to restrict how social media companies track and use users data. While Meta Twitter and Snap have cut thousands of jobs and Meta has lost twothirds of its value platforms that dont rely on user data to sell ads can protect user privacy without threatening their core businesses. When platforms embrace a subscription model they are no longer incentivized to function as purveyors of conflict and merchants of controversy. It is no coincidence that for the past few years the common social media experience is doomscrolling while our blood pressure steadily rises. Many of us remember a time when we went online to explore our interests with a community of likeminded people. This is an experience that companies can offer when the interests of subscribers rather than those of advertisers are the focal point of product design. So if subscriptionbased revenue models offer a path forward for social media companies why is Elon Musk flailing and failing so publicly as Twitter dabbles in a mix of ads and subscriptions Its hard to put your subscribers first when you dont respect their privacy and continue to serve the same noisy conflict theyve grown weary of. It also turns out that advertisers and users have limited tolerance for a platform and a CEO so desperately attempting to be the center of controversy and attention. The social media landscape is facing the most significant disruptions weve seen in its almost 20year history. We are going to see radical changes in the business models of big social media companies in 2023. As social media companies face increasing challenges with the ad revenue business model we expect to see more companies making decisions that keep users happy including valuedriven subscription models decentralization and more robust privacy policies. Otherwise they will continue to see the pain they saw in 2022. Jeffrey Scott Edell is the CEO of the social network MeWe and the former chairman of MySpace.,2023-01-08T14:00:00Z

O is preparing to announce whether it will allow former U. S. President Donald Trump back on to Facebook and Instagram the Financial Times reported on Sunday. The social media giant had previously said it will decide by Jan 7 whether to allow the former president to return. However that decision is now expected to be announced later in the month the newspaper said citing a person familiar with the matter. Meta has set up a working group to focus on the matter according to people with knowledge of its operations the report said adding that the group includes staffers from the public policy and communications teams as well as from the content policy team. Meta did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment. The development comes after Elon Musk Twitters new owner revoked a permanent ban on Trump in November last year on the social media platform after polling users. Trump maintained that he had no interest in returning to Twitter. I dont see any reason for it the former president had said via video when asked whether he planned to return to Twitter by a panel at the Republican Jewish Coalitions annual leadership meeting. Trump has mounted relentless attacks on the integrity of U. S. voting since his 2020 election defeat and launched a bid in November to regain the presidency in 2024 aiming to preempt potential Republican rivals.
