Its hard to imagine a world without his iconic comic book characters including SpiderMan the XMen Iron Man the Fantastic Four Black Panther Daredevil Thor the Hulk AntMan and the Wasp. In honor of the legendary storyteller Disney released a teaser for its documentary on Lee to commemorate 100 years of the awesomeness of his mighty creations and contributions to pop culture as we know it. That signature laugh rings out true and heartbreakingly bitterswet amid the montage of Marvel Studios cameos. Gosh we miss that mans presence. Lee was known later in life as a lucky charm appearance in each Marvel movie and later on in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I still tear up at his cameo in Into the SpiderVerse which perfectly sends him off as he passes the baton to the next generation of storytellers.

Metaphorically speaking. Seriously the trailer is all about Jonathan Majors Kang and how Paul Rudds Scott gets quantumly entangled with the villain. Theres a ton going onincluding the first look at MODOKbut just watch it It wouldnt be an AntMan movie if Scott didnt make some kind of mistake and in Quantumania hes clearly going to help Kang in return for getting back the five years he lost with his daughter Cassie Kathryn Newton during the Blip. Its an understandable motivation but given Kangs name is in the title of that upcoming new Avengers movie its pretty clear he doesnt have the best intentionslike conquest of all spacetimetype intentions and this trailer reveals Kang definitely has the power resources and forces to do just that. Plus MODOK While Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe may have been more about introductions and place setting this official kickoff to Phase 5 is ready to bring the unimaginable scope of the quantum realm and the multiverse together in ways the heroes of the MCU arent ready for but that audiences are obviously clamoring for. AntMan and the Wasp Quantumania will also bring back Evangeline Lilly as Hope Van Dyne Michael Douglas as Hank Pym and Michelle Pfieffer as Janet Van Dyne. Directed by Peyton Reed who helmed the first two AntMan films the movie premieres on February 17.

A Spy Among Friends ITVX This excellent dramatisation of the story of Kim Philby stars Guy Pearce as the traitorous spy.

Damian Lewis and Anna Maxwell Martin also bring a blend of heartbreak and classy restraint. Andor DisneyThis Rogue One prequel joined a few more dots in the Star Wars universe and revealed its dark underbelly.

He has a tenuous grasp on intersectional theory but reckons he knows what women want. Might he help her become the porn queen of Pasadena A moreish comedy thats a total joy. Ms Marvel Disney The MCUs first Muslim superhero Kamala Khan the brilliant Iman Vellani in her first ever acting role is a hugely relatable PakistaniAmerican teen who adores the Avengers and whose other preoccupations fitting in her interfering parents are entirely universal.

But for all of the grand often traumatic events it documents it never fails to explore the personal emotional dimension of history how changing times change people.

A funny and tender friendship develops Danny is lairy but never mean while the recent loss of Jacks father lends an undertow of melancholy. Detectorists BBC iPlayer Why not celebrate the festive return of Mackenzie Crook and Toby Joness charming golddiggers Andy and Lance by rummaging through the three seasons during which Detectorists became one of the BBCs most cherished recent offerings A funny and profound musing on history continuity and friendship. Dont Hug Me Im Scared All 4 A beautifully oddball creation this comedy initially has top notes of Sesame Street and Rainbow before sprawling macabre details of a much darker hue become inescapable. Delightfully demented and despite appearances definitely not one to share with the kids. How to With John Wilson BBC iPlayer A magnificent cross between an early Louis Therouxstyle innocent and a television intellectual such as Jonathan Meades documentarymaker Wilson serves up a unique and addictive series. The subject matter of each 20oddminute episode scaffolding in New York cooking risotto can sound humdrum. But Wilson follows every story to strange digressive glorious places. Ladhood BBC iPlayer Liam Williamss autobiographical comingofage comedy combines acute observations about class gender and mental health with hilarious weed and alcopop fuelled hijinks from his Leeds adolescence. How did the thoughtful stroppy teen become the smart but restless adult Mo Netflix A soulful immigrant story with jokes.

Instead its a celebration of functional multiculturalism with a humane subtly polemical heart. The Rehearsal Now Ive been told my personality can make people uncomfortable says Nathan Fielder. Hes not wrong this prankreality comedy is one of the most brainfrying shows in years. The premise is that Fielder helps participants rehearse for difficult moments in their lives but the rehearsals are so immersive that fact and fiction blur to disorienting effect. Youll laugh and youll freak out too. Stewart Lee SnowflakeTornado BBC iPlayer The comic embodiment of the metropolitan elite parades his masterful selfreflexive set from 201920. As ever its full of cultural provocations brilliantly calibrated callbacks uneasy audience interactions and hilarious disses of Alan Bennett. The place where standup and the avant garde meet. R ealityD ocumentary Drink Masters Netflix Since its Christmas might a boozy Bake Off hit the spot This entertaining series applies the eliminative competition show format to the world of mixology and it turns out barkeeps are capable of getting every bit as molecular as highend chefs in search of masterpieces of liquid art. Frozen Planet II BBC iPlayer David Attenboroughs journeys into natural wonder shouldnt be taken for granted this latest series throws up yet more painstakingly filmed beauty and strangeness from the coldest depths and peaks of the world. From the hilarious Pallass Cat to the aweinspiring Siberian tiger the planets fragile glory has never been better captured. Joe Pera Talks With You All 4 Part of the Adult Swim TV empire but tonally unlike anything else theyve produced this wonderfully gentle yet deceptively peculiar series sees Pera a gangling slightly awkward naif sharing bitesize snippets of wisdom on all manner of matters from the construction of a bean arch to obituary writing. Lizzos Watch Out for the Big Grrrls Prime Video Lizzo is looking for backup dancers for her world tour but shes after girls who look a bit like her. This cheerful reality show sees 13 women faceoff for the gig. Even though theres a competitive element the tone is entirely affirming curves and confidence are the order of the day and Lizzo herself is a relentlessly positive presence. Russia 19851999 TraumaZone BBC iPlayer A departure for Adam Curtis this latest series from the enigmatic magus of the BBC archives features no voiceover and no music. Instead the remarkable images carry the staggering and harrowing story. How did it feel to watch not one but two systems of government collapse in the space of two decades The ramifications could hardly be more pertinent. An intuitive emotional history darkly comic and utterly tragic. Storyville The Fire Within BBC iPlayer The pick of the many excellent Storyville documentaries currently on iPlayer is Werner Herzogs startling requiem for volcanochasers Katia and Maurice Krafft whose lifelong passion caught up with them when they died in 1991. The close eruption footage they captured makes the risks they took seem understandable. The Tinder Swindler Netflix One of the best of Netflixs glut of truecrime documentaries is this enraging tale about conman Simon Leviev who used the titular dating app to contact women seduce them with lavish gifts then relieve them of large sums of money.

However Scotts scientist ally Janet van Dyne Michelle Pfeiffer implies that Kang isnt to be trusted and the trailer suggests that he goes back on his word. Probably because hes a bad dude. Its likely building to Avengers The Kang Dynasty which is due in theaters in May 2025. We also catch a glimpse of classic villain MODOK glimpsed around 057 and 146 whose comic counterparts experiments caused his head to grow to an unusually large size. His name is an acronym for Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing. Its unclear if his origin or name will be the same in the MCU but he retains the extremely comicbook look. You might also remember him as the star of the Hulu animated series in which he was played by Patton Oswalt and as the main villain from the 2020 Avengers game. As shown in the previous trailer released in October the movie will unfold as the adventurous Cassie sends a signal into the quantum realm.

In ten short years Marvel went from possessing a roster of unknown characters to being the most recognizable superhero brand in entertainment. In their first few phases Marvel was able to turn obscure characters like Hawkeye The Guardians of the Galaxy and AntMan into beloved anchors of multimillion dollar films. As the Infinity Saga drew to a close Marvel thought about duplicating their ironclad formula for movies in television with a slew of original content designed for Disney plus. Although the idea seemed brilliant at the time Marvels efforts on Disney plus have only intensified the audiences feelings of fatigue related to the brand. Instead of feeling as if they needed to watch every entry to keep abreast of the overarching plot fans started to skip certain shows and as a result films. According to Comic Book Resources Marvel could delay some of their scheduled Disney plus shows as they continue to focus on quality over quantity. According to The Direct a Disney Japan blog post has revealed that the three shows still on schedule for a 2023 launch are Secret Invasion LokiSeason 2 and Ironheart. The post excludes several other Disney shows Marvel announced for a potential 2023 launch at San Diego ComicCon namely What If Season 2 which had announced an early 2023 premiere Echo which was originally aiming for summer 2023 before being pushed back to much later in the year XMen 97 which was aiming for the fall and Agatha Coven of Chaos which had an announced a release window of late 2023early 2024.

Researchers develop blood test that can reliably detect Alzheimers disease The test could replace lumbar punctures and brain scans. When doctors need to confirm an Alzheimers diagnosis alongside brain scans it can involve a lumbar puncture an invasive and painful procedure thats more commonly known as a spinal tap. The next best tool for diagnosing Alzheimers disease is a blood test. While some tests can detect abnormal tau protein counts as a possible indicator of Alzheimers disease theyre less effective at spotting the telltale signs of neurodegeneration. But this week in the journal Brain a multinational team of researchers from Sweden Italy the UK and US detailed a new antibodybased blood test that can detect brainderived tau proteins specific to Alzheimers disease. Following a study of 600 patients the team found their test could reliably distinguish the illness from other neurodegenerative diseases.,2022-12-29T12:15:48Z,Marvel may delay Disney-plus content,Generally Neutral,60,"unknown, obscure, fatigue, plot, delay, fall, Chaos",-,-,engadget

Entrepreneurcontributors are their own. Hallmark symbols of business building and entrepreneurship are constructed on a series of rules parameters and functions that rely on established experiences over time. What if I told you there is a world without limits built on a set of constructs not rules You would undoubtedly think a world with an endless horizon line might be less than calming. If youre a famed thought leader emphasis on thought like Deepak Chopra you cross the chasm without concern for what lies beneath your feet. The reallife Indiana Jones crossing a bridge on utter faith Chopra and his partner Poonacha Machaiah are welcoming all of us into our own homes through their conscious Web3 platform Seva. Love meaning service and love in action. Related 6 Ways to Push Your Limits and Accomplish Things You Never Thought Possible Lets take the horizon line back two decades before Machaiah became the CEO of the Chopra Foundation and before Chopra himself became an author of over 90 books translated into almost 50 languages. Chopra and Machaiah met through a common friend and famed filmmaker of Elizabeth and Elizabeth The Golden Age Shekhar Kapur. It was at this meeting that the technology background of Machaiah and Chopra converged. I met Deepak and quickly asked him about his vision. So many people pined to understand the vision of this icon. He responded by saying that he planned on reaching a billion people for a more peaceful just sustainable healthier and joyful world. My reply was sign me up shares Machaiah. Chopra wasnt pitching Machaiah in the classic sense of business building but he had ignited a path for the College of William and Mary grad that had been kindling under the surface for some time. That conversation started our journey into wellbeing together. I wake up every day and ask myself Poonacha what are you going to do to ensure a more peaceful just sustainable healthier and joyful world Machaiahs computer science and engineering background has proved complimentary to the globally renowned leader of the meditation revolution. He had been a part of the Motorola team that innovated cellphone technology so new adventures were a part of his DNA. Deepak focuses on our joint efforts through the lens of wellbeing and consciousness and I look at our work through technology and the ability it technology has to democratize access for people. Chopra and Machaiah believe that the world is at a nexus point in history and the world of Web3 or as they like to say the multiverse has the potential to change the course of personal and professional experiences. Seva. Love has bundled together an initial consumer offering that aims to reach people outside of the standard Web3 fare. A combination of apps and metaverse meditation experiences are punctuated by the Chopraverse opening the digital door to Chopras House of Enlightenment a Roblox offering under the Choprakids umbrella and a curated library of educational resources created by the Chopra Foundation. Related If You Have No Clue What Web3 Is Youre Not Alone. Heres a Breakdown of the Future of the Internet. The app gabl Give. Ask. Borrow. Love. is emblematic of leadership that understands business is about walking not running. The app integrates documented experiences of good deeds in the physical world through social technology seeding user behavior reflective of the Seva. Love world. Machaiah sees an opportunity to lean into the metaverse as a therapeutic. Chopra and his endlessly engaging partner Machaiah might be the best tandem to think beyond Web3 gaming conventions. They were at the forefront of online meditation offerings beating out Calm and Headspace. Having Oprah as a collaborator on the 21day meditation challenge with Chopra and the foundation didnt hurt either. Imagine integrating an experience that helps you to breathe to meditate. That is an experience that can lead to kindness. I believe the metaverse is going to be the place where digital therapeutics will come to play. And thats the reason why Deepak and I are so excited about Seva. Love. The story of Seva. Love is just evolving and Chopras roots might explain his excitement for this stage of the endeavor. My mother was one of the most interesting storytellers says Chopra. When my little brother and I were young she would entertain us with stories. But she would stop halfway through her story. She would leave a cliffhanger for each of us to finish the next morning. We had to share our own conclusions and include all aspects including the villain the good and bad guys. The unknown excites the global icon citing those initial storytelling sessions as trigger points for his imagination. Chopra and Machaiah appear to have written a script that includes a vivid set of imaginative experiences where we all get to play in the scene. A welcomed opportunity for personal and professional experiences to take center stage. Coming home from a long day at the office has been forever and creatively depicted by Hollywood authors as an activity of respite in the face of the trials and tribulations of the cold dark unforgiving world of the adult experience. The front door closes sealing off the subject from the unrelenting pressures of life. That physical door transforms through Chopras guidance and Machaiahs tech wherewithal into a portal void of locks and peepholes to reveal a world governed by selfcontrol a sense of belonging and without outside edicts. The neighborhood is open. Chopra and Machaiah have laid out the welcome mat. Now they believe the time has come to hand over the keys to a new generation of digital users ready to take off where life and ones place converge to create wonderfully new and immersive adventures. The keys are yours and Deepak Chopra and Poonacha Machaiah beam at being your hosts.

The ingredient that we had going for our Mummy he said speaking to the staying power of the 1999 film was fun. When asked if hed return Fraser said Im not opposed to it.

The imagery is backed by music lights and pyrotechnic effects that recreate the Marvel Cinematic Universe vibe. The shows soundtrack will be made of iconic scores reorchestrated at the Abbey Road Studios in London. A similar show happened when Avengers Campus opened in Paris in July. The Marvelthemed area includes the rides Avengers Assemble Flight Force a retheme of extremely 90s Rock n Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith and SpiderMan Web Adventure. The areas US counterpart in Disney California Adventure includes the rides Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout and Web Slingers A SpiderMan Adventure theres also Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind in Disney Worlds Epcot park.

It saved one of its best choices for last in Eves Fight Song which itself has a pretty slick anime video. Animated and directed by frequent Eve collaborator Marie Yasui known by their handle Mariyasu the video strikes a very different tone for Eves latest track than the ED sequence for Chainsaw Mans 12th episode Katana vs. Chainsaw. Where that was all about chill vibes as Denji Power and Aki relax after their victory against the Katana Devil the actual music video for Fight Song is part supernatural underground fight club part rescue story as a young man bloodily brawls his way through demonic goons and their bosses in order to protect a young girl. Said young girl seemingly can turn into a dragon which is just one of the many cool things about this gorgeous video. The action is crisp and wonderfully framed the world is immediately engrossing. But perhaps the most fun thing is that the video keeps going after the end of the song with a cute faux gag reel of the videos characters acting like they were actually shooting a music video. Its a fun way to make this little world were introduced to in just a handful of minutes feel a little more alive beyond the demonpunching fun times.

18,"China continued to reject Marvel movies in 2022, and the country's box office plummeted 36%",China lost its crown as the world's biggest box office in 2022 as it dealt with rising coronavirus cases and rejected some big Hollywood releases.,https://www.businessinsider.com/china-box-office-plummeted-as-it-rejected-more-marvel-movies-2023-1,China continued to reject Marvel movies in 2022 and the countrys box office plummeted 36 Chinas box office dropped 36 in 2022 compared to the previous year. The region dealt with pandemicrelated lockdowns. The China box office beat out North Americas as the biggest in the world in 2020 and 2021. But it lost the crown in 2022. Chinas box office dropped 36 to 4. 35 billion in 2022 according to Deadline which cited figures that Chinas Film Administration released to state media. The 2022 North American box office rose to an estimated 7. 5 billion according to Comscore a 64 increase from the previous year. Pandemicrelated restrictions hurt Chinas theatrical industry in 2022 as it saw a surge in cases. For instance in March when The Batman opened in China 40 of the regions theaters were on lockdown. Needless to say the movie flopped. But the countrys film officials also blocked a number of Hollywood releases that could have given a muchneeded boost to its box office particularly Marvel movies. No pandemicera Marvel Cinematic Universe movies have been granted releases in China. The last MCU film to open there was SpiderMan Far From Home in 2019 grossing 199 million. Earlier that year Avengers Endgame was even bigger grossing 632 million. But in 2022 films like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness Thor Love and Thunder and Black Panther Wakanda Forever were denied entry into China. The movies grossed a combined 2. 5 billion globally but that figure could have been much higher had they opened in the region. The movies were reportedly denied releases over political and cultural sensitivities. Love and Thunder and Wakanda Forever didnt get past Chinas film censors because of LGBTQ themes depicted in the movies. Multiverse of Madness faced criticism for a scene that featured a newspaper kiosk with the Epoch Times which opposes the Chinese government. To make matters worse for its box office China also didnt have a local smash hit last year like it did in 2021 with The Battle at Lake Changjin. That film was 2021s second highestgrossing movie globally behind SpiderMan No Way Home and the vast majority of its box office came from China. The same can be said of Hi Mom another Chinese production and 2021s thirdlargest movie. A sequel to The Battle at Lake Changjin titled Water Gate Bridge opened in early 2022 but earned less than its predecessor. Still 85 of Chinas 2022 ticket sales came from local productions. In its fiveyear film plan released in late 2021 the China Film Administration made it a goal for local films to account for at least 55 of the countrys box office in any given year. So China may continue to be more selective about the Hollywood films it grants release dates to even if it means sacrificing some of its box office.

That movie is going to stay the full three hours and you will love it. From last years directors on directors interview for Variety Cameron said I think what we can see is an expanded form of cinema. I want to do a movie thats six hours long and two and a half hours long at the same time. Same movie. You can stream it for six hours or you can go and have a more condensed roller coaster immersive version of that experience in a movie theater. Same movie. Just ones the novel and ones the movie. While this would certainly point to a willingness to make a sixhour Avatar film executive producer Jon Landau told Polygon that wouldnt be happening for Avatar 2 or 3 because they simply dont have enough content to create a cut that long. Regarding the quote Landau said that he thinks Jim is seizing on opportunities for other stories with two different cutsthe idea would be that you build a larger epic narrative that can last six hours and you pull a twoandahalfhour movie out of it. But Avatar 3 has already been shot and The Way of Water is already in theaters. Theres really not a lot more that Cameron can do about getting those sixhour cuts to fans. Laundau shut speculation down pretty firmly practically stating We dont have the amount of content to do that.

But included in one of the snippets is a shot of Grace grabbing food in costumeone that isnt the Batgirl of Burnsideinspired costume that was all we ever glimpsed in officiallyreleased material from the movie. Instead it appears to be what couldve been Barbaras final costume in the movie. It looks mostly like an armored style take on the classic Batgirl costume from the iconic 1966 Batman TV showblending the modern superheroic padded gear look with the bright purple and yellow of Barbaras most famous costume. It works as an upgrade to the Burnsidestyle look which itself featured a more muted version of a similar color palette and while obviously a casual BTS shot isnt going to fully reflect how the suit wouldve looked shot and lit for the final film it seems like for now Warner Bros is just not going to give us a chance to see that.

As its title implies its main character Joaquin Phoenix is certainly terrified by the world... but that world looks far more bizarre than threatening at least as this buckwild first trailer shows. Theres no official synopsis but when you watch it I think youll see why 1 Theres probably no explaining the film before you watch the entire thing and 2 Aster surely has no desire to try and explain anything about the film before people see Phoenix travel through a sprawling increasingly fantastical landscape for what seems like a decade or more. But while there are certainly disturbing elements like whatevers going on with Beaus mom from the beginning of the trailer and riots in the streets but once Beau steps out of reality things look relatively benign. Besides whos to say whatever the hell the sinister character played by Nathan Lane isnt as much as fantasy as the cartoonish wonderland Beau wanders through for seemingly years However given this is an Aster film I feel things are probably not as straightforward as they seem and yes I say that knowing things already dont look straightforward at all. Beau Is Afraid also stars Nathan Lane Amy Ryan Stephen McKinley Henderson Zoe ListerJones Armen Nahapetian Parker Posey and Patti LuPone which is a hell of a cast.

He was injured while plowing snow on his Reno Nevada property and was airlifted to a local hospital. Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve told the Reno GazetteJournal on Monday that the Avengers actor was trying to help a stranded motorist when his snowplow hit him. Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said during a press conference on Tuesday that his offices investigation found that Renners personal vehicle was driven by a family member when it became stuck in the snow near the actors home. Balaam said his snowplow began to roll after Renner got out of the machine to talk to his family member after successfully towing the vehicle. The county sheriff said that his office believes the snowplow ran over Renner after he attempted to get back into the drivers seat of the machine to stop it from rolling. He called the incident a tragic accident. Renner released his first public statement since the accident in an Instagram post on Tuesday writing Thank you all for your kind words. Im too messed up now to type. But I send love to you all.,2023-01-05T18:13:15Z,Beau Is Afraid Looks Like a Horror Flick for Joaquin Phoenix Only,Somewhat Negative,310,"Afraid, twist, bizarre, threatening, disturbing, cartoonish, Afraid","desire, hell, hell","Ari, Aster, Joaquin, Phoenix, Aster, Phoenix, Beaus, Beau, Nathan, Lane, Beau, Aster, Nathan, Lane, Amy, Ryan, Stephen, McKinley, Henderson, Zoe, ListerJones, Armen, Nahapetian, Parker, Posey, Patti, LuPone",huffpost
23,Three Music Legends Collaborated on One Nintendo Game. Sparks Flew,"Grant Kirkhope, Yoko Shimomura, and Gareth Coker describe the musical journey of scoring Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope.",https://www.wired.com/story/mario-rabbids-composers-kirkhope-shimomura-coker/,French impressionism chromatic harmonies and Marvel music arent words youd use to describe the music in a Mario game. But then again Mario Rabbids Sparks of Hope isnt your typical Mario game so this chaotic combination of musical phrases makes sense for a crossover game that merges Ubisofts Raving Rabbids franchise with Mario and the Mushroom Kingdom. Sparks of Hope released in October is the sequel to Mario Rabbids Kingdom Battle which was revealed to the world at E3 2017. Taking to the stage Marios creator Shigeru Miyamoto recalled his first meeting with the games creative director Davide Soliani and told a packed audience he had just one condition for Soliani to go ahead with the project. Whatever you do dont try and make a jump game or a Mario platformer. Try and make a Mario game thats never been made before. Its fair to say that Soliani nailed that brief. With its fusion of turnbased strategy and RPG mechanics the Mario Rabbids franchise has more in common with XCOM than Super Mario Bros. Add the quirky humor of the Rabbids into the mix and on paper Mario Rabbids is a franchise that shouldnt workbut it does. When someone says to you Mario Rabbids you think what a daft idea that is right Mario Rabbids series composer Grant Kirkhope tells WIRED. Its not until you play the games that you realize how much it really works. Kirkhope is best known for writing the music in some of the bestselling games on the Nintendo 64 such as BanjoKazooie Goldeneye and Donkey Kong 64. His score for Kingdom Battle retains all of the quirkiness youd associate with Kirkhopes music but breaks enough boundaries to give the franchise a distinct musical style. Its a style that the games audio director Romain Brillaud defines as friendlyepic. This friendlyepic thing theres a bit of Moonrise Kingdom meets BanjoKazooie meets Marvel Brillaud says.,2022-12-26T14:00:00Z,Jeremy Renner Shares First Video From ICU Since Snowplow Accident,Somewhat Positive,50,"suffering, blunt, trauma, stuck, tragic, messed",-,"Jeremy, Renner, Renner, Renner, Hillary, Schieve, Darin, Balaam, Renners, Balaam, Renner, Renner, Renner",wired
24,Terrence Howard Claims He Didn't Return To ‘Iron Man’ Sequel Because He Would Be Paid 1/8 Of Contract,Terrence Howard once left $1 million on the table to reprise his role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).,https://news.yahoo.com/terrence-howard-claims-didnt-return-172520178.html,Terrence Howard Claims He Didnt Return To Iron Man Sequel Because He Would Be Paid 18 Of Contract Terrence Howard once left 1 million on the table to reprise his role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe MCU. Howard Was The Highest Paid Actor In Iron Man Howard appeared in Marvels first Iron Man and portrayed Colonel James Rhodes a best friend of Tony Stark. At the time of the films release in 2008 Entertainment Weekly reported that Howard was the highestpaid actor in the film earning 4. 5 million. According to Business Insider Howard agreed to a threepicture deal with Marvel in which he says he was supposed to earn 8 million for the second film. Howard Explains Why His Salary Was Cut When it was time to return as Colonel James Rhodes Howard claims a portion of his expected compensation had been drastically cut short because it was given to Robert Downey Jr. the lead for Tony Stark Iron Man. Howard also claims he was responsible for helping Downey Jr. land the prized role. It turns out that the person that I helped become Iron Man when it was time to reup for the second one took the money that was supposed to go to me and pushed me out Howard said to Andy Cohen on Bravos Watch What Happens Live. He continued I called my friend that I helped get the first job and he didnt call me back for three months. Howard says he was offered 18 of his expected compensation for Iron Man 2 and claims Marvel told him the movie will be successful with or without him. The second time they came and they said We think the movie will be successful with or without you. So instead of the 8 million that we said we were gonna pay you were going to let you come back for a million dollars Howard explained to Sway Calloway during his morning show Sway in the Morning. He continued It was a threepicture deal so Im like Oh were good. I forgot I didnt know that it was not a mutually binding contract. It was only beneficial for them. They could bring me back or not. They can honor it or not. Howards Exit Ultimately Howard felt it was in his best interest to walk away from the sequel. Don Cheadle was then recast for the role and had two hours to agree to a sixpicture deal with Marvel.

25,"In a Painful Year, Romance Nerds Embraced Radical Pleasure",Sometimes the best fantasies are the ones that could actually come true.,https://www.wired.com/story/romance-book-nerds-heroes/,It is a truth universally acknowledged that a science fiction writer in possession of a convention panel must be in want of a question as to where all the genres optimism went. Many born during the inception of cyberpunk like me have no recollection of a time when science fiction was inherently optimistic. But there is another genre that does optimism by default and is often ignored because it has traditionally been written by and for women romance. As bell hooks wrote Male fantasy is seen as something that can create reality whereas female fantasy is regarded as pure escape. Romance is optimistic purely because it believes unwaveringly in the possibility of growth change happiness and pleasureoften in the face of poverty illness trauma hate or mainstream values. Mr. Darcy does wrong and owns up to it. Lucy Honeychurch realizes her desires are valid. Anne Shirley gets over herself. Without change you dont have a romance novel says bestselling author Sarah MacLean. Pride prejudice madding crowds or simply the wreckage of a first marriage washing up on the Cornish coast All of these can be overcome in hope of a better future with ones partner of choice. Choice gives the fantasy its power. In her brief history of the romance novel librarian Amanda Pagan notes that Jane Austen and Charlotte Bront introduced female characters who were ultimately rewarded with successful marriages for expressing their individuality or their own desires. At the time this was considered groundbreaking. Not much has changed. We read books so we wont cry is how one reader explained it to researcher Janice Radway in her 1984 book Reading the Romance Women Patriarchy and Popular Literature. In the four decades since Radways research has become required reading for cultural studies scholars paving the way for all manner of fandom studies. Without her there is no Henry Jenkins or Jane McGonigal and quite possibly no Marvel Studios. Radway had the audacity to assert that some women read romance novels not because there is something lacking in them as people but rather something lacking in their worlds at large. What these women are looking for in their search for the perfect romantic fantasy is a man who is capable of the same attentive observation and intuitive understanding that they believe women regularly accord to men Radway wrote. In addition without its happy ending the romance could not hold out the utopian promise that malefemale relations can be managed successfully. That utopian promise has expanded since 1984. The world of romance has changed much as the worlds of dating sex marriage and relationships have in the 21st century. Namebrand commercial publishers are now putting out books with cute covers and punny titles written by and aimed at queer trans poly neurodivergent and disabled people of all races and genders including gasp cis white men. These books feature subplots involving STEM scripted reality shows hockey cupcakes cowboys race carsthe genre has more niches than Meta has microtargets. As the mission statement at Happily Ever After Books reads The modern romance genre is more diverse and inclusive than it has ever been and we can only continue to improve on those things by claiming a space for romance readers to celebrate the stories they can find themselves in stories that bring them joy that find them peace that excite them that show them they deserve respect and consent and trust in their romantic andor sexual relationships.,2022-12-25T12:00:00Z,No Headline,Extremely Negative,220,"Stark, drastically, Stark",-,"Terrence, Howard, Terrence, Howard, Howard, Howard, James, Rhodes, Tony, Stark, Howard, Howard, Howard, James, Rhodes, Howard, Robert, Downey, Jr., Tony, Stark, Howard, Downey, Jr., Iron, Man, Howard, Andy, Cohen, Howard, Howard, Sway, Calloway, Howard, Don, Cheadle",wired

Vormir is where stuff goes to die including my sanity thanks to some brutal slowdown and quirky bugs. Marvel Snap recently unleashed the winterverse full of fun festive new card variants and new store bundles for those players who have been carefully hoarding their hardearned gold. This is good. Im having fun. I want to get the card with Sunspot kicking back in the Icelandic hot spring. But last night Vormir appeared a new location that destroys the first card played there for either side. This is bad. Im not loving it. In fact Vormir may as well have pissed in my eggnog. For those unfamiliar with Vormir its a distant planet where Thanos murdered Gamora to get the Soulstone from Red Skull in Avengers Infinity War. Channeling this energy in Marvel Snap the new location with a 40 percent appearance rate through Thursday requires a sacrifice. The first card played there on both sides will get destroyed. Oh if only it were that simple. Read More 20 Tips I Wish I Knew Before Playing Marvel Snap 2022s Best New Card Game Vertagear 800 Series Gaming Chair Ergonomic comfort Adjustable seat height neck support memory foam pillow adjustable back rest and tilt locking system and 4D armrests that move in 4 directions to fit you best. While this would be enough to qualify it as one of the most annoying Marvel Snap locations in my book the real rub with Vormirwhich is awfully close to the French word vomir meaning to vomitis that oftentimes the animations can take forever to play out and things dont always go as youd expect. Why every vormir animation is 20 seconds snarked one player on the Marvel Snap discord. They arent wrong. Kotaku residents gabaghoul Alyssa Mercante said she thought her phone was going to explode after trying to play Sabretooth who returns to the players hand with a new zero energy cost when destroyed there. Meanwhile Vormir locked up our social media editor Jeb Biggarts iPhone forcing him to close out the game entirely and restart. I even had Vormir appear twice in a single match. No thank you friends. And even when Marvel Snap isnt getting hung up on Vormirs animations and calculations its doing someweird stuff. Snap players are the Sir Isaac Newtons of their day and they freaking love to test every new location with Green Goblin and Hobgoblin. You might think that if youre the one playing the mischievous five energy fiend that it would not count towards the opposing players Vormir sacrifice requirement. But you would be wrong. Many a goblin have perished this way in the name of science. There are of course cool things you can do with Vormir. When its not getting bugged by phantom Iron Fists or tricking you into thinking it already procd because the words are no longer highlighted you can drop Electro. The card gives you plus one max energy but prevents you from playing more than one card per turn. Unless it dies. Say by sacrificing it at Vormir. Genius. Deadpool is also utterly OP and broken at the moment. Just dont expect Angel to fly out of your deck and take his place. That also seems to be bugged at the moment.

Even if you were more of a DC comics fan than a Marvel zombie Stan Lee was still an affable and welcoming presence in the comic community. When Lee started making appearances in Marvel comics movies with 2000s XMen his cameos were initially brief and only intended for eagleeyed comic fans. However as Marvel became the multimedia juggernaut it currently is Lees cameos became more elaborate and infinitely more hilarious.

Host Jerrod Carmichael reminded the stars who flocked back to this years 80th Globes about the scandal that temporarily drove the show off of television kicking off the telecast by introducing himself as the Black face of an embattled White organization. The Globes came back to NBC this year after the network dropped the 2022 telecast following a Los Angeles Times report exposing the lack of diversity within the organization that presents them the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. and alleged ethical lapses by its members. Ill tell you why Im here Im here cause Im Black Carmichael said in an opening monologue that drew uncomfortable laughter from the audience in the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The HFPA responded to the public criticism when the story broke in 2021 by enacting various reforms. Hollywood has cautiously reembraced the festivities hoping in part that Globes recognition will provide an advantage in whats perceived to be a wideopen Oscar race. As for helping to shape what will make the cut at the Academy Awards when those nominations are announced on January 24 two movies that have barely made a ripple at the box office outmuscled popular contenders like Avatar The Way of Water and Top Gun Maverick in the movie voting. Because of the proximity to the Oscars thats invariably the most closely watched aspect of the awards leading up to it. The Globes are unique in that they split their top film honors in two. The Fabelmans earned statues as both best drama and for Spielberg his third Globe as a director while Banshees of Inisherin won for best musical or comedy as well for writer Martin McDonagh and star Colin Farrell. Carmichael joked about just taking the money for hosting but closed by saying that he accepted the job in part to provide a celebration for the entertainment figures in the room whom he admired. Notably in terms of the controversy five of the opening seven awards to performers went to people of color. That included Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan for the scifi comedy Everything Everywhere All at Once and Angela Bassett for Black Panther Wakanda Forever the Marvel sequel. Both films were broadly popular as opposed to the more narrowly skewed arthouse fare that ruled most of the film categories. Honored for his comeback role after a long acting hiatus Quan expressed gratitude to Spielberg who cast him as a child in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Bassett spoke of the late Chadwick Boseman and how the movies were part of his legacy. Quinta Brunson and Tyler James Williams were also recognized for the best comedy winner the ABC sitcom Abbott Elementary the rare series on a broadcast network to make inroads in the awards arena. Among dramas Zendaya earned another accolade for HBOs gritty teen drama Euphoria. From a production standpoint the ceremony frequently felt chaotic hurrying through the final hour and still running about 20 minutes over its scheduled threehour window. Part of that had to do with the longwindedness at least by the rules of awardshow etiquette of the recipients who established early on that they would ignore efforts to play them off with musical cues and simply forge ahead with their speeches and thankyous. In Yeohs case the noted action star pointed out that she could beat up the piano player if necessary. Consisting of international journalists the HFPA has traditionally favored European talent a trend generally less evident this year. Farrell did win for Banshees and Cate Blanchett for her role as the imperious conductor in Tr. Austin Butler was honored for his portrayal of Elvis Presley in the biography Elvis. Netflix also scored a win over Disney in the animated movie category with Guillermo del Toros Pinocchio a stopmotion version of the story. In the TV categories the Globes voters spread the wealth with HBO taking home four including best series and limited series honors for House of the Dragon and The White Lotus. ABC claimed three thanks to Abbott and FX a pair with one each for Netflix Apple TV Hulu and Paramount Network. Carmichaels introductions included a joke about Tom Cruise returning his Golden Globes amid the controversy drawing a muted response when he made a veiled reference to the actors ties to Scientology. Eddie Murphy delivered a lowkey speech in receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award before closing with a joke about Will Smiths slap at the Oscars that was one of the several utterances during the night to require bleeping out expletives. Receiving the careerachievement award in television Glee and American Horror Story producer Ryan Muprhy spoke of his mission to bring LGBTQ characters to the screen seeking to take the invisible the unloved and make them the heroes I always longed to see but never did in pop culture. The event also featured a recorded message from Ukrainian president Vlodymyr Zelensky who made a similar appearance at the Grammy Awards in April.,2023-01-11T01:27:50Z,We're getting a Stan Lee documentary from Disney Plus,Extremely Positive,20,"fall, zombie, insular",-,"Stan, Lee, Stan, The, Man, Lee, Stan, Lee, Lee, Lees, Stan, The, Man, Lee, Stan, Lee, Jack, Kirby",cnn

However the film was not without its controversies. When it was revealed that Marvel would not recast the role of TChalla after Bosemans untimely death Black Panther fans were split. Although there was precedent in the comics for Shuri to become the new Black Panther the MCU had yet to establish the plot line fully. Fans began to speculate if it was possible for Marvel to believably kill TChalla offscreen while simultaneously establishing Shuri as Black Panther in one film. And even though it was rough Marvel still managed to stick the landing through a heartfelt narrative and a litany of powerhouse performances from the films cast. According to Comic Book Resources Marvel originally planned for TChalla and Shuri to share the Black Panther mantle similar to how they did in the comics. While speaking on the Empire Podcast Wright revealed Marvels original idea was for TChalla and Shuri to both serve as the Black Panther to defend their beloved Wakanda in the sequel playing on the brother and sister duos close bond. When asked how she felt about putting on the Black Panther suit for the first time the BritishGuyanese actor said Shuri was ready for the challenge. It was bittersweet Wright said. Shuri was always gonna do it. But it was gonna be done in a different way where her brother was gonna be alongside her really explore that like the comic books the ways that TChalla and Shuri would be Black Panther alongside each other and try to figure out how to defend their nation.,2023-01-03T17:35:00Z,"

30,"Every MCU movie, ranked","Polygon ranks every movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from Iron Man to Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.",https://www.polygon.com/23519049/best-marvel-movies-mcu-ranked-worst,Fourteen years on the most incredible achievement the Marvel Cinematic Universe has made is a surprisingly simple one Its become mundane. Thats not meant as an insult the vibe shift as the kids say that the MCU has brought about is one so complete it has completely changed how blockbuster movies are thought about and discussed for better or worse. Explainers and theorizing have become commonplace discussions that once simmered in enthusiast corners have boiled over into the mainstream and how every film contributes to the mega franchise gestalt is carefully tracked and puzzled over. Its blockbuster cinema but its also a participation sport. Now Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is over and 2023 brings with it the next exciting chapter in the Multiverse Saga. But before things start to heat up once again its a good time to look back at the absolutely bonkers success of the MCU and consider what we look for in a Marvel movie and what Marvel movies are best at giving us. We at Polygon put our heads together to rank all 30 films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe thus far theres enough TV to warrant a separate list. Our committee was made up of 13 Polygon staffers who each submitted their own personal ranking of the MCU movies theyve seen. Their bottom choice got one point their secondtolast pick got two points and that scoring process continued all the way up. This way people who had seen all 30 films had a greater impact on the vote as they had the most context. Here is every MCU film ranked from worst to best for now. As the Marvel Cinematic Universe is still growing expect us to revisit and update this list periodically. 30. Thor Love and Thunder The hero take After multiple Marvel movies that made no significant use of Natalie Portmans acting chops Thor Love and Thunder handed her Mjolnir and more importantly gave her some downright adorable dialogue. Also good Tessa Thompson fighting as Valkyrie while wearing a Phantom of the Opera Tshirt. The villain take Director and writer Taika Waititi reprises his bit part as Korg who becomes a talkative but not quite funny enough narrator of the films events. Then theres Christian Bales heartwrenching performance as Gorr which belongs in a different movie maybe one that doesnt have Korgs goofball fairytale narration. Last but not least this movie has two Thors in it and it only needs one Natalie Portman obviously. Maddy Myers 29. Thor The Dark World The hero take The movie that cemented Lokis woobification for all time and a cameo thats quite possibly the most fun Chris Evans has ever had in the MCU. The villain take Woof. Marvels gonna have to make a lot of duds before Dark World with its forgettable villain and even more forgettable plot wont wind up near the bottom of these kinds of rankings. Susana Polo 28. Iron Man 2 The hero take With the early pre Avengers success of the nascent MCU Iron Man 2 is where these movies start to have some fun and this movie is absolutely stuffed to the brim with spectacle that made Iron Man look like an indie film in comparison. Iron Man 2 really brings out the toys whiplash Suitcase armor War Machine An army of drones And its the first film to truly lean into the connected nature of the MCU. The villain take Boy howdy what a mess. Every idea is underserved the character work is shallow Tony Stark has basically regressed between films and the MCU worldbuilding is a little too involved. An early cautionary tale for what the MCU could become without a modicum of care. Joshua Rivera 27. Avengers Age of Ultron The hero take Its a Marvel movie about making Marvel movies. Writerdirector Joss Whedon returns to look upon his work of making the impossible crossover of The Avengers a reality and despairs via the homicidal robot Ultron. Theres a valiant effort to will this big sequel into a quieter more dramatic film that almost succeeds. The villain take Bombast wins out and Whedons fun edge from the previous film is buffed away leaving something a little more sour behind. The machines have the best material here as Ultron and Vision are able to shoulder the metafictional and existential themes of the film while the Avengers proper are fumbling through some of their worst arcs. The less said about Hulk and Black Widow the better. JR 26. Eternals The hero take For all its flaws and there are many Eternals is one of the few Marvel movies that actually dives into the relationships between its heroes. This is the movie for everyone who ever wanted the Avengers to be a found family and not just a group of heroes who happen to work together. Its a poignant and moving story about the pains of immortality and the beauty of humanity. It also features one of the most diverse casts in the entire MCU as well as one of the most femalefronted teams The villain take It pokes way more holes into the Marvel Cinematic Universe than is worth the twohourand37minute run time. It asks the audience to care a lot about characters and dynamics they barely know and in order for that to happen the movie jampacks all the backstory into some clunky transitions. It shouldve been a show in my opinion Theres also been four subsequent movies and four subsequent television shows and not a single mention of the GIANT CELESTIAL POKING OUT OF THE EARTH OK there was a blinkandyoullmissit moment in SheHulk but still. It barely feels like its part of the MCU which is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on what youre here for. Petrana Radulovic 25. The Incredible Hulk The hero take The Hulks only MCU solo outing is a lean thriller that blends the jolly green giant with a bit of The Fugitive as Bruce Banner treks across the globe to stay ahead of a U. S. military that wants him in custody. A paranoid twitchy film that really gains a lot from star Ed Nortons performance still memorable despite successor Mark Ruffalos wellreceived arc across the various teamup films that followed. The villain take Every character that isnt Banner doesnt really have much to work with here and when the film does go into superhero mode the moody color palette means its a struggle to actually see whats happening. JR 24. Avengers Infinity War The hero take Its more or less the Empire Strikes Back of the MCU a dark heavy setup movie where the heroes suffer tremendous defeats and losses in order to make their triumphs in the next movie stronger. Along the way fans get to see characters interact who have never met before highlighting all of them in new and exciting ways. And then theres that ending still possibly the most breathless piece of pure horror in the entire franchise. The villain take Its too busy with so many characters that virtually none of the fan favorites get significant screen time and too many repetitive fights over Infinity Stones where the outcomes are foreordained. Various characters have to make disappointingly stupid choices to keep the plot rolling. Also Loki gets punked Hulk gets punked and Thor acts like he hasnt seen Loki die like eight times already. Tasha Robinson 23. Thor The hero take Technically more of a fishoutofwater comedy than a superhero movie Hemsworths goofiness plays great with Natalie Portman as the straight man and Stellan Skarsgrd is in this and he rules. The villain take The action is pretty bad its not particularly interesting and its biggest failing as a comedy is that its really only intermittently funny. Austen Goslin 22. SpiderMan No Way Home The hero take The end of the first trilogy featuring Tom Hollands SpiderMan goes out with an absolute bang bringing the villains and SpiderMans from the two previous liveaction iterations into one tangled web. With this escalated threat there are escalated stakes giving us the first film where the newest Peter Parker must struggle against an evil that wishes to hurt him personally and make him face the darkness that lies within himself. The villain take No Way Home can be read as an outrageously cynical film a movie thats essentially getting by on stolen valor borrowing the menace and character work done outside of the MCU to raise the stock of its own take on Peter ParkerSpiderMan. Its also yet another film that refuses to just let Peter face a threat on his own without an Avenger babysitting him. JR 21. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 The hero take Once writerdirector James Gunn established his merry band of Aholes as a bona fide MCU success he used his second goround as a chance to get weird. Vol. 2 is one of the few MCU projects to feel acutely personal both thematically and aesthetically as Gunns grossout schlock roots collide with a heartfelt and mildly vulgar story about fathers and sons family lost and found and pushing through the pain and anger that comes with feeling like you deserved more than you got. The villain take Guardians Vol. 2 overindulges in comic book group therapy. In some ways this is a remarkable thing about it. In others it shortchanges the characters and the actors that play them giving them much to discuss and not much to do. JR 20. Captain Marvel The hero take Its rare for a Marvel movie to have a twist and Captain Marvels isnt that complicated but its refreshing nonetheless. It just makes sense for the Skrulls a shapeshifting alien race always on the run and hiding out to be the more sympathetic side in the KreeSkrull war. The comics arent quite so neat and tidy when it comes to that. Then theres the more obvious reveal that Carol Danvers slimy male mentor was just trying to keep her down again not a surprise but still satisfying. The movie even manages to introduce a young Monica Rambeau one of the original heroes to use the Captain Marvel moniker in the comics and although her cameo is little more than a leadin to WandaVision Akira and Azari Akbars performances are too cute to deny. The villain take Its really just an Air Force recruitment ad. A lot of Marvel movies work with the U. S. military and make it look good but in this movie it somehow seems even more disgusting given the feminist themes and diverse cast. Uncle Sam will point his finger at anyone these days And thats progress folks. MM 19. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness The hero take The Sorcerer Supreme gets the Tales From the Crypt treatment thanks to the stylings of Sam Raimi who turns what would otherwise be a nonsensical chase through the Marvel multiverse into a slightly spooky romp with wonderfully imagined magical battles. The villain take For a premise that implies so much for the Marvel Cinematic Universe Multiverse of Madness is pretty gunshy about showing us the sheer possibility suggested in its title. Its biggest swing a secondact setpiece chockfull of cameos takes an exciting moment and drags it down with dull exposition. JR 18. Black Widow The hero take The main cast is excellent and almost all of them know how fun the movie theyre in should be some of the action is pretty good and Florence Pugh is in it shes enough fun that she gets her own special mention. The villain take It has one of the worst thirdact fights in MCU history and a completely perfunctory story that serves almost no larger purpose in the universe. AG 17. AntMan and the Wasp The hero take The smallstakes fun of AntMan times two. Theres a world where every Marvel movie is like the AntMan films and its not a bad one The stakes are small ha and personal superpowers are used for gags as much as they are for action and the focus is much more on the actors being people than they are soldiers or gods. The villain take AntMan and the Wasp kind of like its predecessor still feels a bit too small hee hee. The movie fails to make a strong impression even with an expanded supporting cast that includes the likes of Walton Goggins and Randall Park joining the the ant farm. JR 16. AntMan The hero take AntMan knows exactly what it is an action blockbuster helmed by a maybe Btier superhero who was mostly known to the wider public in a specific goofy way. Would that all movies could take that equation and multiply it by Paul Rudds innate charisma The villain take This was one of those MCU projects that seemed like it was going to be big and interesting initially given to Edgar Wright. Theres a sense that something got lost in the handoff to Peyton Reed a bit of a mishmash of tones that briefly provides a window into the wacky or wackier world that couldve been. Zosha Millman 15. Captain America Civil War The hero take Civil War has a lot to do. And yet its defining sequence the airport battle works because it manages to deliver on the actual groundwork of the characters letting them pingpong off each other in battle much better than they have in their signature Marvel Quips. The villain take Perhaps more so than most movies Civil War suffers from the core problem that couldve been solved with a single conversation making the fireandbrimstone concept of its subhead a bit overblown. Plus the MCU hasnt really done enough to build up any of the Avengers as friends so that the betrayal of this movie can hold together the way it does in the comic arc. ZM 14. Doctor Strange The hero take A rare MCU movie that requires all that CG and uses it well Doctor Strange is one of the betterlooking entries in the franchise eschews the typical thirdact formula and also does Tony Starks threemovie Iron Man arc in one movie. Also Scott Adkins is in it The villain take Redoing Tony Starks threemovie Iron Man arc in one movie can be read as a bad thing. The romance in the movie is also super underserved and additionally as a superfan of his the movie really has no idea what to do with Scott Adkins considerable martial arts prowess and screen presence which is a shame Pete Volk 13. SpiderMan Far From Home The hero take The Marvel Cinematic Universe has an overabundance of weirdo Silicon Valley assholes. When I learned the MCUs Quentin Beck aka Mysterio would have his awesome backstory bitter magician and illusionist swapped with something alltoofamiliar another Tony Stark knockoff I was in a word pissed. The only magic I expected to see was my interest in the MCU disappearing into thin air. How did I ever doubt midcareer Jake Gyllenhaal Fresh off bizarreass roles in Okja Velvet Buzzsaw Nightcrawler and Enemy Gyllenhaal delivers one of the most gleeful villain performances in a series known for dull baddies who exist to make some worldthreatening speech before getting punched through a skyscraper. The villain take Do I remember much about the story of Peter Parker and friends on a class trip around western Europe Of course not. But I cant forget Jake G. repeatedly trapping SpiderMan in holographic houses of mirrors. If the multiverse is just Gyllenhaals Mysterio will return. Though this time lets just make him a magician please. Chris Plante 12. Avengers Endgame The hero take The grand finale to a decade of storytelling Avengers Endgame both manages to conclude the Infinity Saga and celebrate it via a time heist revisiting pivotal moments in the canon. Its the kind of thing that only the MCU can do and it does it spectacularly. The villain take Its a little too good of an ending as theres never been a clearer jumpingoff point for the MCU than this. And while it does an admirable job of being a complete film of its own it can be very hard to be invested in the movies cosmic business without at least a passing familiarity of what came before. JR 11. ShangChi and the Legend of the Ten Rings The hero take Do you want to watch a decent little martial arts action movie with charming leads ShangChi has got you. The villain take Tony Leung is the most charming actor in this movie. Unfortunately hes the villain. Also everything winds up in a predictable Marvel CGI mush climax and a vague gesture in the direction of the future of the MCU. SP 10. The Avengers The hero take This is the film that proved Marvels grand storytelling experiment was going to work and then some. Assembling heroes and storylines from the whole first phase for an almighty teamup writerdirector Joss Whedon wore this difficult task lightly punching up the banter and the stakes for an apocalyptic scrap in New York. The Avengers still has some of the funniest lines and best action sequences of the entire MCU and some of the best Hulk content too. The villain take Pretty much the same as the case for. The Avengers irretrievably made smarmy Whedonisms a core pillar of the whole series but 10 years and dozens of movies later the quips are starting to grate while the man himself has fallen precipitously and justly out of fashion. The films profoundly influential mix of inert soap opera airpunching fan service and overburdened kitchensink structure is now our whole reality. Hope hes proud. Oli Welsh 9. Guardians of the Galaxy The hero take It takes a bit of buyin to James Gunns whole thing to get on board with Guardians of the Galaxy. But as the first MCU movie made to potentially lift right out if it needed to Guardians manages to be funnier tighter and more individual than the rapidly homogenizing MCU would become. The villain take Guardians tends to work better when you focus on the jokes not the larger McGuffiny plot of the whole thing. And if those jokes dont land well its not gonna be the best MCU entry for you. ZM 8. Black Panther Wakanda Forever The hero take A cinematic wake that mourns what could have been as director and cowriter Ryan Coogler bids farewell to the late Chadwick Boseman and TChalla the heroking he fully embodied from the moment he appeared on screen. Unfortunate circumstance makes Wakanda Forever the most painfully human film in the canon as it works through grief and the many ways its processed one that manifests in its conflict between Wakanda and the subaquatic nation of Talokan. The villain take The film simply takes on too much. Its conflict between Talokan king Namor and Wakanda is forced as actor Tenoch Huertas easy charisma crafts a character more sympathetic than the script intends. Diversions outside of Wakanda like a subplot involving CIA agent Everett Ross just dilute the films efforts and highlight how inadequate the MCU can be when it comes to grappling with anything this raw. JR 7. Iron Man 3 The hero take If the MCU did one thing right in its first couple of phases it was tracking Robert Downey Jr. s Tony Stark and his arc toward figuring out the right way to protect the world. He never quite does. But Iron Man 3 marks an important chapter for him addressing his central trauma character and reliance on superherodom and manages to be one of the most distinctive and complete parts of the MCU because of it. The villain take Its such a complete look at Tony that it almost seems silly we had to make him keep going after that ending Plus the less said about the handling of the Mandarin in this film ShangChi revisionism or no the better. ZM 6. Iron Man The hero take The movie that started it all Iron Man was the breakout success that launched the rest of the franchise in large part due to Robert Downey Jr. s charismatic performance that turned the arc of his career around. The villain take Its a boring movie visually set largely in vast open deserts without making much use of that space. It also asks you to sympathize with an arms dealer without really digging into what that means and while I support Jeff Bridges being in things his villain is one of the most straightforward examples of the classic Marvel problem of the hero but bad. PV 5. Captain America The First Avenger The hero take Director Joe Johnston had made a comic book adaptation 20 years prior Disneys The Rocketeer. Presumably that films mix of pulpy melodrama special effectsheavy action and 1930s period sets helped land him the Marvel gig. Captain America The First Avenger has that 1990s actioncomedy energy less selfaware and more earnest than the Marvel films to follow. The First Avenger would launch young talents like Chris Evans Sebastian Stan and Hayley Atwell but its the small army of established actors in the support roles that elevate this movie to the top of the list. Tommy Lee Jones Hugo Weaving Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones When I first saw the movie over a decade ago I remember leaving the theater saying They dont make them like this anymore. And Marvel hasnt ever since. The villain take The extended title The First Avenger announces the future of Marvel movies. This isnt just a Captain America flick its the story of an Avenger One problem The world had yet to see an Avengers film and their corresponding pop culture earthquakes. And so the subtitle served more as a promise of the future rather than a statement about the film folks would actually see in theaters. CP 4. SpiderMan Homecoming The hero take As the third modern Marvel liveaction feature introduction to the life and times of Peter Parker Homecoming couldve easily retread ground. Instead it made space for Tom Hollands SpiderMan to once again reintroduce himself in all his weird sometimes awkward often charming way. The villain take Look at the end of the day its still another SpiderMan and now hes a little bit tricked out like Iron Man. They do alright with the relationship between them but theres still a dizzying sense of the MCUs grander machinations at play here. ZM 3. Captain America The Winter Soldier The hero take Of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe offerings The Winter Soldier probably sustains the seriousness of its tone the best. As taut as MCU spy sequences come Winter Soldier understands the dynamics of its relationships enough to actually make them compelling even when penned in by the MCU blueprint. The villain take An actual spy thriller this is not. Again were still playing with Marvels rulebook here and theres only so much you can do there. Its also the first Marvel flick from the Russo brothers and yeah that shows on screen a bit. ZM 2. Thor Ragnarok The hero take Its a technicolor wonderland that takes the previously stodgy Thor and puts him in a buddy comedy with the Hulk a movie that shows just how elastic the MCU heroes can be without breaking. The villain take It is completely uninterested in building out Asgards story from previous movies quickly dismissing the last movies cliffhanger and effectively wiping it out of the MCU cosmos at the end just before giving it a compelling dark origin to reckon with. JR 1. Black Panther The hero take Take the triumph of The Avengers and imagine it applied to a single hero Thats Black Panther. What makes this film stand head and shoulders above the rest lies in intent The MCU in all its wild success is an insular project an exercise in careful canny brand management. Director Ryan Coogler manages to transcend this with Black Panther a film that isnt just a rousing solo effort for Marvels first Black superhero but a work of celebration the rare instance where a work of corporate representation does its best to love its fans back. The villain take The care and energy Coogler and the assembled cast bring to Black Panther isnt always matched by its superheroics most notably in the final battle between TChalla and the usurper Killmonger a brawl that is perhaps the most forgettable moment in the film. Thankfully its redeemed by one of the most memorable villain sendoffs in the MCU.

But if you arent completely tired of hearing him deliver headlinegrabbing soundbites head over to Empire to read a new interview which uses the fun gimmick of getting other famous people to ask him questions. Theres some amusing stuffCameron telling Edgar Wright not to sweat the Titanic parody he once made May we all be blessed with making films that get spoofs Harrison Ford and Pierce Brosnan asking why hes never cast them in anything Cameron is a fan of both actors but my great regret as a filmmaker is that I take so long to make my films that I only ever get to work with a tiny fraction of the artists that I respect and Cameron giving his take on the Papyrus font Saturday Night Live sketch in response to a question asked by the fonts actual creator. There are many questions about Terminator and The Abyss and Cameron confirming for Carrie Henn the former child actor who played Newt in Aliens that The Wizard of Oz is his favorite movie. Of particular interest however is the question from RRRs S. S. Rajamouliwho knows a thing or two about directing threehour action epics. He asked Cameron if he regrets spending so much time in the world of Avatar in the sense that it has prevented him from telling other stories and exploring other ideas. Two thoughts in answer to your question the first is that the world of Avatar is so sprawling that I can tell most of the stories I want to tell within it and try many of the stylistic techniques that I hope to explore Cameron responded. And secondly yes our time as artists is finite. I will always mourn some of the stories that I dont get to make. But I feel a great satisfaction when other directors want to explore some of my ideas like Kathryn Bigelow did with Strange Days and Robert Rodriguez did when I passed him the baton on Alita Battle Angel. I look forward to more collaborations in the future with directors I admire. Read the whole interview piece at Empire featuring an array of questions from people youd expect Robert Rodriguez Zoe Saldaa and more random admirers including the showrunners of The Lord of the Rings The Rings of Power and Stranger Things.

Everyones new favorite killer doll M3GAN debuted in theaters this weekendand building off great social media buzz and awareness grossed well above studio projections. As a result it seems a sequel is already in the works. Deadline first reported the news of the sequels development and io9 has followed up with Universal for further clarification or confirmation. Nevertheless with a reported budget of just 12 million before all that elaborate marketing of course and a firstweekend gross of 45 million worldwide including 30 million domestic the appetite for the funnycreepy AI killer doll is certainly there. The first film was written by Akela Cooper Malignant and directed by Gerard Johnstone Housebound from a story by Cooper and James Wan Saw Insidious who also produced with Jason Blum and others. Theres no word on who among that team might be returning but the film does end with a bit of a cliffhanger so youd imagine sequel thoughts have been dancing in their heads since well before release. In M3GAN a young girl named Cady Violet McGraw loses her parents and is forced to live with her aunt Gemma Allison Williams. Gemma struggles to connect with her niece and so she introduces her to an experimental doll shes been working on M3GAN who becomes so attached to the young girl shell kill for her. The film blends serious and silly themes in a very satisfying way with plenty of creepy kills throughout. If a sequel is already in the works one would assume Universal and Blumhouse would hope to strike while the iron is hot. Could we see M3GAN return next year sometime It seems possible though thats just speculation with a dash of wishful thinking. We just really want to see how M3GAN comes back and what she has in store next. Also whats it going to be called M3G4N M3GAN 2 Electric Boogaloo Give us your best guess b3low.

After a flurry of casting news that ranged from the strange to the surprisingly fitting weve not heard a thing about it even as some of its stars like Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Hart have had time in the press for other films. The film is still being made and directed by Hostels Eli Roth. But as far as reshoots are concerned Roths not handling those duties. According to Deadline outlets that recently reported that Roth was fired are overstating things Terminator Dark Fate director Tim Miller is stepping to handle the two weeks worth of additional shooting. At the moment Roth is busy directing the horror movie Thanksgiving based off a fake movie trailer from Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguezs 2007 film Grindhouse. Shooting for that film begins in March and Lionsgate with Roths approval opted to bring in Miller for the finish line. As previously stated Lionsgate has been trying its hardest to get a Borderlands movie into existence. The studio first announced a film adaptation in 2015 with Roth eventually signed on to direct and write the screenplay with eventual The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin. In the time its taken for the movie to come out the franchise has gradually made something of a comeback. Borderlands 3 released in 2019 seven years after the retail launch of Borderlands 2. In 2022 Gearbox released Tiny Tinas Wonderlands a Dungeons Dragonsthemed spinoff of the mainline games that sold like gangbusters and New Tales from the Borderlands Gearboxs follow up to the 2014 choicedriven interactive adventure game from the now defunct Telltale games. If and when that Borderlands movie comes out itll be interesting to see what kind of position the franchise is in by that point and what comes out of the series in the aftermath of the films release.

How do you make the undead feel fresh and fun in todays market According to Zom 100 Bucket List of the Dead you use them as an excuse to quit your job. The new anime from production company Bug Films Komi Cant Communicate and director Kazuki Kawagoe Beyblade Komi Cant Communicate is set in a city beset by a zombie apocalypse that seems to have no way of being stopped. For most people that would be when you either try to flee or become a helpless victim but for office worker Akira Tendo this is just the right time to get out of his dead end office job. Instead of fretting over bills and hating himself for not having the courage to ask out his coworker Akira decides to say YOLO and accomplish all 100 items on his bucket list before he inevitably becomes zombie chow or a casualty of the militarys efforts against the horde. Zom 100 is based on a manga of the same name by Haro Aso Alice in Borderland and Kotaro Takata. Since its debut in 2018 the Zom 100 manga has received a solid critical reception and was nominated for an Eisner in 2022. Along with the anime Netflix is behind a liveaction adaptation of the film to be directed by Yusuke Ishida Shin Godzilla Attack on Titan. Thats also expected to drop this year though the streamer hasnt announced a release date for it yet. Meanwhile the anime version of Zom 100 Bucket List of the Dead will be releasing its first season on Hulu starting in July. Peep the first poster down below.

Or does it Despite what it clearly says on the new poster seen below JeanLuc Picard himself had some vaguely teasing remarks on the subject. As Deadline reports Patrick Stewart doesnt sound totally ready to say farewell to his longrunning character even after the end of season three There is still enormous potential for matters in what we can do and there are doors left open and we didnt close all of them he said. Executive producer Alex Kurtzman had a similar statement in the vagueyethopeful vein anything is possible... if the show blows the doors off the place and were certainly hoping it will as were very proud of season three who knows. So many door metaphors and a bit of deja vu too. Who knows... what exactly A completely different Star Trek series that just so happens to pull Picard into the story from time to time Some manner of Picard spinoff which would be a spinoff of a spinoff A Picard Holiday Special If season three of Picard takes the world by storm and Stewart is still willing to play the character you have to assume anything is hypothetically possible. Season three of Picard will be a Star Trek Next Generation reunion of sorts with LeVar Burton Michael Dorn Jonathan Frakes Gates McFadden Marina Sirtis Brent Spiner Jeri Ryan and Michelle Hurd filling out the cast alongside Stewart. Terry Matalas who coshowran season two with Akiva Goldsman is the sole showrunner on season three.

For Cameron its a sign that people have had enough with the streaming already But... have they Speaking to Variety last night during the Golden Globes digital preshow Cameron said he saw The Way of Waters success as a repudiation of streaming and a reembrace of theatrical releases Were going back to theaters around the world. Theyre even going back to theaters in China where theyre having this big covid surge. Were saying as a society We need this We need to go to theaters. Enough with the streaming already Im tired of sitting on my ass. First of all it seems James Cameron does not actually know how to watch a theatrical release because people tend to sit down to watch movies wherever they are. Second its worth noting that The Way of Water is the sequel to literally the highestgrossing movie of all time and its currently only available to see in theaters. Of course its doing well but theres no way to know how many people would have elected to stay home to watch it if that option had been available. But Im going to give Cameron and the film credit here. I believe if Avatar The Way of Water had been made available on say HBO Max the same day it premiered in theaters most people would still have left their homes to see it. Why Well 95 percent of the draw of the Avatar movies is their visual spectacle which can be best experienced in theatersbut more importantly that visual spectacle is best enjoyed in 3D which again is only available outside the home unless youre one of the 29 people who bought 3D TVs back in 2011 or so. Also James The fact that people in China are going to watch TWoW in theaters during a covid surge isnt a good thing. Either way maybe a world where bigtime movies get released in theaters andor home streaming services is okay and we dont need to judge people for preferring one or keep predicting the death of one at the others hands. But we can judge Cameron for saying a weird gaffe that made it sound like he doesnt know people watch movies sitting down.

He continued to explain an idea he hit on in that moment. And then I was like But if you guys are actually going to do a spinoff it should be this. And then I said it and the Duffers looked at each other and looked at me and they were like Could we talk to you for a second And then they pulled me off and they were like That is the idea. Who told you and I was like No one and they were like What do you mean You just came up with it and I was like Well no I just thought that that would be a cool way to expand.

And at the end of the day all that hard work paid off not only has M3GAN gotten pretty good reviews its doing better than expected in terms of financials. Per Variety the film has earned 45 million worldwide and the bulk of that is stateside. At time of writing North American metrics have it at 30. 2 million well above the 1720 million expectations. The remaining 14. 8 million has been from international audiences but regardless the films made its cash back and then some. In fact its the first movie in over a decade to release in the first week of January and earn over 30 million domesticallythe last film to do so was The Devil Inside back in 2012 for 33. 7 million. Even with that surprise overperformance Avatar The Way of Water was the top theatrical movie for the weekendit earned an extra 45 million putting its global total at 1. 7 billion. But its still a solid victory for M3GAN again Universals been going out of its way to market this thing via social media mainly having M3gan pick fights with Screams Ghostface and Childs Plays Chucky on Twitter and viral videos. Marketing a movie it works As Universals domestic distribution president Jim Orr said Wordofmouth is through the roof. That word of mouth may be key to the rest of M3GANs theatrical tenure as Janaury is actually fairly stocked with movies. Next week sees the release of the Gerard ButlerMike Colter teamup film Plane yes its really called that and Blumhouses COVID thriller Sick.

Researchers inside Netflix identified password sharing as a major problem eating into subscriptions in 2019 people familiar with the situation say but the company was worried about how to address it without alienating consumers. Then Covid lockdowns hit bringing a wave of new subscribers and the effort to scrutinize sharing petered out. More than 100 million Netflix viewers now watch the service using passwords they borrow often from family members or friends the company says. Netflix has said that it will put an end to that arrangement starting in 2023 asking people who share accounts to pay to do so. The company expects to begin rolling out the change in the U.

It would have been the 25th issue of the acclaimed comic book series published by Eclipse…,https://boingboing.net/2022/12/29/after-nearly-30-years-theres-finally-a-new-issue-of-miracleman-by-neil-gaiman.html,This week saw the highly anticipated publication of Miracleman The Silver Age 3 by Neil Gaiman and Mark Buckingham nearly 30 years after it was supposed to come out. It would have been the 25th issue of the acclaimed comic book series published by Eclipse Comics if the company hadnt been abruptly gone under leaving the completed comic book in limbo for a long long time. Remarkably thats only one of the many many publication complications this mighty superhero has faced over the years. That full epic journey is chronicled in rich detail in Pdraig Malids Poisoned Chalice The Extremely Long and Incredibly Complex Story of Marvelman and Miracleman and its a fascinating microcosm of the history of comic books and intellectual property rights. I will do my best here to try and summarize that beautiful clusterfuck if for not other reason than that I find it delightfully convoluted. After DC Comics began publishing Superman other companies came up with their own bermensches to try and compete. Fawcett Comics introduced Captain Marvel aka Shazam which quickly became more popular than Superman. DC sued Fawcett for copyright infringement but the legal battle dragged on for a while. In the meantime a British publisher called L. Miller Sons began publishing reprints of the Shazam Captain Marvel. Eventually DC won their lawsuit which meant Fawcett could no longer publish Captain Marvel which left L. Miller Sons in a pickle. So they quickly created Marvelman as a blatant knockoff of Shazam Captain Marvel so they could continue publishing without concern about rights or losing readership. Seriously its not subtle instead of transforming when he says the word Shazam Marvelmans magic word is atomic but backwards. They both have kid sidekicks whose names are just kid versions of the main heroes who get their own powers by speaking the heros name. Eventually L. Miller Sons shuttered too meanwhile Marvel decided to cash in on that sweet trademark and publish their own Captain Marvel comic which also featured a superpowered hero who transformed his body through fantastical means in this case bracelets instead of a magic word. Some 15 years later another British publisher bought the rights to Marvelman and hired Alan Moore to rejuvenate the brand but things got complicated again when they tried to publish the Marvelman reboot in the US thanks to Marvel. So they renamed Marvelman into Miracleman. The US publisher Eclipse Comics went bankrupt in 1994 shortly after Neil Gaiman took over writing duties on Miracleman. At some point Todd MacFarlane claimed he owned the character which led to further legal disputes and the book and character were left in legal limbo until 2013 when Marvel bought the rights to the character formerly known as Marvelman. Bonus irony shortly after publication of Miracleman DC Comics eventually bought the rights to the entire Charlton Comics catalog and brought in Alan Moore to reinvigorate a few of those characters including Peacemaker Blue Beetle The Question and Captain Atom which eventually turned into Watchmen. Which in addition to being a great comic was also the first of many instances where the comic book publishing industry would totally fuck over Alan Moore. Comics everybody I was at the ComicCon when Marvel made their big announcement that they had obtained the rights to Miracleman. I was very confused I was not familiar with the character nor had I realized Alan Moore had worked on it and didnt understand why anyone would care about this blatant Shazam ripoff. Writereditor Sam Thielman recently wrote a piece about Miracleman for Slate that made me curious enough to finally check it out and holy shit this is some fantastic comics. Moore and later Gaiman was so far ahead of the trend of What if superheroes existed in the real world If youve ever wondered for example why doesnt Superman just put a stop to every war well thats exactly what Miracleman does. And the resulting consequences from seeing a superhero usher in a utopian society through force is some seriously exciting stuff that unfortunately was never fully explored for the aforementioned reasons until now. Another curious bonus irony is that the last issue of Miracleman that was published in 1993 ended with the shocking cliffhanger of Miracleman kissing Young Miracleman at the behest of Miraclewoman. Which is worked well in the story as an exploration of changing norms around society and sex and superheroes but is also much less edgy and shocking in the 2020s. Similarly its neat seeing how Buckingham had originally drawn the pages 30 years ago and comparing them to how hes remastered and redone the pages now. This is all to say Im a recent convert to the church of Miracleman and even I felt those decades of anticipation building up as I opened up the latest issue of the story. Im excited to see what comes next and how this 30yearold story ends up picking up in medea res. The layers of metatext in this continuing story make for an incredible retrospective on the entire history of the superhero genre. If you like superheroes and fascinating realworld metatext you should check out Miracleman too.,2022-12-29T18:34:08Z,No Headline,Extremely Negative,230,"problem, worried, risks, risks",-,-,-

Since the advent of the Marvel cinematic universe several studios have taken a stab at creating their own interconnected film series. Currently Warner Brothers Discoverys CEO David Zaslav has made it his personal mission to rectify the sorry state of DC Comics film division. However even though DCs film brand pales in comparison to Marvels output its still infinitely better than Universals Dark Universe as the series is only comprised of a single film. On paper the idea of connecting all of Universals monsters to act as a counterpoint to Marvels superhero universe makes perfect sense. The idea becomes all the more enticing when you remember that Universal was actually the first studio to have an interconnected movie universe. In the video linked above the YouTuber Daniel Netzel explains how Universals failed Dark Universe couldve become a brilliant cinematic series akin to Marvel.,2022-12-20T15:25:48Z,"After nearly 30 years, there's finally a new issue of Miracleman by Neil Gaiman",Somewhat Positive,530,"issue, abruptly, convoluted, sued, infringement, dragged, blatant, concern, losing, complicated, bankrupt, confused, blatant, ripoff, unfortunately, issue, shocking, shocking, issue","fuck, shit, sex, church","Neil, Gaiman, Mark, Buckingham, Superman, Captain, Marvel, Shazam, Superman, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit, Fawcett, Captain, Marvel, Alan, Moore, Neil, Gaiman, Todd, MacFarlane, lawsuit, lawsuit, Alan, Moore, Captain, Atom, Alan, Moore, Alan, Moore, Shazam, Sam, Thielman, Miracleman, Moore, Gaiman, Superman, Miracleman, Miracleman, Miraclewoman, Buckingham",-
43,Breaking down the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania trailer,"From actor Corey Stoll’s MODOK to Kang to Yellowjacket, here’s everything we noticed in Marvel’s Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania trailer. And hang on... is Scott Lang gonna die?",https://www.polygon.com/23547316/ant-man-wasp-quantumania-trailer-breakdown-modok-actor-kang,A new trailer for AntMan and The Wasp Quantumania gives Marvel fans a big little look at the next installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe which is only about a month away. Its not an AntMan trailer like any weve seen before being short on jokes and long on angst but lets dig into those details before Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly return for the third and presumably final AntMan movie in February. Grab your magnifying glass. Scott wants to turn back time but why After spending five Blipped years away a pivotal chunk of his teenage daughters life its no surprise that Scott Lang is willing to trust someone as obviously evil as Kang to get more time. But considering hes bringing his whole family to the Quantum Realm its also possible that something happens in the movie that could cause Scott to be willing to turn back time no matter what the cost. The Quantum Realm is a long way from home The Quantum Realm gets a little bigger in every AntMan movie going from a kind of scary purgatory in the first to an inhabitable land in the second and finally a fullblown universe full of hightech cities in the third. Of course the only problem with this universe is that Kang the Conqueror appears to control it. MODOK While D23 audiences saw him back in September this is the first time the rest of us have gotten a look at MODOK evil genius grotesque laboratory experiment and among the best beloved Marvel supervillains for being so awful. In Quantumania he appears to be played by Corey Stoll who portrayed the villainous Yellowjacket in 2015s AntMan where he was ultimately dispatched by being forced to shrink uncontrollably and presumably into the Quantum Realm. MODOK first appeared in 1967s Tales of Suspense 94 created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing took over the mad scientist organization that created him. Despite his genuinely awful visual deal hes one of Marvel Comics foremost joke villains as explored in Hulus recent MODOK animated series. Kang goes full Kirby Speaking of villains designed for comics not movies the trailer gives us a better look at how the MCU will make Jonathan Majors Kang into the next Avengerslevel threat while paying homage to the characters original alien visage. Why does Kang have seams on his face Dont worry about it it looks cool. Does Scott die at the end This trailer goes heavy on the foreshadowing almost aggressively teasing Scotts death at the end of this movie. Now its possible that this is an attempt at clever misdirection on the part of Marvel teeing up Scott to die only to reverse it or pull a reverse in the end for a more shocking demise. On the other hand it makes a lot of sense that this could be Scotts last movie. Cassies an adult now and a better fit agewise for the upandcoming MCU class and with a trilogy concluded and an only barely tenuous place in the Avengers Scott doesnt exactly feel like a critical piece to Phase 5 and 6 of the MCU. Plus his death would set up some pretty huge stakes to help lead us into the next two Avengers movies where the team will have to face off with Kang.,2023-01-10T17:20:00Z,This video explains how Universal's Dark Universe could have been great,Somewhat Positive,50,"Dark, stab, sorry, pales, Dark, Dark",-,"David, Zaslav, Daniel, Netzel",polygon

Prior to the original XMen and SpiderMan films in the 2000s The Hulk was arguably Marvels most mainstream character. The outstanding 1970s series The Incredible Hulk helped cement the character in pop culture for decades. Naturally when Marvel decided to create their own film studio the Hulk was one of the first characters greenlit for a solo adventure. Unfortunately 2008s Incredible Hulk was the last solo Hulk movie Marvel has produced relegating Bruce Banner to a supporting character without a franchise to call his own. Similar to Namor The Hulks film rights are tangled up at Universal as the studio owns the distribution rights to the character. Consequently a Hulk movie seemed like an impossibility for years. According to Comicbook. com theres a rumor that Marvel is trying to set the stage for a Hulk movie based on the epic World War Hulk comic run. A suspected Marvel production company is teasing a World War Hulkmovie. My Cosmic Circus reports that Shadowstone Productions LLC is indeed working as Marvel Studios. Tracking working titles and trying to determine what they could be referring to is a wellworn practice among MCU obsessives. Sometimes there are character bits in there and other times there are more outright allusions to glean. At any case Shadowstone is a rareEarth mineral in Marvel Comics. Now why does that matter for World War Hulk Well that rock was used to craft the ship that brought Hulk back to his home planet to seek revenge against the Avengers who sent him away during Civil War. SheHulkhas already established Hulks son Skaar and teased a Red Hulk emergence. Couple that with the information we have that Harrison Ford is set to play General Thunderbolt Ross in Captain America New World Orderand the picture becomes even clearer. It seems like Bruce Banner might be getting back to those savage times with even his nemesis The Leader being the primary antagonist of Cap 4. All the dots are lining up but nothing official has been revealed by the company yet.,2022-12-24T13:50:49Z,Breaking down the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania trailer,Extremely Negative,660,"evil, scary, problem, evil, grotesque, awful, villainous, awful, joke, villains, villains, threat, worry, misdirection, shocking, demise, critical","Killing, die, death, die, adult, death","Paul, Rudd, Evangeline, Lilly, Scott, Scott, Lang, Scott, Kang, the, Conqueror, Corey, Stoll, Yellowjacket, Stan, Lee, Jack, Kirby, Kang, Kirby, Jonathan, Majors, Kang, Kang, Scott, Scotts, Scott, Scotts, Scott, Kang",-
45,Jeremy Renner: Avengers actor out of surgery but still in critical condition,The actor suffered blunt chest trauma and orthopaedic injuries in a snow plough accident at his home.,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-64149476,Jeremy Renner Avengers actor out of surgery but still in critical condition Published US actor Jeremy Renner is out of surgery but remains in a critical condition after an accident with a snow plough his publicist has said. Renner suffered blunt chest trauma and orthopaedic injuries and is still in intensive care Samantha Mast said in a statement to US media on Monday night. He was airlifted to hospital on Sunday after an accident while clearing snow outside his home in Nevada. The US has been battered by snowstorms killing dozens of people. Jeremys family would like to express their gratitude to the incredible doctors and nurses looking after him publicist Ms Mast said in a statement. The family also thanked the local police and fire services and said they were tremendously overwhelmed and appreciative of the outpouring of love and support from his fans. Before the accident Renner was reportedly clearing a road outside his home in Reno Nevada using his personal snow plough so his family could get out after a heavy storm. The 51yearold was the only person involved in the incident the Washoe County Sheriffs office said adding that it was being investigated. US celebrity news site TMZ reported that Renner was aided by neighbours at the scene one of whom was a doctor. His family thanked the Carano and Murdock families in their statement. A day after the accident news emerged that rally driving champion Ken Block was killed when his snowmobile flipped at his ranch in Utah. The US was battered by a major snowstorm over the New Year weekend with at least 60 people in eight states killed. Thousands of homes experienced power cuts and travel was severely disrupted. Twotime Oscar nominee Renner is best known for his role as Clint BartonHawkeye in the Marvel cinematic universe starring in several Avengers films and in the spinoff television series Hawkeye. He was nominated for an Academy Award for best actor for his role in The Hurt Locker in 2008 and for best supporting actor in The Town in 2010.

When David Zaslavs Warner Brothers Discovery announced that James Gunn would lead the struggling film studio fans were elated. Gunns Marvel pedigree practically ensured DC loyalists that brighter days were finally coming after the blackest nights of the Snyderverse. Now only a month later fans are back to decrying every decision DCs film division makes and insulting Gunns ideas online. The proverbial straw that broke the camels back was Gunns decision to recast Superman. Henry Cavill who recently returned to the role in Octobers Black Adam had become synonymous with the character and Gunns choice to let him go caused alarms to go off for millions of fans. Around the same time Patty Jenkins exited Wonder Woman 3 over creative differences placing Gal Gadots future involvement with DC in doubt. However James Gunn recently took to social media to let fans know he didnt let Gal Gadot go. The ambiguity of his statement doesnt make it clear if shell continue to play Wonder Woman in the future or if Gunn hasnt let her go yet. Only time will tell. Many fans have speculated that with the axing of the third installment of the Wonder Womanfilm Gal Gadot had been booted from DC. However Gunn provided some clarity about Gadot and where she currently stands. Im not sure where youre getting that we booted Gal Gunn replied. Gunns response could be interpreted in two ways 1. Gadot is still working with DC for a future Wonder Woman appearance or 2. Gadot left DC on her own accord amid the shakeup.,2022-12-21T14:28:24Z,Jeremy Renner: Avengers actor out of surgery but still in critical condition,Generally Neutral,290,"critical, critical, suffered, blunt, trauma, battered, overwhelmed, battered, Hurt, joke","killing, fire, killed, killed","Jeremy, Renner, Jeremy, Renner, Renner, Samantha, Mast, Jeremys, Ms, Mast, Renner, Renner, Carano, Murdock, Ken, Block, Renner, Clint, BartonHawkeye",-

But while there are still plenty of plans in the works it might take a little longer to get round to them thanks to Warner Bros. heaping pile of mess lately. The latest update on the world of Game of Thrones spinoffs comes of course courtesy of perpetual updater George R. R. Martin who loves to tell you when and if he will provide an update on either his work or adaptations of his work at any available opportunity. Writing on his blog Not A Blog the Song of Ice and Fire author offered an update on a few of the adaptations of not just his fantasy work but things like Peacocks take on his scifi series Wild Cards. But now I am back in the salt mine working working on so many bloody things my head may soon explode. Yes Winds of Winter yes yes. And House of the Dragon season two. And several of the other successor shows that were developing with HBO Martin wrote before explaining that this summers tumult at HBO Max has significantly altered the plans for what we might see out of Westeros in the far future. Some of those are moving faster than others as is always the case with development. None have been greenlit yet though we are hoping maybe soon. A couple have been shelved but I would not agree that they are dead. You can take something off the shelf as easily as you can put it on the shelf Martin continued. All the changes at HBO Max have impacted us certainly. We are also still developing the Wild Cards tv series for Peacock based largely on FORT FREAK. And I have Wild Cards books to edit. Oh and did I forget Winds of Winter No of course I didnt. But if I ever did I know you folks will remind me. Beyond House of the Dragon all we know about potential future Game of Thrones spinoffs are the aforementioned Dunk and Egg seriesadapting Martins novellas following the adventures of hedge knight Duncan the Tall and his squire Egg secretly Aegon V Targaryenand a sequel series set after the conclusion of Game of Thrones following Kit Haringtons Jon Snow. Martin makes it sound like even more couldve been on the way but are now on the backburner. But like the author says these things can be put on and hold and taken off at any timeand given House of the Dragons strong debut this year many of the doubts that Game of Thrones controversial legacy could entire people back to Westeros have been proven wrong. One thing that isnt in doubt though well probably have to wait a very long time to see what else Martin and Warner Bros. have planed for A Song of Ice and Fires televisual future.

But in doing so they have opened a very different kind of Pandoras box than presumably whatever Jake put Neytiris gift in for Christmas. The official Avatar YouTube channel has released 12 Days of Christmas a Pandoran Christmas Carol to celebrate the Yuletide and the existence of an Avatar movie at the box office again. Alas unlike practically any decision James Cameron has made about opening his mouth when it comes to The Way of Water in the last few weeks it is a video of profound cowardice because instead of having anyone actually sing the Pandoran lyrics to 12 Days of Christmas its just an instrumental of the classic carol. What you couldnt even ask the Weeknd Anyway thats not the thing that has set my mind agog about 12 Days of Christmas a Pandoran Christmas Carol. I mean it is that but its primarily the everything else about it too. Who is this for when the lyrics include not just character names you can barely remember because theyre largely from the first movie 13 years ago instead of The Way of Water but even include deep cuts for the Avatar heads out there who remember characters like Sylwanin Neytiris dead sister only mentioned in the extended cut of the original film Why is this happening other than the fact that its the week before Christmas and James Cameron wants Avatar to be absolutely everywhere But also what does it mean that there is a Pandoran version of a Christmas song Did the humans bring Christmas with them when they came to Pandora Did Jake try to carry on the tradition after he decided to stay on the world and raise a family with Neytiri Did Jake and the remaining humans singlehandedly spread the idea of Christmas to the Forest Navi And if so which version the commercialized holiday or the Christian theology behind it Do the Navi have an awareness of who Santa Claus or Jesus Christ are Did anyone at any point in the making of literally any detail about the worldbuilding of the Avatar franchise let alone this specific moment stop to consider the colonial undercurrent of introduction Earth holidays to a species with its own widely adopted spiritualism I dont know.

Its a complicated undertaking since the show takes inspiration from not only Leigh Bardugos original Shadow and Bone trilogy but also the Six of CrowsCrooked Kingdom duology. The showrunners told Entertainment Weekly that season two covers multiple books and touches on deep cut plotlines that not even Bardugo saw coming. Shadow and Bone wont return to Netflix until early spring so the showrunners kept mum on the details beyond thatthough they were willing to say that the second season will cover the second book in the Shadow trilogy Siege and Storm and will include some events of the third book Ruin and Rising. And while the characters from Six of Crows famously made an appearance in the first season of Shadow and Bone Heisserer and Fryklind say that the plot of the duology will require its own lane so fans can expect a similar mashing of plots in a way that creates a unique and more nuanced look at the Young Adult series. The blending of both the middle YA Shadow and Bone trilogy Six of Crows duology which remains a pair of my favorite fantasy books they are that exceptional was one of the best parts of the show. It elevated the source material and provided an easy impetus for change giving all the characters a richer storyline. Heisserer and Fryklind told the magazine theyre excited to show off the new storyline which will include Nikolia Latntsov Patrick Gibson the grisha twins Tamar KirBataar Anna Leong Brophy and Tolya YulBataar Lewis Tan and Wylan Hendriks Jack Wolfe. There will be nods to the Crows storyline but they are saving the Ice Court job for another season. While its true that this is the main plot of the second Crows book the first books plotline is centered on a plot to create an artificial amplification drug jura parem for the grisha based on a plant that has a fictional positioning not unlike opium. With multiple storylines in the new season there will be more ways in which the threads of the books tie themselves together in the television seriesand from what they could reveal the showrunners sound committed to having fun and creating a cohesive story that embellishes and adds to the plot of the original series of books.

Sure I knew the horniness between Jim Carreys Grinch and Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier is one for the agesa chemistry that could have put the movie over the top if not for Howards sincere depiction of it. But no its a quick moment that for one reason or another I overlooked in the Universal Pictures family movie the fishbowl with keys at the window. Thats rightwhen Grinch Baby gets stuck on a tree branch on his mothers home hes left out in the cold to gaze upon a Whoville swingers party. Sure at first watch during childhood this is just like wow hes left outside while they have a Christmas party but no the Whos are high on some sort of WhoHash while riding each other like ponies filled with concupiscent cheer. And this is the look on Baby Grinchs face while it goes down Its wild that this fantasy world obsessed with their holiday feasts filled with whopudding drew the line at accepting the different looking green furry child. As youths Martha and the Grinch definitely had a forbidden awakening about one another that for the bully and future mayor was enough to ostracize him out of society to have Martha for himself. But that crush only simmers within Whovier who reminisces lustfully about the young Grinchs chaotic nature and strength to Cindy Lou Who the films child protagonist who wants to reintegrate the him into Who society. Shes literally thinking about him aloud when she delivers the muscles in the horniest way possible. The woman is addicted to materialism because she cant have the Grinch. And the Grinch is outcast so he wont take the girl the mayor gaslights to be with him away. The Grinch even still harbors his attraction despite saying before accepting the invite Shell be on me like flies on a flugalhorse. Sorry Martha Baby the GTrain has already left the station. but has it After everything that goes down you know he still harbors feelings for Martha even when invited to the whobillation. The tension they exude at one another when he appears to accept his invitation to the Whobillation is thick. At one point when she faints from sheer desire for the Big Green Mean One. Waking up to say Oh wow. For real thats some heavy comedic forbidden lust played up expertly by Carrey and Baranski thats barely restrained by the grace of Ron Howard. I mean this movie is still preferred to the 2018 animated bore for a reason. Anyways can we also talk about Marthas fits The sheer weight she carries while she bodies those Christmas looks also carries the movie as an alltimer. Its a whole other movie as an adult beyond the Dr. Seuss story adaptation you remember as a kid. Make no mistake those two want to fuck. Truly the fishbowl being the first thing Grinch baby sees sets him up to desire Martha May as he enters adulthood. And yes the true meaning of Christmas being something that cant be bought in a store is the core of what gets the Grinch to come around but come on... Martha May Whovier is also right there. His heart growing three sizes that day is a helpful gift for her later.

Today io9 has a sneak peek of the mecha action starting with this synopsis A brandnew story kicks off this collection of tales of mecha monsters heroic hijinks and actionpacked adventure In Super Mecha Teens a giant monster threatens to attack Riverdale and only one teen with some robot help can save the day. Unfortunately that teen is Archie Andrews. But he doesnt have to do it alone But who does he choose Betty with her rugged selfbuilt mech or Veronica with her hitech hiend robotics As all the mechs are being mauled by the monster Archie must decide in this story thats equal parts Transformers and Pacific Rim. Ive been asking the editors if I could write an Archie mecha story for literal years and I hope its not our last one. Anyone who reads this will hopefully see how much worldbuilding we put into it and all the possibilities of hurling the Archie cast into these genre conventions Kibblesmith said in a statement to io9. Its crazy how perfectly these characters click into this kind of story but as always that malleability is the magic of Archie comics. Whats left to say Get in the robot Archie. Kibblesmith also had high praise for the artist. Ryans love for this stuff clearly shines through. Its so passionate and informed you really see the complete aesthetic of this world in such a short glimpse. Jampole was just as excited to work on the story as Kibblesmith. Designwise I really wanted to pay homage to the giant mecha manga say that three times fast and anime that I grew up readingwatching and still do he said in a statement to io9. Theres some Mazinger a pinch of Evangelion a dash of GoLion a sprinkle of Tetsujin 28. I think the story is so well written that it can be for everyone but if youre a fan of the mecha genre youre really gonna get a kick out of it As you can tell the artist is a big fan of the new comics inspiration. Anyone who knows me knows I love manga and Archie has been really cool with letting me stretch those manga visual storytelling muscles lately injecting those sensibilities into the classic Archie stories Jampole said. And I think it all lead to this story cuz its the comic Ive been preparing to draw since I could pick up a penit helps that the script is fantastic too. It really is one of my favorite stories I got to work on If you love Archiewhich you shouldand you love giant robotswhich you shouldthen youll love this story Archie Friends All Action arrives April 5.

Slaters career has spanned decades and includes some of our most beloved films and shows. Hes the kind of actor who if theyre in a project instantly makes you more excited about it. However previous to this weekand with over half the season finishedthe actor had yet to make his debut. That changed with Prisoners of Skellin which not only featured Slater but featured him in a key role that linked the story of the original Willow film with this new show. A few weeks back io9 spoke with Willow showrunner Jon Kasdan who told us why Slater was cast and what the role means to the series. In the episode Slater plays Allagash a friend of Val Kilmers movie character Madmartigan who joined him on a daring adventure to secure the legendary armor called the Kymerian Cuirass. The pair along with Madmartigans steward Boorman Amar ChadhaPatel searched for the Cuirass for three years leading them to Wiggleheims tomb in the troll mountain of Skellin. Madmartigan entered the tomb never to return and Allagash told the trolls he was Madmartigan so that his friend could continue the quest without being chased. Sounds like a fun movie right Well thats what Kasdan had in mind when casting the pivotal role. The idea immediately once we saw where we were going with this is there was a movie you never got to see Kasdan told io9. It came out in 1992 and it was The Adventures of Madmartigan and it had Madmartigan leading a team of adventurers on a daring quest. And we thought Who would be in that movie And Christian was the first name that popped into our heads. It was that pitch that Kasdan used to lure Slater in. The first thing I told Christian when I was finally able to get him on the phone was exactly what I just told you Kasdan said. And he said Absolutely man I would have been in that movie in a heartbeat. Whats amazing about Christian is he has a real genuine love of genre Kasdan continues. He loves this kind of adventure story. He loves Star Wars he loves swashbucklers and scoundrels and hes been waiting to play one. So it was sort of serendipitous when this role emerged and we wanted someone who could fill in some of the gaps in what happened to Madmartigan and what that quest would be. But the first and most obvious thing about it was that that person would not be someone we could trust. He would have to be a real con man and a double dealer and out for himself in every way. And that was the second thing I explained to Christian. And he was even more in because he does that naturally. Slater is excellent in the episode portraying this duplicitous boisterous but ultimately selfless man who we think may sacrifice himself for the other heroes. Well have to wait and see if he survives or if thats it but either way Slater on Willow is a huge highlight of the season. Well have more from Kasdan and his cast as we reach the end of the season.

The financial success of those films transformed them both into consistent franchises and allowed Wan to direct nonhorror crowd pleasers like Furious 7 and more recently Aquaman. But even when hes not directing horror hes still got one foot in the genre as next weeks M3GAN With so many franchises under Wans belt youd be right in thinking that M3GAN may be the start of another series. Not a bad time to put out a horror franchise based on a murderous toy But in a recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter the filmmaker said that he was superstitious and was currently keeping his focus solely on this first film. I dont like to talk about sequels before the first film is even out he said. But like any of the movies I make I always think of a bigger world.... So if were fortunate enough to tell any other stories we can pull from the bigger world. M3GAN comes from a story he made with Akela Cooper his cocollaborator on 2021s Malignant. Of their recent teamups Wan called Cooper brave and a writer with a similar talent as him for being not afraid to just go out there lean into the absurd and make it work.... She can take an idea thats really outside of the box and bring a human element to it. That was the mission statement for M3GAN he added and it seems like the two will be working together for a good while as Coopers written next years sequel to The Nun Malignant Through his Atomic Monster label Wan is producing M3GAN with Blumhouses Jason Blum and it appears that partnership may be leading to a merger between the two where they continue to exist as separate labels. When asked about it by the Hollywood Reporter Blum did admit that advanced talks were in the works and though hes hopeful itll happen nothing has been written in ink quite yet. Should it go through though it may end up leading to a sequel for Blumhouses 2020 Invisible Man reboot. Blum was hopeful that Wan could get that off the ground and the latter added that hed be more than happy to get that going.

AntMan and the Wasp Quantumania In conversation with Nerdbunker director Peyton Reed confirmed Cassie Lang is now eighteen years old in AntMan and the Wasp Quantumania. When Paul and I started on the first movie it was the question of will audiences accept Paul Rudd as a superhero Will people accept AntMan a guy who shrinks and controls ants as a character And they have. And thats really gratifying and I think audiences really relate to Scott Lang because he doesnt have superpowers hes not a superscientist hes not a billionaire. Hes a regular person who just happens to get caught up in these adventures. But I think weve all grown and what we want to do with the movies and how we see the character the family dynamics to us after the events of Avengers Infinity War and Endgame it really occurred to us obviously Well Cassies going to be 18 in this movie thats great. The whole theme is time and how much time hes missed and his main motivation is just I want time with my daughter. And now hes coming into contact with a villain in this movie Kang the Conqueror who has dominion over time and what does that mean to them Terrifier 3 Damien Leone stated he hopes to recapture the creep factor of his original Art the Clown short film as well as top poor Allies horrific demise in Terrifier 3.

I have a pretty darn good resume so to say the least this is the best role for me that Ive ever had. The scale of this guy. Honestly the scale of this man is incredible. Hes not to be messed with. This is gonna be a thrill ride. Love him hate him but its not the typical villain. Hes very layered. And you root for this man because he makes a lot of sense and hes done a lot of amazing things to transform South Metropolis and so you just get to take this thrill ride. Poker Face Speaking with Empire about his new mystery series Rian Johnson discussed the difficulty he faced writing Natasha Lyonnes character Charlie Cale who possesses the preternatural ability to know when people are lying to her. It presented an interesting obstruction in the writing process how is it not over in the first five minutes of talking to the person Charlie gives this monologue in the pilot about how people are constantly lying. You have to pay attention to whythe person is lying about that specific thing. I really love the accidental detective. You know the person who stumbles into a life of solving things just because their brain works that way.

Plus Guillermo del Toros back at work Charlie Cox keeps talking Daredevil Born Again and more. Spoilers ho Ghostbusters The Animated Movie In conversation with The Wrap director Jennifer Kluska revealed Sonys animated Ghostbusters film will enjoy a unique visual and tonal style in order to explore the bigger weirder stage of both the supernatural and the telling of ghost stories. It feels sort of very right and fitting to come back to Ghostbustersin an animated form. It feels like so many Ghostbustersfans come from that space as well. And that gives you this bigger weirder stage to play upon. And I think we want to obviously do something very new and different as we always do but we know that there are so many Ghostbustersfans who just are waiting to see this franchise animated again. By design this is going to be different. I think all of the films that Sony does are very consciously stylistically and tonally different and more and more also visually. The technology and the artistry pushes the medium and we are going to be looking for our own approach thats going to be a very specific link to the Ghostbustersfranchise to the world of supernatural and to the telling of ghost stories.

The two new cards coming to Marvel Snap this week are Darkhawk and Sentry. Darkhawk is a superhero who first emerged in the 1990s and has a technoorganic body with glider wings. In Marvel Snap hes a 4Cost 1Power Ongoing card that gives 2 Power for each card in the deck of your opponent. Meanwhile Sentry is a hero that was introduced in 2000 that has Supermanlike abilities but is connected to an evil entity called the Void thats just as powerful. Ingame that translates to Sentry being a 4Cost On Reveal card with 8Power that cant be played at the right location as playing Sentry will cast a 8 power Void card there. We dont know if Sentry and Darkhawk are Series 3 Series 4 or Series 5 cards yet. It will take some time for Marvel Snaps meta to evolve and really prove whether or not Darkhawk and Sentry are all that useful but they do both have interesting abilities. Regardless keep an eye out for them in Collectors Reserves and in the Token Shop. Theyre not the only part of the Winterverse event though. From December 20 until January 2 Second Dinner is giving away ingame awards for logging in each day. These range from 100 credits to a special Nick Fury card variant featuring Samuel L. Jacksons signature. Five new winterthemed card variants will also start to show up in the shop and Collectors Reserves. You can now find Winterverse cards for Abomination Ebony Maw Patriot Rockslide and Rogue.

Instead progress is largely gated behind upgrading the quality and art of your existing collection while it takes a cosmetics driven approach to monetization. While the game was released just about two months ago its already cleared 10 million in revenue globally a major feat for a game in a less widely played genre. By comparison fans can agree that Diablo Immortal is fun to play but its paytowin monetization was controversial to say the least. By one YouTubers math it could take upwards of 100000 to have a fully upgraded character. Despite this controversy the game earned over 100 million in about two months. Only Pokmon Go has reached 9figures of revenue faster. By the end of 2022 it was the third highest grossing mobile game of the year. Marvel Snap has cultivated a community that could make it a forever franchise with the revenue to match. Meanwhile Diablo Immortal has optimized spending. If Marvel Snap can turn the corner it could be deeply influential across the industry. If not Im expecting more games to borrow from Diablo Immortal or Genshin Impacts playbook. Sorare blockchain gaming in 2023 Blockchain gaming and playtoearn titles attracted millions of players and billions in investment over the last couple of years. However the crypto winter of 2022 hit the market hard. In 2023 blockchain games will need to prove that they have staying power and the potential for mass adoption. Enter Sorare a sports game where players can buy sell and trade digital player card NFTs to build a fantasy team. The French development team chose to start with soccer and recently added NBA and MLB support. While the title isnt new per se in 2022 it hit its stride postcrypto winter. Sorare will draw comparisons to NBA Top Shot but it has definitely iterated on the sports NFT collectible model. Sorare appeals to more fans has a better onramp for new users and the added gameplay will give the title more staying power. Perhaps more importantly the game has also defied the block chain gaming boomandbust cycle. Sorare has steadily built in popularity over time. Today Sorare is searched for far more often than NBA Top Shot. Will this quieter more sustainable strategy work The industry will get more answers next year. Wordle Games for nongaming subscriptions Wordle might not be the flashiest or most complicated game but its success is undeniable. The game peaked in popularity early in the year but it has maintained healthy interest among its broad audience. In fact Wordle was 2022s most searched on Google. term One of the reasons Wordle spread so far was its builtin sharing feature. With a simple copy and paste users could compare results without spoilers and get people to seek out where all those emoji block grids were coming from. In January the New York Times bought the game from its developer for a price in the low seven figures. The papers reporting on the purchase emphasizes how important games are to accomplishing the papers goal of 10 million subscribers by the end of 2025. In an era where engagement and attention means everything for businesses its becoming more obvious that games can drive this repeat engagement for other subscription services. Netflixs foray into gaming is the other obvious example. If businesses are looking to keep users subscribed especially if discretionary spending is down I expect more will follow the NY Times lead and turn to gaming to retain users in 2023. High on Life AI and the Netflix effect High on Life is a blend of comedy Metroidvaniastyle exploration and FPS combat. While the game was one of 2022s final releases it has left a lasting impact quickly. On the more controversial side Justin Roiland cofounder and CEO of Squanch Games and cocreator of Rick and Morty confirmed High on Life used AI tools in production. The team used Midjourney AI to create alienesque paintings as finishing touches for the games otherworldly setting. AI was also used to prototype some voiceovers with one minor AIvoiced role making the final cut. I dont know what the future holds but AI is going to be a tool that has the potential to make content creation incredibly accessible Roiland said in an interview with Sky News. In 2023 the gaming industry will probably see more titles following High on Lifes lead. Additionally High on Life is now the most successful poster child for Xboxs Game Pass. The title was the biggest release on the service in 2022. Perhaps more critically High on Life is the biggest third party launch in Game Pass history and the biggest singleplayer game launch on Game Pass too. High on Lifes massively successful launch on the service helps prove out Microsofts intended business model works for more than AAA multiplayer games. Like Netflix Game Pass has shown that it can introduce a growing number of players to new games simply because they are included in the monthly subscription fee. Likely more AA and smaller studios will look to High on Lifes success as a marketing strategy for their own titles. BGMI Call of Duty and Fortnite Governments and Games In 2022 governments around the world took note of the power and influence of gaming. The earliest steps towards this such as China limiting video game approvals and playtime for minors took place years ago. However this spotlight on the industry came into full effect this year. India has taken major steps to crack down on one of the countrys most popular titles Battlegrounds Mobile India. PUBG Mobile was banned alongside several other apps published by Chinese companies. Later Krafton released the countryspecific version in 2021 to address these data privacy concerns. This year BGMI was banned again for the same national security concerns. With growing bipartisan support for a TikTok ban in the U. S. we could see bans spread. The U. S. is also looking more closely at regulating the gaming industry. With Microsofts 69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard on the line the Federal Trade Commission among other regulators is taking a close look at consolidation in the industry. This deal has also left Call of Duty as the proverbial baby that Microsoft and Sony want to split. The FTC is showing muscle in other ways. Just last week the FTC issued a 520 million fine to Epic Games for child privacy violations and deceptive business practices. This fine was the largest in history for the commission. Additionally the European Union is also looking at regulations and investments in games and esports. Part of the EUs motivation for this was to contribute to EU soft power and promote European values. More broadly the governing body is setting itself up as the global tech industry regulator. This could have major impacts on hardware app stores and more. The industry must grapple with games being used as political tools. Whether its data privacy and national security concerns regulations or investment the relationships between gaming companies and governments are changing. Rulings on the Microsoft and Activision Blizzard deal are expected in early 2023 but gaming companies must consider how additional regulations and oversight could affect future plans.

Marvel Snap Smartphones PC Lightningquick matches collectible superheroes and enticing simplicity make this the smartphone card game of dreams. Free of convoluted rules and sprawling decks this is cardbattling boiled down to the elegant essentials. Evocative comicbook art betrays a genuine love for the Marvel source material too. What we said A wonderful combination of nostalgia fun and challenge. If the seemingly unstoppable Marvelisation of popular culture must continue let it at least occasionally throw up gems like this. 19. A Little to the Left PC Mac A puzzle game that draws upon the human talent for pattern recognition to turn us all into neatfreaks rearranging books and cutlery and stationery by size colour shape or whatever else feels right. So satisfying that it frequently elicits a sigh of happiness when a puzzle is complete and everything is as it should be. What we said The impression is of a project made with great care and love. 18. Return to Monkey Island PC Nintendo Switch Sometimes when a beloved thing from the past comes roaring back again you rather wish it had stayed safely coddled in your memory. But happily Return to Monkey Island is full of old friends were delighted to see again. Full of piratical pointandclick puzzles affectionate writing and voice acting that raises a smile. What we said A tale that retreads old paths but also clearly wants to be more than just an ode to a bygone era. 17. OlliOlli World PC PlayStation 45 Switch Xbox Chill vibes only in this charming welcoming skating game where having a good time and expressing yourself feel just as important as stringing tricks together for high scores. Its snappy and delightful to play amusing to look at and excellent fun capturing the irreverence and charm of modern skate culture. What we said From its freespirited counterculture flavour to its flamboyant aesthetic this is the gaming equivalent of a weekend trip to Brighton. 16. Horizon Forbidden West PlayStation 45 It would have been difficult to even imagine a game as vast as this a decade ago. Flamehaired robotdinosaur hunter Aloys seemingly unending quest to fix the mistakes of her planets architects is so huge that you can get lost in it sometimes but its a stunning feat nonetheless exciting to play and aweinspiring to look at. What we said A damn good time and a stunning example of just how good video games can look in 2022. 15. Pentiment PC Xbox Historical games tend to tell grand heroic stories but not Pentiment here you are a manuscript illustrator in a small Bavarian town that is about to be convulsed by the Reformation. Its a tale told with empathy about the ordinary lives of people living through a time of immense change. What we said A game that provides a wonderfully evocative window into the past. 14. Neon White Nintendo Switch PC Described as a game for freaks by its designer this parkourshootermeetsanimecardgame speedrunner defies categorisation and is more interesting for it. Its levels are elegantly designed for you to shave milliseconds off your times with each run creating nearendless potential for selfimprovement. Its cast meanwhile is a bunch of cringeworthy posturing nerds that you cant look away from. What we said Neon Whites chaotic presentation and somewhat puerile script conceals a game of taut design and striking imagination. 13. Splatoon 3 Nintendo Switch Nintendos colourful family inksplattering shooter might not be bringing anything that new to the table but its just SUCH fun and so inimitably stylish. A quietly innovative singleplayer adventure brings a creative intellectual challenge alongside the usual turf wars and chaotic shootouts. What we said Ive been playing versions of this game on and off for seven years now but the fun doesnt wear off. 12. Total War Warhammer III PC The finale of a grand operatic fantasy war trilogy this hugescale highstakes strategy game sees eight factions of gloriously overwrought daemons dwarfs undead and ogres fight epic battles and sieges to build and secure their empires and lay claim to supernatural demonic power of course. An absurdly generous sandbox for Warhammer fans to play in. What we said Warhammers real trick has always been how it stays tongueincheek about its own excess while still worldbuilding with earnest imagination and Creative Assembly caps off the trilogy with some of its most gripping and funniest writing. 11. Nintendo Switch Sports Nintendo Switch Its not complicated but swinging a controller around to play tennis or fling a bowling ball or kick a giant football is always always fun. Nintendo Switch Sports is a game that welcomes allcomers from competitive kids to nervous dabblers. Recaptures all that was great about the glory days of the Nintendo Wii. What we said None of these sports would be enough to sustain a game alone but together and paired with Nintendos charming slick aesthetic and braininfesting music they are the makings of a good time. 10. Bayonetta 3 Nintendo Switch If you fed the weirder bits of the Book of Revelation and a bunch of action anime series to an AI youd probably come out with something like Bayonetta 3. The hypersexual demonandGodslaying witch takes us on a truly wild ride resulting in one of the most outthere exhibitionist gaming spectacles youll ever play. What we said Bayonetta 3 is a reverent hymn to video games in all their glorious silliness. 9. The Case of the Golden Idol PC Irresistible to fans of detective fiction this intelligent elaborate mystery game revolves around a cursed treasure and has you examining ornate crime scenes frozen in time at the moment of every different victims death. It lets you piece together every last thing yourself and makes you feel very clever for doing so. What we said A game of wondrous Sherlockian texture that plays out in our own imagination as much as on screen. 8. Cult of the Lamb PC PlayStation 45 Xbox Nintendo Switch A twisted kawaii art style and unbelievably compelling gameplay loop made this weird game about a sacrificed sheep one of the surprise hits of the year. Above ground build your following and look after your cultists below ground battle demons in an effort to free an eldritch God. What we said The overall effect is darkly fascinatingly cute mallgoth meets folk horror and the perfect set dressing for elegant sharp gameplay. 7. Tunic PC Xbox Remember the days when video games secrets were hardwon knowledge gleaned from painstakingly studying paper manuals and trading stories in the playground Tunic does. It yearns for and recreates a time when games felt unknowable and enticing before video walkthroughs and social media spoilers. A wonderful nostalgic but innovative adventure that feels like a step into the unknown. What we said It feels like a luxury to play a game that isnt constantly prodding you towards the next objective and that instead allows you the space to daydream. 6. Norco PC Xbox PlayStation A magicalrealist lament about a reallife small town in Louisiana thats been swallowed by the oil industry this downbeat narrative game is about what its protagonist leaves behind when she abandons her home town and what is and isnt worth coming back to and trying to salvage. What we said This is no gleaming scifi landscape its humid and buzzing a place of poverty its people braced for the next economic or natural disaster. 5. God of War Ragnark PlayStation 45 Retired Spartan Godkiller Kratos and his increasingly wayward son Atreus just cant extricate themselves from the lives of the NorseGods in this astonishingly ambitious mythological adventure. The physicality of the weapons and fists makes fighting mythic beasts thrilling but its once again the story and characters that make this epic worth seeing through. What we said There havent been many interpretations of ancient mythology as gripping detailed and imaginative as this in video games or any other medium. 4. Stray PC PlayStation 45 It could have just been The Cat Game but Stray is a memorable work of science fiction that shows how seeing a game world from a different perspective can make you think differently too. As a cat you explore robot shantytowns with graceful leaps and batting paws. Halfopen windows become opportunities objects balanced perilously close to a ledge become irresistible temptations. What we said By placing this magnetic yet unknowable creature of nature into a tightly controlled humanmade sciencefiction dystopia Stray highlights something that any cat person already knows you can never really tame a cat. 3. Immortality PC Xbox smartphones A spellbinding game that is also three entire movies Immortality is something that has never been even conceived of before either in games or film. Unravelling the mystery of a vanished Hollywood starlet by examining footage from her works we become absorbed into this fastidiously recreated cinematic universe and become part of the story ourselves. What we said I have never seen or played anything like it. Its not a game that everyone will love but I do think its one that everyone should play. 2. Elden Ring PC PlayStation 45 Xbox Building upon the principles of developer FromSoftwares previous cult hit games challenge selfdirection perseverance mastery discovery Elden Ring creates an exquisitely absorbing fantasy. Everywhere you go there is something alluring or something that can kill you or both. Exploring and slowly conquering this masterwork feels like a true achievement. What we said This is a massive world astonishingly rendered the sun and moon wheel in the sky casting each scene anew and seemingly limitless in its creative diversity. It is an unrivalled feat of design and inventiveness. 1. Wordle Available online Few games have ever united the world like Wordle the beautifully simple daily word puzzle that exemplifies a universal truth about video games they bring people together and its our shared experiences with them that we remember most fondly. Seeing friends and family whod never normally engage with games swapping strats and chasing streaks was a rare joy after the relentless pummelling of the past few years. It first released in 2021 taking off in popularity just before the new year but Wordle is nonetheless the feelgood story of 2022. It felt like a gift to the world a small dose of daily happiness easily spread. What we said The game has the elegance of a daily newspaper puzzle a fiveminute conundrum that slots pleasingly into even the most harried routine.,2022-12-21T15:00:08Z,How 2022’s most influential games will change gaming in 2023,Extremely Positive,360,"crashed, controversial, controversy, hard, complicated, controversial, concerns, concerns, split, deceptive, concerns, oversight",crack,"lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit, Justin, Roiland, Roiland, lawsuit, lawsuit, harassment",theguardian
59,Treason review – say hello to TV’s cuddliest spy,"Gripping as this fun, frenetic espionage thriller is, its lead isn’t exactly a hard nut. Think cheerful lectures to schoolkids and channelling the personality of a lovely labrador …Although just about every actor on the face of the Earth has enjoyed a stint a…",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/dec/26/treason-review-netflix-charlie-cox-spy-show,Although just about every actor on the face of the Earth has enjoyed a stint as the frontrunner to play the next Bond Charlie Cox seems to be the sole exception. Despite sharing an age a gender and a race with every screen Bond so far not to mention a handy sideline as a superhero given that he plays Daredevil in the Marvel cinematic universe for some reason he hasnt quite made the cut. The reason it seems is Treason Netflix. A big part of the Potential 007 audition sequence is to play someone slightly Bondy on the small screen as Tom Hiddleston did with The Night Manager and James Norton did with McMafia. Its an opportunity for them to dress the part brood in a variety of opulent locations and occasionally mess around with guns. Treason a spy thriller written by the Oscarnominated cowriter of Bridge of Spies sounds as if it should have been cut from the exact same cloth. And yet our first meaningful introduction to Coxs spy comes during a scene in a school library where he cheerfully tells a bunch of primaryage kids what its like to be a spy. Which however you cut it isnt something you can imagine Daniel Craig doing. Indeed throughout the course of Treason Cox is less an international man of mystery and more a lovely labrador who has somehow gained the skill to operate a humanoid robot. But Cox is no mere spy. Despite looking like a particularly meek supply teacher he is in fact second in command at MI6. And when his boss Ciarn Hinds thankfully given slightly more to do than he was in The English is incapacitated during an errant whiskypoisoning accident it falls to Cox to run the ship. This is plainly ridiculous since the man looks like his natural calling is to host a CBeebies series about the importance of cuddles but lets go with it. It is extremely difficult to mention anything specific about the plot from this point onwards because that would unravel the entire series but it is safe to say that things dont go well. Hindss poisoner is Olga Kurylenko who has a past with Cox and things get knottier and knottier until his whole family ends up involved in the mess. I can tell you that the plot involves a full English of contemporary references kompromat shady Russian lords a Conservative leadership campaign and that the show is set in London because this is one of those shows where scenes dont count unless there is an immediately recognisable central London landmark in the middle of the screen. Any more than that would destroy the ride. Its a pretty good ride too. Treason manages that brilliant television trick of sucking you in with its labyrinthine plot so effectively that you dont realise quite how stupid it is until long after the credits roll at which point it hits you like a ton of bricks. But still it has the air of unfulfilled promise. Its weird in this age of Far Too Much Television to wish that a show went on for longer but this is the case with Treason. Its a fivepart fairly finite limited series but it feels as if it was set up to be something far more substantial. What it feels like in fact is one of those big oldfashioned American network shows that ran for half a year at a time. One of those pacy inexplicable spy thrillers like 24 or Homeland that never managed to run out of complicated conspiracies that went all... the way to the top. I dare say I would have enjoyed Treason a lot more if this had been the case. Instead with less than four hours total running time Treason hits all of its requisite beats in nothing less than a blind panic. Someone gets abducted but then theyre found before anyone has the chance to start worrying. Theres a government mole but thats all sorted out with the wave of a hand. If anyone seems in any way suspicious or mysterious their true motives are usually explained within a scene or two so that the show doesnt have to drop its mad clatter to the finish line. Its fun but frustrating. A few more episodes spent with Labrador Bond and all his stupid problems and Treason could have been a belter.,2022-12-26T06:00:23Z,The 20 best video games of 2022,Extremely Positive,720,"convoluted, betrays, Chill, Forbidden, difficult, mistakes, lost, freaks, posturing, chaotic, taut, chaotic, demonic, absurdly, trick, complicated, nervous, fiction, mystery, cursed, frozen, twisted, unbelievably, weird, sacrificed, unknown, lament, downbeat, humid, buzzing, disaster, wayward, fiction, perilously, mystery, fastidiously, relentless, harried","damn, Whites, fight, crime, death, poverty, kill","Aloys, Godkiller, Kratos, Atreus, Elden, Ring",theguardian

The pandemic era looks to be in the rear view mirror crypto crashed and new business practices like subscriptions are maturing. With that in mind lets take a look at some of the titles that will have the most influence on gaming in 2023 and beyond. Marvel Snap Diablo Immortal mobile monetization 2022 gave us a small glimpse into the future of gaming monetization in 2023 particularly on mobile. Both Marvel Snap and Diablo Immortal released this year with completely opposite monetization strategies. Marvel Snap positioned itself as a consumerfriendly digital card game. Unlike competitors cards are not locked behind opening packs. Instead progress is largely gated behind upgrading the quality and art of your existing collection while it takes a cosmetics driven approach to monetization.

If Marvel Snap can turn the corner it could be deeply influential across the industry. If not Im expecting more games to borrow from Diablo Immortal or Genshin Impacts playbook. Sorare blockchain gaming in 2023 Blockchain gaming and playtoearn titles attracted millions of players and billions in investment over the last couple of years. However the crypto winter of 2022 hit the market hard. In 2023 blockchain games will need to prove that they have staying power and the potential for mass adoption. Enter Sorare a sports game where players can buy sell and trade digital player card NFTs to build a fantasy team.

We can confirm Jeremy is in critical but stable condition with injuries suffered after experiencing a weatherrelated accident while plowing snow earlier today a spokesperson for the Hawkeye star told the Hollywood Reporter late on Sunday night. His family is with him and he is receiving excellent care they added. Deadline reported that Renner was airlifted to hospital. TMZ reported eyewitness accounts that said Renner was plowing the road about a quarter mile from his home in Reno Nevada so his family could get out after a snowstorm. A neighbour said that despite its safety features the SnoCat plow ran over one of the actors legs. He was said to have been losing a lot of blood from the injury and another neighbour who is a doctor put a tourniquet on his leg until paramedics arrived. TMZ added that police arrived at the scene at 8pm to impound the SnoCat. Local officials said the actor suffered a traumatic injury on Sunday morning and was transported to a local area hospital in a care flight. The Washoe County Sheriffs Office said in a statement that it responded to a traumatic injury in the area of Mt Rose Highway in Reno Nevada on Sunday morning at 9am. It said Renner was the only involved party in the incident which was being investigated. The 51yearold actor has been nominated for two Academy Awards during his acting career for his performances in The Hurt Locker and The Town. He has become wellknown for his portrayal of the superhero Clint Barton also known as Hawkeye in Marvel films and for his role in the Mission Impossible film franchise. Renner owns a ranch above Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The region was hit by a winter storm on New Years Eve that saw 35000 homes lose power. Much of the US has been hit by the blizzard of the century over the past week with at least 60 people having died countrywide. Over the weekend officials warned those who had travel plans through the Sierra Nevada of icy roads and winter weather driving conditions. On 13 December Renner shared a photo of snow in the area on Twitter writing Lake Tahoe snowfall is no joke. On Instagram he posted several clips of himself behind the wheel of a snow plow writing on one Nearly done with sledding hill for the kids. Renner is next set to appear in the second season of Mayor of Kingstown a Paramount crime drama which is due to begin airing in two weeks.,2023-01-02T04:28:10Z,"Last-minute gift cards: Disney Plus, Netflix, and more streaming stars are perfect for movie fans",Extremely Positive,30,"frustrating, stuck, worry, problem",-,Brendan,theguardian

Sharing a picture of his bruised face on Instagram Renner said he was too messed up now to type. The Avengers star was airlifted to hospital on Sunday after the accident outside his home in Reno Nevada. Renner was run over by his own snow plough which weighs at least 14330lb 6. 5 tonnes three times as heavy as a car the local sheriff said. He suffered blunt chest trauma and orthopaedic injuries his publicist said on Monday. At that time he was in a stable but critical condition in intensive care. In an Instagram post from his hospital bed on Tuesday evening Renner 51 wrote Thank you all for your kind words. Im too messed up now to type. But I send love to you all. The incident happened after a new year storm left around 3ft of fresh snowfall on the ground Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said in a press conference. A family member driving Renners car had got stuck in the snow near his house the sheriff said. Using his snow plough Renner successfully towed the car free.

The average weight of a car according to the US Environmental Protection Agency is 4289lb 2 tonnes. An eyewitness detailed seeing Mr Renner getting into the PistenBully and not seeing him again until the PistenBully came to a rest in a pile of snow in front of his driveway Mr Balaam said.

New temporarily common locations are a clever way of mixing things up imposing restraints or possibilities depending on how much you tinker with your decks. The latest location Vormir is a bit borked. I just spent a minute or so swapping emotes with someone while the game tried to load our unrelated animations which might not sound like much but constitutes a good third of a matchs normal running time. Im not the only one running into lag problems. Reddit is rife with people reporting issues and it seems everyone at Kotaku is having trouble too. Ive got no problems with the location itself. If my deck doesnt cough up cards Ive specifically included so theyll get munched there it presents an interesting decision over whether to throw an early low cost card into its jaws or regret not doing that later. I do hope developers Second Dinner dont run out of steam with good new location ideas. Earlier today in a blessedly Vormirfree match I screwed someone over by constantly playing Moon Knight in a cloning facility knowing that my deck was built to benefit from the way he discards a card from both players hands while my opponent would be left with next to nothing. Its a good example of how locations combine with brevity to allow for shenanigans that would suck to play against too much of the time in other games but work great as special treats. That said the location that fills your deck with rocks is awful and I hate it. You can download Marvel Snap for free on Steam though you might have a better time if you wait until Friday when Vormir stops being the featured location.,2022-12-21T22:42:18Z,Jeremy Renner: Avengers star thanks fans after being run over by snow plough,Somewhat Positive,180,"bruised, messed, suffered, blunt, trauma, critical, messed, stuck, Hurt","killed, killed","Jeremy, Renner, Jeremy, Renner, Renner, Renner, Renner, Darin, Balaam, Renners, Renner, Renner, Balaam, Renner, Balaam, Renner, Renners, Renners, Chris, Evans, Tough, as, nails, Chris, Pratt, brutha, Paul, Bettany, Vanessa, Hudgens, Heidi, Klum, Orlando, Bloom, Jimmy, Fallon, Renner, Chris, Hemsworth, Speedy, Taika, Waititi, Ken, Block, Renner, Clint, BartonHawkeye",rockpapershotgun
66,Dwayne Johnson updates 'Black Adam's' uncertain future in the DC Universe,"""Black Adam"" possesses almost unlimited power, but apparently not enough to secure a sequel to the movie, at least anytime soon.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/entertainment/dwayne-johnson-black-adam-sequel/index.html,Black Adam possesses almost unlimited power but apparently not enough to secure a sequel to the movie at least anytime soon. After speculation that DC wouldnt proceed with a second film star and producer Dwayne The Rock Johnson took to Twitter on Tuesday to update fans saying that he had met with DC Studios new leadership team James Gunn and Peter Safran. While he didnt close the door on Black Adam returning in some form Johnson said the character was not in DCs plans for the immediate future. DC Studios and CNN are both part of Warner Bros. Discovery. The announcement comes on the heels of several decisions by DCs management team that have angered some fans particularly those involving the flagship characters Superman and Wonder Woman. My passionate friends I wanted to give you a longawaited Black Adam update regarding the characters future in the new DC Universe. James Gunn and I connected and Black Adam will not be in their first chapter of storytelling. However DC and Seven Bucks have agreed to continue exploring the most valuable ways Black Adam can be utilized in future DC multiverse chapters Johnson wrote. James and I have known each other for years and have always rooted for each other to succeed. He went on to write Its no different now and I will always root for DC and Marvel to win and WIN BIG. You guys know me and I have very thick skin and you can always count on me to be direct with my words. These decisions made by James and DC leadership represent their vision of DCU through their creative lens. Johnson added that he was very proud to make the film which made its debut in October. Black Adam stars Johnson as the title character spun out of the same comics that spawned the Shazam franchise. In the movie the antihero is awakened in the present day after being dormant for years and proceeds to fight the Justice Society of America including such heroes as Hawkman and Doctor Fate. Although the movie has grossed nearly 400 million worldwide there has been some debate about whether that will be enough to make the film profitable given its high budget and marketing costs. Johnson has stated via Twitter that it ultimately will be. The film was coolly received by critics averaging just a 41 out of 100 on the aggregation site Metacritic. Black Adam ended with a closingcredit sequence that hinted at further adventures to come including a cameo by Henry Cavill in the role of Superman. But it has since been revealed that Cavill will not be part of the franchise going forward. Gunn who directed The Suicide Squad and its streaming spinoff Peacemaker took to Twitter on Monday to address the outcry from some fans over planned changes in the DC Universe. Those fans took issue with the announcement that a new Superman movie is in the works without Cavill and also that Wonder Woman 3 has been put on hold with new management having rejected the treatment for the film submitted by director Patty Jenkins. Gunn said choices for the DC Universe will be based upon what we believe is best for the story. CNN has reached out to DC Studios for comment but Gunn responded publicly to Johnsons post on Twitter saying in regard to Johnson and his company Cant wait to collaborate soon.,2022-12-20T22:53:49Z,"

67,"Disney should spin off ESPN and ABC, analyst says","Disney, like most media companies, had a rough year. But one Wall Street analyst has an idea for how Disney could get back on track.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/investing/disney-espn-abc-spinoff/index.html,Disney like most media companies had a rough year. But one Wall Street analyst has an idea for how Disney could get back on track. Wells Fargos Steven Cahall thinks Disney should spin off cable sports giant ESPN and traditional TV network ABC two slowgrowth and some would argue dying businesses. Disney could then focus more on its namesake studio and theme parks Marvel Pixar and Star Wars producer Lucasfilm as well as the TV and movie franchises of Fox that it bought in 2019. Spinning ESPNABC is the best path forward and we see it as a reasonably probable late23 event Cahall wrote adding that splitting off ESPN and ABC from Disney would mean that the remainder of the company would be an attractive pure play intellectual property company. Its not a new idea Daniel Loeb who runs the activist hedge fund Third Point said in August that he wanted Disney to spin off ESPN. But its clear that Disney may need to do something to appease jittery investors. The House of Mouse is losing money on Disney and Hulu as competition mounts and inflationweary consumers grow increasingly tired of paying more money for streaming services. Shares of Disney DIS have plunged nearly 45 this year making it the third worst performer in the Dow in 2022. Only Salesforce CRM and Intel INTC have posted bigger drops. The stunning slide for Disney is one reason why CEO Bob Chapek was forced out in November and replaced by former CEO Bob Iger. There has been a lot of speculation about what Iger will do to return the media giant to its former glory. Cahall wrote in his report that we think Bob Iger is returning to Disney ready to make big changes. In the near term we think the CEO and his key reports are focused on content and cost rationalization. However over the longerterm we expect a deeper think on portfolio reshaping. Disney better off without sports ESPN in theory may have an easier time negotiating with sports leagues as part of a pure play media network. It also may make it easier for the company to try and get into the lucrative world of gambling which may not be as easy a sell for a more familyfriendly Disney. Cahall also said that spinning off ABC along with ESPN makes sense because the two of them combined are an even bigger powerhouse in sports media. We think ESPN and ABC are integrally linked as the broadcast network improves negotiations in sports rights and were seeing more of those sports on both networks he wrote. Disney had no comment when asked by CNN about Cahalls report. But ESPN recently touted its 2022 performance in a press release this week saying that ESPN continued to build a strategic path forward while connecting with audiences in innovative ways. ESPN added that throughout the year ESPN successfully reached sports fans in record numbers. Not the first time In a letter to thenCEO Chapek in August Loeb wrote a strong case can be made that the ESPN business should be spun off to shareholders with an appropriate debt load to reduce Disneys overall debt. Loeb didnt discuss ABC in his letter. But Loeb noted that ESPN would be better off free from Disney because ESPN would have greater flexibility to pursue business initiatives that may be more difficult as part of Disney such as sports betting and added that customers of ESPN and sports leagues would be better served by a focused management team. Loeb quickly changed his mind though. Just one month after his letter to Chapek Loeb wrote in a tweet that we have a better understanding of ESPNs potential as a standalone business and another vertical for Disney to reach a global audience to generate ad and subscriber revenues.,2022-12-20T20:05:40Z,"

Prior to the movies the most iconic media associated with SpiderMan was the classic theme song from the 60s cartoon. In fact SpiderMan has flourished in the world of animation since that series debuted in the 60s. In the 80s SpiderMan joined forces with Iceman and Firestar for a new generation in SpiderMan and his Amazing Friends. And while both shows were memorable many modern fans of SpiderMan cite the 90s version of the Wall Crawlers animated adventures as the cream of the crop. Well those fans are wrong. The best SpiderMan cartoon is the Spectacular SpiderMan from the 2010s and it isnt even close. Despite being beloved by SpiderMan fans Spectacular SpiderMan was unceremoniously canceled when Marvel consolidated all of its animated projects on Disney. For years fans have rallied behind the series hoping to will another season into existence. Now thanks to the upcoming SpiderMan Across the SpiderVerse Spectacular SpiderMan lives again. On Tuesday Sony Pictures released a new poster for SpiderMan Across the SpiderVersethat finally revealed a fanfavorite 90s SpiderMans inclusion in the animated film. The international version of that poster features some additional SpiderMans not seen on the domestic poster including another fanfavorite the SpiderMan from the Spectacular SpiderMananimated series which recently became available to stream and is considered by many to be the bestanimated adaptation of Marvels webslinger. Writerproducer Phil Lord confirmed on Twitter that the SpiderMan in the bottomright corner of the poster is indeed the one from Spectacular SpiderMan. The poster also features Spinneret a version of Mary Jane Watson who gains spider powers and along with Peter Parker and their daughter fights crime together as a family. This is a different Mary Jane Watson than the one who is getting superpowers in the Marvel comics currently. Theres also a version of Flash Thompson as SpiderMan.,2022-12-22T14:47:39Z,"

Created with the help of MidJourneys AI these Marvel X Nike football sneakers capture the grandeur of some of the MCUs most memorable heroes and antiheroes. Treading a fine line between being sporty footwear and an homage to a comicbook character these football boots look exceptional on their own even when observed without context. The series spans 9 different footwear models dedicated to distinct characters from the Avengers movie and Wolverine. Scroll down to see which one is your favorite Designer Paul Parsons The SpiderMan sneaker obviously uses the traditional color palette with a liberal application of randomized lines to represent the friendly neighborhood webslingers webbing. Notice how none of the sneakers actually use logos of the Marvel heroes so as to avoid any copyright infringement I suppose but do wonderfully integrate Nikes tick sign into the shoes to give them their unique character. I assume Nikes much more liberal with fanmade concepts than Disney. Iron Man and Black Panther tie in second place just because I have so much love for the characters in general. The formers shoe has a lean design but with more chunky 3D elements that give it an exoskeletonlike appeal coupled with that signature metallic red and gold interplay that we love so much. The Black Panther shoe on the other hand relies on a more Afrofuturisticleaning design thats heavy on textures and lines much like TChalla and Shuris suits. The use of gold makes me guess these are for the new Black Panther in our lives. Loki and Thor are arguably the most difficult to replicate. Given that its difficult to add any signature motifs like horns or hammers on the shoes everything boils down to color themes and the use of thunder in the latters artwork. I really have a newfound appreciation for the green and gold combo which Parsons football sneaker concept utilizes beautifully. The golden studs near the heel and the golden tick mark really make the shoe stand out. With Thor Id much rather see the use of the square chainmail that was found in Thors sleeves in earlier movies. The shoe uses a white and red interplay with lightning streaks to invoke the Norse God of thunder. Hulks footwear treatment seems more on the side of realism given that the proportions are still very human. A creative call on the designers part I still quite like this one. Theres a bit of an acidic toxic aesthetic here that feels more akin to The Lizard here but still a job well done The creases and lines on the shoe somewhat feel like sinews and muscles without the exaggerated proportions of The Hulk. Maybe a little purple would do the trick as is found in the heros tattered but holdingtogether pants. Wolverine seemed like a bit of a wild card here but Ive always loved what Hugh Jackman brought to the role. Hes more Wolverine than Robert is Iron Man if you ask me and I know thats a controversial hot take. Again this concept stays on the lines of realism by not including any razorsharp adamantium studs at the bottom of the footwear but that yellow and black aesthetic is just instantly recognizable. It uses stripes that can be found in the original costume too with a sharp tick mark cutting through for extra impact. We bring our collection to its conclusion with Groot and Thanos. The two nonhuman sources of inspiration in this collection. The Groot footwear grootwear has a wonderfully woody appeal with roots and twigs curling around each other the way they do on the woody superheros body. The shoe rests on a carpet of leaves too completely honoring the theme. With Thanos however the shoes design misses the inclusion of the Infinity Stones but theres the signature purple and golden melange that is synonymous with the characters purple skin and golden gauntlet. Lines around the shoes chin resemble the creases found on Thanos chin too,2023-01-09T23:30:37Z,Spectacular Spider-Man will cameo in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,Extremely Positive,50,wrong,crime,"SpiderMans, Phil, Lord, SpiderMan, Spinneret, Mary, Jane, Watson, Peter, Parker, Mary, Jane, Watson, Flash, Thompson, SpiderMan",yankodesign

In a short post to Instagram where he shared a selfie reflecting some facial bruising Renner wrote Thank you all for your kind words. Im sic too messed up now to type. But I send love to you all. Earlier on Tuesday Samantha Mast Renners publicist provided more details on the accident that landed Renner in the hospital saying the actor was near his Nevada home clearing driveways prior to the incident. Renner was moving snow from his driveway on Sunday so that his family members could depart his residence after they celebrated the holidays together his representative added. Members of Renners family were with him when the accident occurred. Jeremy is making positive progress and is awake talking and in good spirits Mast said a new statement released Tuesday evening. He remains in ICU in critical but stable condition. He is overwhelmed by the showing of love and support. The family asks for your continued thoughts while he heals with his close loved ones. A TRAGIC ACCIDENT Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said on Tuesday during a press conference that Renner was run over by his snowcat a device to remove snow after the machine started to roll away when he was not in the drivers seat. He was injured during an attempt to get back into the snowcat Balaam said. Balaam added that authorities do not believe Renner was intoxicated during the incident and called it a tragic accident. A spokesperson for Renner previously told CNN that he sustained blunt chest trauma and orthopedic injuries. The 51yearold actor has so far undergone two surgeries to address his injuries a source close to the actor told CNN. The Washoe County Sheriffs Office has said the incident occurred in the Mount Rose Highway area in Reno. Deputies found Renner injured and coordinated his transport to an area hospital the Sheriffs Office said in a news release adding that the actor was the only person involved in the accident. Balaam said on Tuesday that Renner was awake and speaking with first responders when they arrived to the scene of the incident. When Renner was injured his neighbors rendered aid and brought towels while waiting for first responders Balaam added. Washoe County Sheriffs Office is currently in possession of Renners snowcat and analyzing it to rule out any potential mechanical failure which is a normal part of the investigation with this severity of injuries Balaam said. Authorities do not suspect any foul play Balaam said. At the time of the accident parts of western Nevada were covered with snow. The Reno area received around 612 inches of snow at elevations below 5000 feet between New Years Eve and New Years Day and up to 18 inches at higher elevations according to the National Weather Service in Reno. Renner has previously shared multiple videos and photos on his verified social media accounts showing him in snowy conditions including one Instagram video posted two weeks ago in which the actor appears to be driving a snowplow.

Prior to the MCU Iron Man was the definition of a Clist superhero. Despite his status within the Marvel comics 616 universe as one of the premier Avengers the characters sales figures were minuscule compared to other heavyweights emanating from the House of ideas. Flash forward to 2022 and Iron Man has become one of the pillars of the genre. Similar to how one solid adaptation can change a characters fortune a crappy one can almost irreparably destroy their reputation. Millions of people thought Daredevil was a dumb idea for a decade thanks to the Ben Affleck film from the 2000s. Again flash forward to 2022 and the characters reputation in liveaction is equivalent to that of his comic book exploits. When HBO Max announced that they were developing a mature Green Lantern series fans of the Emerald Knight thought the character would finally get his Daredevil reinvention in liveaction. However thanks to the Warner Brothers Discovery merger the series appears to be dead in the water. A new report suggests that the Green Lanternseries originally announced for premiere on the HBO Max streaming service has been scrapped. According to scooper DanielRPK the series was cancelled for unknown reasons. However the pundit also claimed DC Studios coCEO James Gunn has plans for a film featuring Green Lantern. At the time of writing no official announcements have been made concerning the fate of the project. This follows previous reports suggesting both the showrunner Seth GrahameSmith and stars Jeremy Irvine and Finn Wittrock who were attached to play Alan Scott and Guy Gardner respectively had left the show as the project was being revamped to center on John Stewart rather than multiple members of the Green Lantern Corps.,2022-12-27T13:38:28Z,Jeremy Renner shares first photo since snow plowing accident,Somewhat Positive,2650,"bruising, messed, critical, overwhelmed, TRAGIC, tragic, blunt, trauma, severity, suspect, foul, overwhelmed, risk, recession, recession, exacerbate, vulnerable, discrimination, chill, risk, warning, freezing, cold, inappropriate, inappropriate, dead, Risk, falls, freezing, risk, recession, recession, exacerbate, vulnerable, Emergency, crisis, emergency, toll, chill, risk, warning, freezing, cold, Suspect, suspect, effigy, sabotage, protest, effigy, hung, sabotage, Rifts, rival, refuse, worried, worried, threaten, trauma, threat, threat, twist, recession, crippling, inappropriate, inappropriate, errant, forgetful, lost, offensive, flagging, mock, misleading","Fire, violence, violence, abuse, Conservative, fire, firing, firing, died, explosion, explosion, explosion, explosion, violence, violence, abuse, dies, died, death, murder, assassination, assassination, murder, fight, death, diseases, Sick, Sick, drug, gun, adult, fight, fraud, blow, firing, firing, reject","Jeremy, Renner, Jeremy, Renner, Renner, Renner, Renner, Renners, Jeremy, Darin, Balaam, Renner, Balaam, Balaam, Renner, Renner, Balaam, Renner, Renner, Balaam, Renners, Balaam, Balaam, Renner, Renners, Jeremys, Hillary, Schieve, Carano, Murdock, Renner, Hawkeye, Mark, Ruffalo, Renner, jeremyrenner, Ruffalo, Pierre, Poilievre, Pierre, Poilievre, Trudeau, Justin, Trudeau, Robbie, Bachman, Robbie, Bachman, Keenan, Anderson, Keenan, Anderson, Patrisse, Cullors, Shinzo, Abe, Shinzo, Abe, Erdogan, Ulf, Kristersson, Vladimir, Putin, Bolsonaro, Jair, Bolsonaro, Trudeau, Justin, Trudeau, Sean, Fraser, Prince, Harry, Frankie, Muniz, Malcolm, Frankie, Muniz, Meek, Mills, lawsuit, Meek, Mill, lawsuit, Tom, Wolf, Donald, Trumps, Diana, Mathesons, Schizas, Madeline, Schizas, Elon, Musks, Elon, Musk, lawsuit",-

But the looming arrival of the year 2000 was too juicy for a show that reveled in conspiracy theories to ignore and thus the aptly titled Millennium popped up in late 1999 early in the shows seventh season. As devotees of late90s television will recall Millennium was also the name of another Chris Cartercreated Fox series despite mining some of the same turf as The XFiles it failed to achieve similar popculture heights and was canceled in mid1999. Millennium the episode features a gueststarring appearance by Millennium the series lead characterLance Henriksens former FBI profiler Frank Blackwho gets some closure for his storyline as a result though it feels a bit shoehorned into whats otherwise a fairly standard monster of the week episode. As the calendar marches toward December 31 1999 a former FBI agent dies as a result of suicide which turns out to be the fourth such incident in a short amount of time. The bureau flags the cases after each mans grave is vandalized in what appears to be some kind of ritual. Grave robbing with a twist as Agent Mulder David Duchovny calls it. And though there are the usual eyerolls and papershuffling when he further elaborates on this cemetery funny business everyoneincluding the usuallyveryskeptical Agent Scully Gillian Anderson and FBI boss Skinner Mitch Pileggilets him roll with it It was necromancy the summoning of the dead. Its a form of magic dating back to primitive shamanism with a long tradition in the Christian church. Through it the dead are brought back to life for the purposes of divulging arcane knowledge and performing ritual tasks. Skinner suggests the Millennium Groupformer FBI agents turned topsecret lawenforcement consultants who as Scully said fell into disrepute after it became clear they were a doomsday cultis involved. But what exactly are they up to In search of answers Scully and Mulder head to the psychiatric hospital where Frank Black has checked in to recalibrate after his bumpy ride through Millennium. His Millennium Group entanglements led to the death of his wife during the series and when Mulder and Scully find him hes embroiled in a custody battle with his former inlaws over his young daughter. Hes so burned out he wont even look at the case file they dangle before him. With New Years Eve inching closer Scully and Mulderdoing that working separately while coming to the same conclusions thing they did so wellrealize theres indeed a doomsday plot afoot... and it involves zombies starting with the reanimated corpses of the four recently deceased FBI agentsturnedMillennium Group operatives who volunteered for this duty as part of a plan they believed would hasten the end of the world. Holmes Osborne Donnie Darko plays the loner who serves as their necromancer performing the ceremonies digging up the bodies and muttering Book of Revelation verses under his breath. All seems on schedule until hes forced to turn one of his zombies on a cop who has the misfortune to detect the human biohazard hes hauling in the back of his truck. Naturally both Mulder and Scully have their own close encounters. He was dead and then somehow he wasnt Scully groggily recounts to Skinner the rules of these creatures are a little murky but fortunately it seems this particular strain of shambling corpse wont transform attack victims unless they die as a result. They do however succumb to headshots as George A. Romero decreed. As for Frank Black he steps up when it counts providing the agents with a profile of the necromancer so incredibly accurate its not really a surprise when we realize he knows exactly who Scully and Mulder are looking for. In fact he knows exactly whats at stakethat Millennium Group manand ultimately decides hell stand for the forces of good and help prevent you know a Y2K zombie apocalypse. Fans of Millennium might have longed for another season of the show to really wrap things up but at least they got to see Frank reunite with his daughter in a moment thats sweet even without the context of three seasons of a completely different TV series. Millennium was directed by Thomas J. Wright who also helmed nearly a third of Millenniums episodes it was cowritten by Vince Gilligan who famously went on to create Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. Even sweeter though are the final seconds of the episode when Scully and Mulder watch Dick Clark on TV and share a spontaneous kiss to ring in the new year. The world didnt end they realize and whether they meant 2000 continued without an undead uprising or planet Earth kept revolving even after Scully and Mulder had a romantic liplock... well the answers a little of both perhaps.

Renfield During a recent interview with Collider Nicolas Cage confirmed his Dracula doesnt have a lot of screen time in Renfield. The movies really not about me Dracula rather I dont have a lot of screen time. Its really Nick Hoults movie and its about Renfield. I didnt have the time like the twohour narrative to really dig deep into Draculas pathos per se. Its not that. But I did have enough screen time to be able to try to develop a popart style to the character that hopefully will be a nice contribution to the other performers that have done it that have had their take on this legendary character in both literature and cinema. Evil Dead Rise In conversation with Empire Magazine director Lee Cronin stated he didnt need to set Evil Dead Rise in a city he simply wanted to. To me it felt very natural to make that move. It wasnt forced in some way of like We need Evil Deadin the city It was I want a family and I want it to be urban. I still treated it very much the same way. I view the apartment as the cabin and the hallways and the other aspects of the building as the forest.

Eventually those conversations about not using gas masks led us to these tendrils. And then just thinking about how theres a passage that happens from one infected to another and like fungus does it could become a network that is interconnected. It became very scary to think that theyre all working against us in this unified way which was a concept that I really liked that got developed in the show.

But was i…",https://gizmodo.com/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-star-trek-voyager-tsunkatse-1849938768,As 2022 ends its hard to say that Dwayne The Rock Johnson has had a more influential year in his acting career even if that influence was his longinthemaking Black Adam movie almost singlehandedly tearing apart the DC cinema slate for years. But was it his year as an actor Absolutely not because that is was and forever will be 2000. Because thats when Tsunkatse the 15th episode of Star Trek Voyagers penultimate sixth season aired marking the debut of Johnsons acting career before he would truly explode onto the scene a year later in The Mummy Returns. Born of an absurd idea for broadcaster UPN to cross over two of its biggest shows Voyager and WWF nee WWE SmackdownJohnson plays a major role in the episode as the Pendari Champion a hulking combatant in the melee bloodsport Tsunkatse that goes toetotoe with a captured Seven of Nine. Its deeply silly if only because for Star Trek fans The Rock is perhaps only the third most notable guest star Deep Space Nine legends J. G. Hertzler and Jeffrey Combs best known for playing General Martok and Weyoun among many other roles respectively on Voyagers predecessor have guest turns too. Hertzler plays a fellow combatant in the ring of this wildly popular deathmatch a Hirogena race of Predatoresque hunters Voyager had previously encounteredwho trains the captive Seven in the arts of Tsunkatse so she can survive long enough to be rescued by the crew while Combs dazzles as Penk the slimy overlord of the Tsunkatse tournaments that captured Seven as his new ultimate warrior. But were to expect delight from Star Trek legends like these stars. The Rock for Star Trek and for the world at large beyond his turn as one of the most iconic wrestlers of his age was an untested unproven acting chameleon at this point just starting out a journey that would lead to box office dominance and well Johnson just kind of playing a heightened approximation of himself across a sea of action movies. Sometimes thats all you need and its all well and good but outside of a few specific roles its hard to particularly argue that Johnson has forged an acting career for himself that challenges him dramatically instead largely challenging him by how many stunts he can do how many tight button up shirts he can fit his giant arms into the rolled sleeves of how many times he can blur the line between the character hes meant to be playing and the persona of the Rock in the audiences head. The Pendari Champion is the predecessor to what Johnsons career would become literally and and spiritually because they are literally just the Rock with some Star Trek alien forehead makeup applied. Perhaps then it is the ideal form of Johnsons highly specific niche. The idea at its purest when the Rock being the Rock But Askance was a novel thing. You could even say that Johnson has spent almost two and a half decade long acting career chasing the same high as Tsunkatse but finds himself unable replicate the joy of the first time he could turn the Rock into a transmedium performance. Everything that Dwayne Johnson isat the height of his wrestling career then at the height of his acting one nowis in the Pendari Champion. The taciturn nature breaking ever so slightly for a trademark Peoples Eyebrow. The canonization of the Rock Bottom as the second greatest act of martial combat in Star Trek just behind the doublefisted punch. The fact that he barely has dialogue the fact that his costume had to have a very cheap harness put in so he actually looked slightly different than he does on any regular episode of Smackdown. It is the embrace of Johnson entirely into a bizarro Star Trek plot about trying to escape a dangerous alien fight club he is there to be Johnson and yet not Johnson. Is Dwayne Johnson the Pendari Champion or is the Rock the Pendari Champion We have Star Trek Voyager to thank for this timeless question the humble ridiculous episode of television that launched the only career capable of tanking an entire superhero movie universe in one go. At least Seven of Nine survived a Rock Bottom the DCEU couldnt.

And, okay fine.…",https://gizmodo.com/m3gan-movie-review-blumhouse-james-wan-allison-williams-1849944498,M3GAN is going to surprise a lot of people. From the trailers and slightly tongueincheek internet hype many are probably expecting a bonkers murderfest starring a deadeyed artificially intelligent killer doll in the mold of Childs Play. And okay fine. It is that to an extent. But the majority of the movie is infinitely more serious and sad resulting in a slightly imbalanced but nevertheless rewarding experience. Directed by Gerard Johnstone M3GAN was written by Akela Cooper Malignant from a story by Cooper and James Wan Saw Insidious. Wan also produces along with Jason Blum and from that list of names you might think you can pigeonhole the film as your typical crowdpleasing horror movie. But that changes in the films first twovery different and impactfulscenes. There we meet Cady Violet McGraw a young girl whose parents are killed in an unimaginable tragedy. The loss forces Cadys aunt Gemma Allison Williams to become her guardian which is not something Gemma was planning for professionally or ready for personally. Gemma works at Funki a toy company specializing in innovative robots and was secretly working on something very special before Cady came into her life. You guessed it. M3GAN. While the character and concept of M3GAN short for Model 3 Generative Android is introduced early in the film early on Cooper and Johnstone dive much more prominently into the struggles of Cady and Gemma. The film explores Cadys grief and loneliness Gemmas subconscious resentment and the strained relationship all of that begets. The pressures of Gemmas boss at Funki Ronny Chieng are also a constant concern. Its a seemingly despondent situation and when even doctors cant help Gemma decides to introduce Cady to M3GAN. Their quick bond and friendship feel like the perfect solution. Cady now has someonesomething to talk to and Gemma sees dollar signs as her experimental AI doll has infinitely more potential than she ever saw possible. Very little of that is in the films trailers and with good reason. People sitting down to see a movie about a psycho killer doll might not expect to grapple with themes like overwhelming loss forced responsibility or corporate greed. The aim in doing so of course is to give the audience a deeper understanding of the characters and distinguish M3GAN from other movies its so obviously inspired by. Both work to an extent but the films pedigree and expectations loom large. As all this happens you cant help but wonder when is this going to get fun Within those serious story beats hints of M3GANs plan begin to show. A knowing glance here. A curious edit there. And though it takes a little longer than one might hope things then escalate exponentially. Eventually M3GAN gives us a handful of shocking horror scenes that will have you both shielding your eyes and laughing out loud. Because while M3GANs subject matter is deadly serious the way it handles its horror is not. The films PG13 rating means there isnt a ton of blood on screen so instead the horror is campy and uncomfortable with a nice dash of humor to break the tension. All of this is more than welcome because it balances the heartbreaking intense and emotional journeys of Cady and Gemma. Soon the film slides to the complete opposite side of the spectrum and M3GAN just gets better and better as it happens. By the time M3GAN reaches its final stages it feels like a whole other movie. After being so focused on the harsh realities of life once its no longer beholden to them its as if a weight has been lifted. That we know and understand the characters so well from the first half of the movie adds a little but more than anything you just get the sense the movie was holding back the good stuff. And make no mistake its damn good stuff. The finale of M3GAN is simultaneously hilarious terrifying and well worth the wait. You just wish the movie leaned into that more often. M3GAN is half an exploration of reallife horrors and half a wild murder spree starring a killer doll. Each part of the film has its own merits and important takeaways but in the end the world we live in is so full of its own reallife horrors the offthewall escapism resonates much more. M3GAN is in theaters Friday.

While the concept of infinite parallel universes isnt exactly novelmost people have seen a Marvel movie or watched an episode of Rick Mortythe theory that we are now living in one that isnt ours is perhaps less wellknown. One proponent of this theory is Max Laughlin a thirteenyearold boy who uses the Mandela Effect a phenomenon where people have memories of events that conflict with the general consensus or established documentation to support his claims that we have all somehow phaseshifted into The Darkest Timeline. Watch Max explain his thoughts on this on TikTok user malloryrights video. While this no doubt causes scifi writers to salivate at the narrative possibilities it is worth reiterating that there is nothing to give this theory any credence. Perhaps more frightening is the reality that so many people would rather believe a child drawing on a napkin saying the sky has fallen down over the possibility that things might just be going so badly here on Planet Earth because of latestage capitalism.

These days courtesy of inapp payments and the ease of offering both a sample of a title alongside its fullfat version there are actually plenty of great games to play without spending a dime. Following the continued success of titles like Fortnite the level of quality across mobile PC and consoles has never been higher. Put your card away and consider this your starting point. Genshin Impact At launch many of us assumed Genshin Impact Zelda Breath of the Wild copy with impressive anime graphics and not much else. But this turned out to be a very different game Nintendos action RPG with over 50 characters at this point to play as. The world is rich and varied. Its also a huge accomplishment for a free game thats found a huge chunk of its audience on smartphones. While battles with foes form a major part of the game a lot of the joy and satisfaction comes from customizing that army of characters building up a collection of loot and strengthening them further. While there is an entire microtransaction system baked into the game much of the game is playable and enjoyable without having to spend a dime. Did we mention its totally gorgeousPlay Genshin Impact Overwatch 2 Even though Blizzard has improved the onramp for new players this time around Overwatch 2 Overwatch 2 has a deceptively simple goal stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win. Its much more complex in practice. To the untrained eye matches may seem like colorful chaos but Overwatch 2 has a deceptively simple goal stand on or near an objective and keep the other team away long enough to win. Its much more complex in practice. Blizzard reduced the number of players on each team from six to five. That along with acrosstheboard character tweaks has made gameplay fasterpaced and more enjoyable than the original Overwatch. Theres a greater emphasis on individual impact but youll still need to work well with your teammates to secure a victory. Now featuring a cast of more than 30 heroes each with distinct abilities and playstyles youll surely find a few Overwatch 2 characters that you can connect with. The first batch of new heroes are all a blast to play. There are many great though often fairly expensive new skins to kit them out with too. The game looks and sounds terrific too thanks to Blizzards trademark level of polish. At least until you figure out how to play Overwatch 2 you can marvel at how good it looks. Fortnite Battle Royale Fortnite is a social space as much as it is a game. Where else can you see SpiderMan doing John Cenas You Cant See Me taunt next to Indiana Jones dancing to a Dua Lipa song or Ariana Grande hanging out with Goku while you catch up with friends in voice chat It also happens to be a great video game with a clear path to victory. Drop onto the island grab some weapons and gear and try to be the last player or team standing as a storm pushes survivors closer to each other. Epic made Fortnite far more approachable earlier this year when it introduced a Zero Build mode which prevents players from building structures for cover. If you have the skills to box an opponent into a skyscraper in mere seconds by all means go for it in the other modes but Zero Build levels the playing field for new players. Fall Guys Fall Guys is a different flavor of battle royale. Sure there can still only be one player or squad standing tall at the end but there are no guns in sight here. Its essentially a platformer in the vein of MXC or Takeshis Castle in which only a certain number of players will qualify from each obstacleladen round. Its also maybe the goofiest and purely enjoyable multiplayer game around. You dont necessarily need to win to have a good time. Its hard to feel aggrieved even when another player shoves you off a ledge to knock you out. It rarely feels meanspirited even when another player messes with you. With developer Mediatonic adding more levels and cute cosmetics fairly frequently the game rarely feels stale. Whenever you return to Fall Guys after a break youll probably run into a new type of bedlam. Apex Legends From the studio that brought you Titanfall Apex is a 60player deathmatch with teams consisting of three people each. The goal is for your team to be the last one standing in Kings Canyon where youll have to loot and fight your way to survival using characters like Octane an adrenaline junkie whose ultimate move is deploying a jump pad that catapults you into the air for sneak attacks. You can download it and use the majority of Apexs characters without having to spend any money. That said you will have to shell out some cash to access to certain content including weapon skins and new characters such as Wattson. If you dont like the cartoonish aspect of Fortnite and if youre a fan of the actionpacked Titanfall gameplay it doesnt get much better than Apex. Dota 2 Play Dota 2 Dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of any game. Only after sinking hundreds upon hundreds of hours into the fiveonfive MOBA can you even begin to understand the deep game mechanics 100 unique characters and team strategies. But the fact Dota 2 is so challenging makes those big plays and hardfought victories all the more satisfying. The skyhigh skill ceiling means theres always something to learn and if you eventually make it into the pro ranks one tournament win can turn you into an overnight millionaire. Pokmon Go When Pokmon Go launched in 2016 there were some obvious omissions such as trading and playerversusplayer trainer battles. Now almost every problem and missing feature has been addressed. The game isnt perfect but the fundamentals walking around outside spinning Pokstop signs and catching critters make this a truly unique and healthbeneficial experience for Pokemon fans. The daily research quests and timed events which boost the appearance of certain monsters are a great excuse to log in every day. Niantic continues to expand the Pokdex too so that your collection is never quite finished. Call of Duty Warzone For years Fortnite was the battle royale of choice for younger players until Call of Duty Warzone came along. Boosting by interest during the pandemic the freetoplay battle royale has persisted through numerous iterations of the Call of Duty franchise with new maps game modes and weapons helping to push the player base above the 100 million mark. The core game requires you to either drop in solo or as part of a team and duke it out with up to 149 other players running between different points of interest to forage for weapons tactical items and vehicles. If that wasnt enough a wall of gas will force you into increasingly tight areas. Play Call of Duty Warzone Warzone offers some fresh takes on the traditional battle royale formula. For example if you die you will be sent to the Gulag to fight with other downed players for a onetime chance to redeploy back into the game. Should you lose teammates can still buy your return but requires them to first earn enough ingame money to afford it. Following the release of Modern Warfare 2 Warzone was overhauled. It got a new map Al Mazrah which is the largest playzone in the games history. Loadouts a system that allowed players to customize a Primary and Secondary Weapon Tacticals Lethals and three Perks before the game have been changed too.,2022-12-21T16:30:45Z,No Headline,Extremely Negative,260,"issues, frustrating, hard, controversial",-,lawsuit,engadget
87,"Jeremy Renner was 'completely crushed' by snowplow, according to 911 call log",Jeremy Renner shared a video from the ICU shortly after 911 call records detailed some of the injuries he suffered in a recent snowplow accident.,https://news.yahoo.com/jeremy-renner-completely-crushed-snowplow-180150367.html,Jeremy Renner was completely crushed by snowplow according to 911 call log A 911 call log from the Washoe County Sheriffs Office has detailed some of the injuries Jeremy Renner suffered in a snowplow accident on New Years Day. Obtained by CNN through a public records request the call log states that Renner was completely crushed under a large snowcat during the incident on Mt. Rose Highway in Nevada. The MerriamWebster dictionary defines a snowcat as a tracklaying vehicle for travel on snow. The Washoe County Sheriffs Office would not confirm the contents of the CNN report when contacted Thursday by the Los Angeles Times. Record of an emergency call placed Sunday at 855 a. m. Pacific Time states that the Marvel actor was run over by the vehicle per CNN. According to the Reno GazetteJournal Renner keeps a snowplow at his home located on the side of a snowy mountain near the Mt. Rose ski slopes. In a press conference this week the Washoe County Sheriffs Office identified Renners plow as a 14000pound Tucker SnoCat. The call log noted that the responding person who dialed 911 was screaming while informing the dispatcher that Renner was down after being struck by the plow. The Hawkeye star could be heard moaning loudly in the background of the call the log continues. At the time of the call Renner was bleeding heavily from his head and other unknown injuries according to the log which added that the caller wasnt sure where all the blood is coming from. The log proceeded to detail some of the injuries noting that the right side of Renners chest had collapsed while his upper torso had been crushed. Despite suffering all kinds of injuries the twotime Oscar nominee was conscious and breathing with extreme difficulty when the call was placed the log said. About 49 minutes after 911 was contacted a helicopter transported Renner to the hospital CNN reported. After undergoing surgery Monday Renner was in critical but stable condition according to his representative. On Thursday morning Renner shared a video on his Instagram story of himself enjoying a spa moment with his mother and sister in the ICU. In the clip one woman can be seen massaging Renners head while another smiles at his hospital bedside. ICU spa moment to lift my spirits Renner captioned the selfie video which shows him wearing an oxygen mask over his bruised face. Thank you mama. Thank you sister. Thank all of you For your love. During a Tuesday press conference Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam explained the circumstances surrounding Renners accident and evacuation. He said the emergency response that day was delayed by the weather conditions after the Lake Tahoe area had been buried under 3 feet of snow forcing roads to close and drivers to abandon their vehicles. The sheriff revealed that Renner had been using his snowplow to pull his car which was being driven by a relative out of the snow. Renner had just hopped out of his snowplow to talk with his family member when the SnoCat began to roll on its own Balaam said. While attempting to prevent the snowplow from rolling further Renner failed to jump inside the vehicle which then ran him over before coming to a stop in a pile of snow. Investigators will inspect the snowplow for possible mechanical failure to determine why it started to roll Balaam said. In the wake of the accident Renner has received an outpouring of love and support from his fans friends and Marvel costars including Mark Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth Chris Evans Chris Pratt Paul Bettany Alaqua Cox Josh Brolin and Vera Farmiga. Renner portrays Clint Barton a. k. a. Hawkeye in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Thank you all for your kind words Renner said Tuesday on Instagram. Im too messed up now to type. But I send love to you all.

89,"The “Black Panther”-Inspired Lexus RX 500h “Vibe-Branium,” Designed by adidas SEED Students","An all-woman team unites the Marvel Cinematic Universe with automotive and footwear design To celebrate the release of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Lexus partnered with adidas, Calty Design Research and 3D-printing company Carbon on the Lexus RX 500h “Vibe…",http://coolhunting.com/design/the-black-panther-inspired-lexus-rx-500h-vibe-branium-designed-by-adidas-seed-students/,To celebrate the release of Black Panther Wakanda Forever Lexus partnered with adidas Calty Design Research and 3Dprinting company Carbon on the Lexus RX 500h VibeBranium a custom RX F Sport designed by women students from adidas School of Experiential Education in Design SEED. Over the course of four to five weeks the studentswho have never designed a vehicle beforecollaboratively created a bold and nuanced Black Pantherinspired car as well as an adidas performance line the Wakanda Forever Collection. Tasked with the challenge of creating a design that not only nods to the new Marvel movie but also unites the values of the luxury automaker and sportswear company the students first had to find a throughline that married cars footwear and the film. After researching materials lighting and fabrication and virtually attending workshops from Calty Lexus adidas and Carbon creatives the allwoman team found a unifying concept innovation and empowerment. Our tagline says Luwam Gezai one of the students at SEED is empowereducate a woman educate a nation. From there the students created a mood board to see how to best realize their theme divvying up the car by sections to each work on. Another student designer from the project Deziah Green tells us We could have went in any direction with this but we wanted to create an overall feeling and we did that through color and material. Seeing the presentation from Lexus and Caltytheir brand values their process their mood boardswe wanted to evoke that same thing. The cars black and purple colors are a direct nod to the movie while gold accents traditional prints and striking patterns lend the car sophistication and an air of regality. Everywhere the vehicle blends subtle and direct allusions to the film. On the exterior a customized wrap is suffused with clean modern lines imagining a print that could have come from Wakanda. Inlayed across the hood is a diamond pattern that mirrors the claw necklace worn by the films hero. Inside natural materials merge alongside the technological including lasercut wood ballistic nylon and traditional quilting. We wanted to tie in natural elements from the film into the car because a lot of the film is taking in nature a lot of it is outdoors. The wood feature represents a tree and its roots and going back to the roots. Thats what we wanted to emphasize in the car by bringing in some of those natural elements. The artisan patterns you see are engraved with technology so its merging technology and natural elements continues Green. Another thing that led us to that adds SEED designer Caleb Williams is seeing that theme in the first film of tradition versus the progression of technology. We translated that story when it came to materials. The steering wheel pad and front and rear headrests feature the innovative 3Dprinted material that makes up the adidas 4DFWD midsole a technology that uses five million lattice variations to evenly absorb pressure and return it as energy. 4DFWD much like Wakandas energyabsorbing fictional metal Vibranium represents the brands and movies themes of progress and momentum. It also alludes to the brains behind technological innovation in the movie the sister to Black Panther and Princess of Wakanda Shuri. As a car built around empowerment and conceived by an allwomen team it makes sense that Shuris presence surrounds VibeBranium. There was a scene where she took the Kimoyo Beads from TChalla and hes like Theres nothing wrong with them theyre fine. Shes like Theres always room for improvement says a student designer at SEED who worked on the project Casmin Paul. Its no coincidence that the sneakers Shuri wears in Wakanda Forever are also the 4DFWD. In the custom car and sportswear collection concept mirrors practice. Conceptually the pair embodies the power and innovation of women and through the realization of either it does the very same. Given that this is the first project we worked on it really gives confidence to the designs that youre working on. Its knowing that you were given this project you deserve to be here continues Williams. Providing young and often overlooked designers the opportunity and resources to showcase their work Lexus and adidas SEED aptly honor the Black Panther films.

The shares have been hit by pandemic disruptions management issues and the wider market downturn. The media giants shares are trading close to an eightyear low. Disney stock has plunged 45 this year leaving it poised to deliver its worst annual performance in nearly five decades as a profusion of challenges continues to bedevil the media giant. Shares of Disney closed almost 5 lower Monday after the longawaited Avatar The Way of Water had a disappointing opening weekend in movie theaters. They rallied as much as 2 on Tuesday. The stock is now trading at 2014 levels on a splitadjusted basis and remains on track for its largest yearly decline since 1974 according to CNBC. The painful selloff has erased about 200 billion from Disneys market capitalization since March 2021. Disneys business stretches from blockbuster movies to TV shows cable channels theme parks resorts cruises retail stores video games and streaming entertainment. Unsurprisingly it was hit hard by the travel restrictions production disruptions and closures of cinemas stores and entertainment venues seen during the COVID19 pandemic. While most of its operations have now reopened they havent fully recovered yet. One bright spot has been Disney Plus which has grown its paid subscribers from about 27 million at the end of 2019 to 164 million as of October 1. Yet investors have balked at the streaming services rising costs which fueled a hefty 1. 5 billion operating loss in Disneys streaming division last quarter. Disney stock has also been caught up in a wider market downturn. Inflation has surged to 40year highs this year spurring the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates from virtually zero in March to over 4 today in a bid to slow the pace of price increases. However rising prices and borrowing costs are squeezing consumers and businesses. Theyre also dragging down asset prices and fanning fears of a recession and slump in company earnings next year. The entertainment titan weathered some bad publicity during Bob Chapeks tenure as CEO. However Bob Iger who masterminded Disneys acquisitions of Marvel Pixar and Lucasfilm took back the companys reins in November sparking an uplift in its stock price and revitalizing investors hopes of a turnaround.
