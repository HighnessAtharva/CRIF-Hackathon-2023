2,Guy Allegedly Stole Hundreds Of Thousands From Work And Then Lost It All On GameStop,"Crime never pays. Unless you get away with it. Ermenildo “Ernie” Castro seemingly did not.

Unless you get away with it. Ermenildo Ernie Castro seemingly did not. The former software engineer at Zulily is accused of stealing over 300000 from the online retailer through a scheme straight out of the 1999 slacker revenge movie Office Space. He now claims the moneys all gone telling police he lost most of it betting on GameStop meme stock options. Documents filed by prosecutors in Kings County Superior Court last month detail an audacious scheme by a white collar worker to rip off his bosses a scheme whose execution left more than a little to be desired. Charged with two counts of felony theft and one count of felony identity theft Castro allegedly manipulated the code on Zulilys checkout page to siphon off at least 261885 in shipping fees into his personal Stripe banking account. He then allegedly proceeded to change the prices on products paying pennies on the dollar for them and having them shipped directly to his home where they piled up in front of his door. Prosecutors claim he stole 40842 this way for a total theft amount of 302278. 52. When interviewed by police after his arrest Castro admitted the figure could have been even higher but said the money was all gone. He clarified that he had used the money to invest in stock options particularly GameStop stock options the court documents read. Its unclear which exact options he bet on that left him zeroed out by the meme stock. According to prosecutors Castro began skimming off the top of Zulilys transactions in February 2022. The company became aware of the discrepancies the following month and ordered Castro and others to investigate. Thats when he allegedly updated the code to double charge customers. The company had also started to flag the unusual purchases shipping to Castros home. In June a fellow employee visited to investigate and found several Zulily labeled boxes piled outside of the homes front door and driveway. Vertagear 800 Series Gaming Chair Ergonomic comfort Adjustable seat height neck support memory foam pillow adjustable back rest and tilt locking system and 4D armrests that move in 4 directions to fit you best. Castro told Zulily and police that the purchases were just test orders that he just forgot to cancel. However email records allegedly show Castro ordering stuff specifically for a woman he met on Tinder. She would send him links to stuff she wanted and he would respond back with a heart emoji to show it had been purchased. When asked about this by police Castro was unable to provide an immediate answer and ultimately said he placed the orders for her in order to peacock. Castro returned his work laptop on June 9 when he was fired which also didnt do him any favors. When Zulily searched it the company reportedly discovered a OneApp file named OfficeSpace Project. Prosecutors say it went through his scheme in detail including adjustments he made to try and keep it hidden from management. Asked by police Castro even admitted that Office Space a movie about workers selfactualizing by stealing small amounts of money from millions of company transactions was what the scheme in the file was named after. Its unclear who Castros attorney was or if he ever called one. Possibly cementing the case for police was what they reportedly discovered when they searched Castros home. After executing a warrant on July 21 they claimed to have located an exorbitant number of Zulily orders many still in their original packaging. Among them was a Gray Linen Convertible Sofa Bed priced at 565. 99 that Castro allegedly only paid 1 for. Maybe he should have tried to sell it to GameStop. Castros arraignment is scheduled for later this month. At 16 a share GameStops stock is currently lower than at any time since the Office Space plan allegedly started to unfold. But it is possible the funds are still out there somewhere. Prosecutors believe Castro may have made preparations prior to his arrest. In one part of the OfficeSpace Project document he reportedly wrote Prepare offgrid backup plan.,Match Group rolls out campaign to stop romance scams,Extremely Negative,430,"scams, scams, exploitation, scams, scams, losses, scam, losses, unsuspecting, harms, scam, desperation, scams, bad","fraud, fraud","Buddy, Loomis"
3,Fiction to look out for in 2023,"With new work from Richard Ford, Lorrie Moore and Zadie Smith, plus second novels by Caleb Azumah Nelson and Guy Gunaratne, this is shaping up to be a memorable 12 months<ul><li>Nonfiction to look out for in 2023</li></ul>During the lockdown years, I kept rea…",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/01/fiction-to-look-out-for-in-2023,During the lockdown years I kept reading articles by novelists saying how unproductive they were feeling how virus narratives had colonised their subconscious minds destroying the creative impulse. 2023s novels or at least those of them Ive read suggest otherwise. Its an extraordinary crop with memorable books from both celebrated and lesserknown authors. As usual Ive concentrated on those released in the first half of the year and have left first novels to the New Reviews best debut novelists feature. Lets start with some big names. Theres inevitable excitement surrounding a new Bret Easton Ellis. The Shards Swift January is a riotous tale of privilege and psychosis at a swanky prep school. After the horrors of last year its splendid that Salman Rushdie has a new novel out Victory City Jonathan Cape February. Better still its a cracker. Purportedly a rediscovered ancient epic its about the transformative power of human creativity the enduring ability of art to shape the world. Birnam Wood by Eleanor Catton Granta March comes 10 years after the Bookerwinning The Luminaries and is worth the long wait. Full of wit big ideas and the most beautiful writing its the story of a group of guerrilla gardeners who clash with a billionaire prepper. I loved it. To be honest 2023 feels like a monthbymonth parade of my favourite writers. Theres new work from Benjamin Myers Cuddy Bloomsbury March Shy Faber April Deborah Levy August Blue Hamish Hamilton May and Amanda Craig The Three Graces Abacus June. Theres Richard Fords fifth and final Frank Bascombe book Be Mine Bloomsbury June in which Bascombe now entering his own last years takes his terminally ill son on a trip to Mount Rushmore. Theres also a new novel from the great Paul Murray. The Bee Sting Hamish Hamilton June is the tale of a dysfunctional family trying to hold things together. Its a thing of beauty a novel that will fill your heart. Another welcome return is Lorrie Moores I Am Homeless If This Is Not My Home Faber June. Her first novel since A Gate at the Stairs 2009 this is an uncanny tale stretched between the 19th century and the present. Im always interested in second novels in the vulnerability of the followup. Aybmi Adby was shortlisted for the Womens prize for her debut Stay With Me. Now with A Spell of Good Things Canongate February she has delivered a poised and luminous love story set against the backdrop of a violent contemporary Nigeria. New Review best debut alumnus Caleb Azumah Nelsons Open Water was a slim masterpiece. His second novel Small Worlds Viking May is a similarly lapidary comingofage story set over three years in the life of an extraordinary young man. Another New Review pick Guy Gunaratne won a host of prizes with their first novel In Our Mad and Furious City. Their enthralling second Mister Mister Tinder May is about the enigmatic Yahya Bas sitting mute in a government detention centre after being captured in Syria. Finally perhaps spurred by his brother Richards success Mat Osman has written a superb second novel. The Ghost Theatre Bloomsbury May finds its way into the hidden corners of Elizabethan London telling the story of a group of misfit actors. Beautifully written and completely convincing. A few more to look out for theres a blast from the past in the form of Michael Bracewell whose Unfinished Business White Rabbit January is his first novel in more than two decades. The story of a putupon everyman it is a sad and quietly devastating portrait of middleaged life in suburbia. Meg Clothier is best known for her YA historical novels but her first adult work The Book of Eve Wildfire March is a wonderfully rich and absorbing tale. With nods to Umberto Eco it tells the story of Beatrice the librarian of a convent who comes into possession of a book of dark and stunning power. Chinese author Wang Xiaobo died aged just 44 in 1997 but his masterpiece Golden Age Penguin April has now been translated into English for the first time by Yan Yan. Its a scabrous bawdy novel set in the years of the Cultural Revolution. Its also very moving. Han Kang is back with Greek Lessons Hamish Hamilton April beautifully translated by Deborah Smith and Emily Yae Won. Lastly James Hynes is wellknown in the US but the 67yearold has never been published in the UK before. Sparrow Picador May is a stunning work of historical imagination. The story of a young man making his name in the dying days of the Roman empire Sparrow is masterful in its portrayal of love sex and friendship. Finally two novels to look forward to later in the year. The Fraud by Zadie Smith Hamish Hamilton September is a wonderfully rich historical novel based on a reallife trial. With two memorable central characters it looks at the darkness that underpinned the triumphant exceptionalism of Victorian Britain. Sebastian Faulkss Modern Love Hutchinson September is a work of visionary ambition. Set in the future its partmystery partromance all told with typical panache. Whatever else the year ahead brings at least we have this collection of supremely good novels to comfort challenge instruct and entertain us through it.,Guy Allegedly Stole Hundreds Of Thousands From Work And Then Lost It All On GameStop,Extremely Negative,520,"stealing, revenge, lost, audacious, stole, unclear, unable, stealing, unclear, exorbitant",Crime,"Ermenildo, Ernie, Castro, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit, Castro, lawsuit, Castro, Castro, Castro, Castros, Castro, Zulily, Castro, Castro, Castro, Zulily, Castro, lawsuit, Castros, Castros, Castro, Castros, lawsuit, Castro"
4,‘I went downhill’: man falsely accused of rape on becoming a hate figure,Jordan Trengove faced trial after being accused by Eleanor Williams after a night out in 2019When 18-year-old Jordan Trengove agreed to go on a night out with Eleanor Williams in 2019 he had no idea that accepting her invitation would not just land him in jai…,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jan/03/i-went-downhill-man-falsely-accused-of-on-becoming-a-hate-figure,When 18yearold Jordan Trengove agreed to go on a night out with Eleanor Williams in 2019 he had no idea that accepting her invitation would not just land him in jail but make him the enemy of a global antigrooming movement with its own line of merchandise. The teenagers and some friends went drinking in Barrow on 9 March 2019 and as far as Trengove can remember Williams disappeared halfway through the night. He didnt pay much attention because he was distracted by another girl Ebony that evening. Ebony ended up with him in the back of a police van after officers spotted him arguing at a taxi rank in the early hours. They said youre drunk lets take you home remembers Trengove. The duo were dropped off at a friends house and ended up having sex on the sofa according to Ebony when she was called to give evidence at Williamss trial more than three years later. Weeks passed and one day Trengove was asleep in bed when police arrived to arrest him on suspicion of raping drugging and assaulting Williams. He protested his innocence and cooperated with police handing over his phone and submitting to an intimate body check so that officers could look for signs of the violent struggle Williams had described. There was no bruising no markings says Trengove now. But the damage was done. The next day someone painted the word rapist on his house and smashed in the windows. Before he knew it he was in court being remanded in custody charged with three counts of rape. Williams had produced evidence that Trengove had admitted to the rapes goading her on Snapchat calling her a dirty slag who was well up for a shag that night. It took police all too long to realise that this Snapchat account had been created using the wifi at the Barrow home of Williamss mother. Prison was very very scary he said. I was put in cells with actual rapists and paedophiles. I shared with a man who admitted to me he was guilty of sending pictures to eightyearold kids. Trengove spent his 19th birthday in prison serving 10 weeks on remand before police realised the evidence against him didnt stack up. The girl Trengove actually had sex with on 9 March gave police a selfie she had taken in the back of the police van while suspicion grew that far from being a particularly unlucky victim of multiple rapes Eleanor Williams was in fact a fantasist making one false allegation after the other with the help of social media. Not only did she create fake profiles to frame Trengove and some of her other victims she started up explicit conversations with innocent men on Tinder Snapchat or the intimate photo sharing site OnlyFans where she had an account and renamed them in her phone so that it looked as though their penis photos and propositions were coming from those she falsely accused. Out of jail Trengove was a free man but an outcast in Barrow. I was barred from everywhere. I was called a rapist a nonce. Within a few months he moved away. I thought it would end but the first day we moved in I had someone shout rapist at me. It was clear then that no matter where I went someone would always know. Things calmed down and then on 20 May 2020 Williams posted the fatal Facebook page alleging that she had been trafficked and exploited by an Asian grooming gang. She didnt name Trengove but his name soon became linked with the case regardless of his skin colour as more than 100000 people joined the Justice For Ellie Facebook page and bought elephantthemed wristbands keyrings and bumper stickers to express solidarity. A rally was organised where convoys of cars drove from Barrow to the town where Trengove now lives flying Justice for Ellie banners. He tried to tell protesters the truth but no one would listen. I went downhill he said. I tried killing myself over it. I tried running away from it all. I tried ending my relationship walking away from my family. The amount of problems put on my life just from one Facebook post is ridiculous. Because Im autistic its even harder. I got diagnosed with complex PTSD because of it all. Ever since this went on I feel like Ive been trapped in my own little prison he added. I dont feel like I have a life any more. Trengove became a father in August 2021 but struggled to bond with his son as Williamss trial kept getting postponed. When I was in his newborn stage I couldnt love him like a dad should. I tried to distance myself away. My whole life just became sitting in playing video games. That was the way of escaping the reality of my life. Trengove now 22 was in court on Tuesday to hear the jury find Williams guilty of eight counts of perverting the course of justice including three involving him. Im over the moon he said afterwards pledging to go home and give his son a big hug. Ive got my life back.,Fiction to look out for in 2023,Somewhat Positive,330,"unproductive, virus, inevitable, clash, Sting, violent, Furious, misfit, Unfinished, sad, devastating, dark, dying, darkness","adult, died, sex, Fraud","Bret, Easton, Ellis, Salman, Rushdie, Eleanor, Catton, Benjamin, Myers, Cuddy, Bloomsbury, Shy, Faber, Deborah, Levy, Blue, Hamish, Hamilton, Amanda, Craig, Richard, Fords, Frank, Bascombe, Bascombe, Paul, Murray, Hamish, Hamilton, Lorrie, Moores, Aybmi, Adby, Caleb, Azumah, Nelsons, Guy, Gunaratne, Yahya, Bas, Richards, Mat, Osman, Michael, Bracewell, Meg, Clothier, Umberto, Eco, Beatrice, Wang, Xiaobo, Yan, Yan, Han, Kang, Deborah, Smith, Emily, Yae, Won, James, Hynes, Sparrow, Zadie, Smith, Hamish, Hamilton, Sebastian, Faulkss, Modern"
5,'Fleishman Is in Trouble' Is One of the Best TV Shows of 2022 - CNET,Binge the first seven episodes before the Dec. 29 finale.,https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/fleishman-is-in-trouble-is-one-of-the-best-tv-shows-of-2022/,If Gone Girl were given the recuttrailer treatment in the style of a Woody Allen film it would probably look a lot like Fleishman Is In Trouble. The smart Hulu limited series based on Taffy BrodesserAkners novel of the same name is now streaming with the finale airing Dec. 29. Its got the failed marriage the sad sack 40something white man and most importantly the missing wife. But its also filled with anxious neurotic New York Jews philosophical walkandtalks money and sex. Lots of sex. Toby Fleishman Jesse Eisenberg is a newly divorced liver doctor with two kids who kinda hate him and a bachelor pad thats fairly realistic in its dinginess complete with a broken set of vertical blinds. Despite his sadsackery Tobys status is on the rise on the apps at least. Read more The Very Best TV Shows of 2022 Formerly unlucky in love with an undiagnosed eating disorder and a chip on his shoulder that both predate his marriage Toby cant believe his newfound social capital as a middleaged divorcee within the likes of Tinder a universe that didnt exist last time he was on the market. Suddenly hes drowning in sexts from available single women who send photos of their side boob or their underboob or their just plain regular boob says the shows very opinionated narrator. The identity of the narrator at least to those who havent read the book is a bit of a spoiler. But the TV adaptation gives it away halfway through episode 1 and even sooner if you recognize Lizzy Caplans sardonic lilt. Caplan plays Tobys collegeera friend Libby a prematurely retired journalist reluctant Jersey stayathomemom and a bit of a sad sack herself. Libbys got her own set of issues the show hints. Toby is reconnecting with his college friends the trio rounded out by Adam Brody playing another charming Seth whom he hasnt seen much since getting married. At first glance Tobys exwife ladderclimbing talent agent Rachel Fleishman played by Claire Danes in a power suit is the clear villain. Shes got the blunt bob of a careerist virago and a lowboiling resentment kindled by the typical anxieties of the Upper East Side upstart plus too many emails to respond to. But the shows interest in first glances is only to the extent they can be subverted. Things arent what they seem. When we meet Toby Rachel has just unexpectedly skipped town for a yoga retreat leaving Toby to care for both kids. I have to secure my oxygen mask you know Before theirs she says. The minor inconvenience slowly builds to dread as Rachel misses phone calls texts and kid pickup and Toby realizes shes actually perhaps gone missing. Yes she was a terrible person Libby narrates as Toby begins to panic but bad things happen to terrible people too. At times Libbys streamofconsciousness voiceover is distracting making the scenes feel like documentary reenactments. But Libbys perspective is also a welcome antidote to Tobys general my ex is crazy vibe which likely will dampen most viewers sympathies. The first two episodes may try the limits of your patience for the richwhitemaleness of it all. But youll be rewarded if you make it to episode 3. Like Gone Girl and other Rashomonstyle marriage stories that delight and indict the audience by pulling the rug out Lauren Groffs Fates and Furies HBOs Scenes From a Marriage Fleishmans swinging fulcrum a single line delivered by the always excellent J. Smith Cameron as Tobys divorce lawyer will make you sit up in your chair and say oh damn The shows title overlaid on an upsidedown NYC skyline doesnt specify which Fleishman is in trouble after all. The mystery of Rachels whereabouts is less of a driving plot and more of an excuse to examine how two people looking in the same direction can see such different views. If youre hoping for intrigue stick with Gone Girl. But Hulus adaptation is thrilling in other more literary ways thanks to BrodesserAkner executive producing and writing all but one episode. The novel so interior and so cerebral seemed at first an odd choice for the streaming TV treatment. But somehow the show pulls it off giving the viewer that same joy of picking up what an astute writers putting down. The ever regenerative liver Tobys medical specialty is a recurring motif. His sons science project also becomes a theme generator with forays into relativity and block universe theory that signal the series more highbrow aspirations and give the show the opportunity to introduce fantastical visual effects reminiscent of HBO Maxs highly literary Station Eleven adaptation. The novelesque elements if at times a little on the nose er liver mostly work. Even the oxygen mask analogy manages to transcend its own cliche with a clever midseason callback. And the shrewd television adaptation achieves the same balancing act that was its source materials major triumph recreating the novels deliciously slow recalibration of allegiance.

6,What Is Ghosting on Social Networks? How to Deal With It,Have you sent someone a message on social media or on dating apps and not received a reply? You might've been ghosted. Here's what to do.,https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ghosting-explained/,Have you ever been chatting to someone on social media then they suddenly go quiet What about if youre talking on Tinder or another dating app then they dont respond You might be a victim of ghosting. So what is the meaning of ghosting How do you know youve fallen for it And what can you do about being ghosted What Is Ghosting Lack of communication can be really annoying and demoralizing particularly in the age of online socializing. And especially when it comes to your love life Ghosting is simply when someone youre messaging suddenly goes quiet effectively breaking your potential friendship or relationship without a word uttered. They go silent on you. They become ghosts. Its very easy to identify youre talking to someone via messaging apps and the other person simply doesnt respond. It can happen on any social media network even WhatsApp but ghosting is typically associated with dating apps. Its harsh but true many of us will have received the cold shoulder after going on a date. But if you met someone via Tinder no matter your expectations on the relationship developing you at least deserve replies to your messages. You deserve closure. Ghosting could happen immediately or after a few messages. Most likely ghosting occurs following a oneoff date often arranged through dating sites or apps like Tinder or Bumble. It might be after a few meetups. Or on rarer occasions it could be after a longterm relationshipthe harshest of all. In some ways its social rejection and that hurts. No one wants to feel like theres something wrong with them or that they did something wrong. The worse thing about ghosting is the feeling of frustration it leaves you with. You simply dont know why theyve stopped responding. You mightve offended them. They might not have liked you. They could have lost their phone. They couldve been knocked over by a car. Or its possible theyre actually jerks who dont want to reply anymore. Saying that it can be a small mercy if you werent that interested either. Why Would Anyone Ghost Someone Else Ghosting is one of the downsides of social networking yet its anything but new. Its just a new label. This is the equivalent of someone not returning a phone call voicemail answering machine message or email. Technology however is an enabler and apps have made this worse. Why Because we all have an online persona. Typically youre more confident online than facetoface. The internet gives you some anonymity. Thats why comment sections can be vile and Twitter a minefield. But everyone has their reasons. On dating apps for instance the other party may simply be worried about admitting theyre just not into the person theyre ghosting. People have got to get on well. Theres got to be an attraction there. Whereas most of us would admit that some would prefer to keep quiet. Alternatively mistakes happen. They couldve swiped right accidentally and once youve attempted to start a conversation they dont follow up. Would you prefer the ghoster stays silent or say I swiped by mistake Im not interested Remember photos lie. That matters when dating apps only let you publicize yourself initially through a few images and a short biography. If someone decides that profile pictures arent an accurate representation of you they might not respond to messages or even block you. What about social media Someone can ghost you on Facebook Twitter Snapchat or any network but why They might not know how to respond. Or lets not forget the main reason someone is quiet theyre busy Normal life can intrude on social media and the former is definitely more important than the latter. What Should You Do if Someone Ghosts You Lets say youre on the receiving end or more accurately the notreceiving end. Youve sent messages and got no response. What do you do Here are a few options. Send an Understanding Message Try a lastditch attempt. You dont have to address your worries that youre being ghosted you can simply ask Hey is everything okay Ive not heard from you in a while and am starting to worry. Accept that people do forget to reply to messages sometimes. They might not mean to ghost you. A conciliatory message could prompt them into finally responding. This is about checking their intentions. Remember Its Not Your Fault It really isnt your fault. This is all on the person who is ghosting you. Its their doing not yours. Do not blame yourself or even get paranoid about it although that is admittedly easier said than done. Something else might be the matter which has taken up their time and occupied their mind. Accept that people are fallible. Talk to a Friend This is the sort of thing that weighs on your mind. As they say a burden shared is a burden halved. Talk to a close friend or family member about whats happened. Make sure its someone who really cares for you that way you dont feel you have to hide your feelings. You friend might be able to offer advice or if the person in question is a mutual friend they could shine a light on why the person in question has gone quiet. If youre being ghosted on a dating service chatting about it might help you accept the fact that a relationship youd hoped for wasnt going to happen. Give Up on Them Are they really worth your time Seriously they cant be bothered to send you one single message so why should you worry about them Go silent too. Youll forget all about them pretty soon. Everything Happens for a Reason This is a good philosophy to adopt. In the case of dating your matchs inactivity is a godsend. Better you find out they can be like this now than six months down the line after being in a relationship. If theyre playing their hand early on at least you know the two of you arent compatible. It might sound tough but simply move on. There are better people out there more deserving of you. What Should Ghosters Do Weve been through how ghosters might rationalize the act but its still brutal. A final note for anyone who ghosts others imagine being in their shoes. Youre really searching Tinder for someone to love and care for. You go on a date and that person seems perfect for you. You get home and send them a message. No reply. You try again. Nothing. The person who seemed perfect for you actually isnt interested. Worse than that they dont even have enough respect for you to break the news gently. Friendship too is out of the window. Theres always another way even if it makes you feel awkward. In conclusion just dont ghost people.,'Fleishman Is in Trouble' Is One of the Best TV Shows of 2022,Extremely Positive,620,"Trouble, limited, sad, sack, anxious, hate, broken, unlucky, disorder, drowning, opinionated, sardonic, reluctant, sad, sack, issues, blunt, resentment, anxieties, unexpectedly, retreat, inconvenience, dread, misses, terrible, panic, bad, terrible, distracting, crazy, limits, trouble, mystery, plot, excuse, odd, cliche, slow","sex, sex, boob, boob, damn","Woody, Allen, Taffy, BrodesserAkners, novel, Toby, Fleishman, Jesse, Eisenberg, Tobys, Toby, Lizzy, Caplans, Caplan, Tobys, Libby, Libbys, Toby, Adam, Brody, Seth, Tobys, Rachel, Fleishman, Claire, Danes, Toby, Rachel, Toby, Rachel, Toby, Libby, Toby, Libbys, Libbys, Tobys, Rashomonstyle, Lauren, Groffs, Fleishmans, J., Smith, Cameron, Tobys, Fleishman, Rachels, Hulus, BrodesserAkner, Tobys"
7,The Magnificently Stupid IRL 'Office Space' Caper,"We're going to need you to come into the police station, mmkay?",https://www.cracked.com/article_36519_the-magnificently-stupid-irl-office-space-caper.html,The Magnificently Stupid IRL Office Space Caper Movie fans love acting out their favorite bits from awesome movies whether its cosplaying it up as Drax at ComicCon or rolling multisided dice to RP a sweet Ghostbusters adventure. And in the case of one Office Space superfan You concoct a codecorrupting scheme to skim hundreds of thousands of dollars from your employer. Thats hardcore fandom Authorities are accusing software engineer Ermenildo Ernie Castro of acting out his Office Space fantasies scamming his former employer Zulily out of 300000 and change. The crux of the plan straight out of the movies involved rewriting code on the online retailers checkout page to divert a fraction of shipping fees to Castro himself. Where could such a scheme go wrong Let us count the ways You could allegedly use your company laptop to pull off the scheme. You could allegedly create a file on that company laptop detailing how you intended to rip off your employer. You could allegedly name that file OfficeSpace Project. When you get fired you could allegedly return that laptop to your employer where it could find the file containing your sneaky plans. You could allegedly use your coding skills to order company products for pennies then leave them piled up in your driveway for curious coworkers to find. You could allegedly admit to the police that your OfficeSpace Project file was named for the moneyskimming scheme from Office Space. Of course no Peter Gibbons roleplay would be complete without a lovely lady to woo. Castro also allegedly ordered a number of practically free Zulily products for delivery to a gal he met on Tinder. With 40000 worth of swag delivered to Castro and his online love interest its the ultimate expression of flair. What an alleged dumbass. But of course it gets dumber. Castro claims to no longer have the money he swiped losing it all by investing it in GameStop stock options. Whats left Not much not even a stapler although theyre available to order on Zulily.

9,‘We’re only seeing the negative’: UK farmers on Brexit and losing the common agricultural policy,"In the third of our series looking at the impact of the Brexit trade deal, the Guardian talks to farmers about the difficulties they faceSitting in his 18th-century farmhouse in the uplands of Bethlehem, in the breathtaking western reaches of the Brecon Beaco…",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/29/uk-farmers-impact-brexit-trade-deal-losing-common-agricultural-policy,Sitting in his 18thcentury farmhouse in the uplands of Bethlehem in the breathtaking western reaches of the Brecon Beacons Ian Rickman ponders the damage Brexit has done to his future. Two years since the UK quit the EU the future for mountain sheepfarmers such as him is full of economic precarity. He has lost unfettered access to his nearest export market faces reduction in farm subsidies as the result of the loss of the common agricultural policy CAP and has been disadvantaged by trade deals giving access to the UK market to rival farmers from Australia and New Zealand. From a sheep farmers point of view theres no good outcome from those trade deals says Rickman. Their predominant international markets are China and the far east. Why give them access to the UK At the moment we are fine but if for some reason there were God forbid a Ukrainiantype situation in the far east and sanctions imposed overnight they will use the huge access to our market he says. It is a subject that jangles the nerves of farmers across Wales who see Brexit as all downside. A great deal is something more beneficial to agriculture. At the moment we havent were only seeing the negative says Rickman. Theres no way you can dress those trade deals up as a as a good thing. Ive heard farmers say the industry was more or less chucked under a bus. Guto Bebb the managing director of the Farmers Union of Wales FUW says his counterparts in Australia are very pleased with the contingency they now have if the Chinese market were to be closed off. But wheres our insurance policy after losing the single market We dont have one he says. A study by the statutory levy body the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board has concluded that New Zealand exports to the UK would rise by about 13000 tonnes 31 if China imposed a 25 tariff on New Zealand lamb imports and 29000 tonnes 69 if there was an outright ban. Energy prices for everyone are going through the roof while at the same time the cost of selling to the EU which represents 33 of the lamb export market has also spiralled. A crossindustry veterinary and environmental health group the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Certification Working Group estimated that the new requirement for export health certificates signed off by a vet added 60m to the cost of food exports to Europe in 2021. It hasnt been doomsday but it is a question of more and more problems being added to trade says Bebb. Brexit barriers are so unnecessary and for so little gain. Mountain sheep farming is a tough business with many hill farmers unable to survive without subsidies threatening not just livelihoods but the presence of a farmer as pastoral keeper of the land which in Rickmans case is part of one of Waless national parks. Before returning to the subject of Brexit Rickman talks of the importance of sheep grazing the uplands to keep grasses down and minimising the risk of climate change wildfires with tinder dry detritus building up. Sitting in his kitchen Rickman explains how his farming sector has been cushioned from the worst of Brexit as inflation has driven up the price of red meat. Figures for 202021 show income from cattle and sheep farming in less favoured areas up 32 to 29900. In other years it has been dangerously low in 2017 the president of the FUW said it had dipped to 13000 less than half the national average wage. Brexit the government said was about giving farmers for the first time in 50 years the chance to do things differently. George Eustice then the environment secretary asserted in 2020 that it makes no sense to subsidise land ownership and tenure where the largest subsidy payments too often go to the wealthiest landowners. Among the beneficiaries of CAP direct payments which were made per hectare were the Brexiter James Dyson who received more than 5m from the EU and the former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre who pocketed 88000 for his Scottish Langwell estate in one year alone. But the National Farmers Union NFU and the FUW fear for the small farmers who are dependent on the CAP. MPs on the Welsh affairs committee expressed concern in 2022 that around a fifth of Welsh farms had a farm business income of less than zero with an average income of 26000 per farm. Government research shows that the subsidy is the difference between profit and loss for 42 of farms in the UK. Launched in 1962 as a partnership between agriculture and society the CAP was envisaged as an income support scheme after research showed farmers income was 40 lower than nonagricultural incomes. I dont get government support EU subsidy and then squirrel it away in my Swiss bank account or go off to Barbados. That doesnt happen. That money goes straight out to the local businesses says Rickman referring the vet the mechanic the feed supplier and the fence contractor. Farming is the backbone of the rural economy. Agriculture is a devolved competency and as Wales is still designing the replacement for the CAP farmers such as Rickman are still getting direct payments. But Wales has accused Westminster of a political sleight of hand when carving up the amounts across the four nations of the UK. The FUW has calculated Wales will be 225m down over the life of the current parliament on the basis that it had not yet used up all of the EU funding. It is political games. We take the view that the Westminster government is guilty of breaching a manifesto promise that it would match spending pound for pound says Bebb. Just because some of the money has not been spent does not mean it has not been allocated to a project. Weve had a bypass near me open recently that was funded by the EU in 2020. You are allowed overhangs if projects take time to get up and running and completed he adds. In Scotland there is a similar gripe. The country reckons it will lose out on approximately 93m between 202125. A Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs Defra spokesperson said The 2019 manifesto commitment maintains the annual farming budget of 2. 4bn until 202425 with all reductions from farmers direct payments being reinvested back into the sector. They added that the CAP did nothing to improve food production or food security and gave half the budget to the largest 10 of landowners. The replacement scheme would support the choices and incentivise better farming they said. In England the phasing out of the CAP is well under way with a new environmental land management scheme ELMs that will prioritise better practices in farming and environmental protection with financial incentives for moves such as reduction in fertiliser use or the maintenance of moorlands. Defra figures show that the phasing out of the CAP is already affecting farm incomes even though the replacement scheme is still sketchy. The progressive phasing out of the CAP has left farmers at least 20 down this year and they will be short by 50 of the previous EU subsidy in 2024 with the remaining money due to be reinvested in farming under the public money for public goods policy. By 2028 the practice of subsidising farmers per acre in England will have been eliminated the government says. Farmers in England are now receiving less support quite significantly less so that will impact incomes says Nick von Westenholz the director of trade and business strategy at the NFU. Most farmers still dont know what it is that theyll be signing up to in future years or what theyll have to do to meet the requirements of any new scheme he adds. Under the plan in England direct payments will be phased out completely by 2028. In its places under ELMs is a countryside stewardship scheme and the sustainable farming incentive SFI scheme. Defra says about 32000 farmers have already signed up to the countryside stewardship scheme up 90 since Brexit was signed off in 2020. The SFI scheme is still being piloted with new details to be announced in January. Farmers have expressed concern that the administration and resource needed to participate in the scheme reduce its attractiveness. If the payments dont make business sense you will find farmers wont sign up to the scheme says Von Westenholz. For the NFU which was vocal about the need to maintain trade and animal welfare standards Brexit is still causing uncertainty for farm businesses six years after the referendum. Brexit was always going to lead to considerable change for farm businesses in the UK with the end of free movement of labour and the CAP and a restructuring of our trading relationship with the EU and the rest of the world. But more than six years on from the referendum there is still massive uncertainty as to what that change actually looks like says Von Westenholz. And while trade deals with big agricultural exporterssuch as Australia and New Zealand have been struck thus increasing competition in the domestic market associated plans for increasing our exports and improving competitiveness appear to still be in the development phase he says while at the same time trade in agricultural products with our nearest neighbours in Europe has reduced dramatically. None of this is inevitable but it does need political will compromise and longterm planning to resolve says Von Westenholz. Regarding claims that British farming was being put at risk by trade deals a Defra spokesperson said the interests of our farmers and food producers is a priority of our trade policy and our trade deals are delivering on this. Our negotiations will continue to support farmers. In December the environment secretary Thrsa Coffey promised that the next batch of SFI payments to be unveiled in the new year would be easier and more beneficial to farmers. She pledged to have the full range of replacement supports in place by 2024 which would work whether you are a commoner upland farmer or small family farm.,Ms Marvel to Atlanta: it’s the ultimate festive streaming guide!,Extremely Positive,1390,"traitorous, betrayal, Rogue, dark, struggling, unexpected, fetid, ruin, evil, complicated, unpopular, funny, traumatic, fails, impoverished, backwoods, Slow, languish, Slow, dissolute, disgraced, misfit, lack, virus, laid, waste, perilously, jagged, mystery, Stranger, Sin, dark, prison, breaks, loose, fragile, funny, loss, melancholy, Crook, funny, Scared, macabre, darker, inescapable, strange, restless, bleak, dull, uncomfortable, wrong, difficult, fiction, blur, freak, uneasy, disses, Frozen, fragile, deceptively, peculiar, awkward, relentlessly, collapse, utterly, tragic, startling, risks, glut, enraging","queer, corruption, crime, radical, porn, murder, murder, crime, hell, adult, refugee, Adult, Fire, died","Abbi, Jacobson, DArcy, Carden, Chant, Adams, Kim, Philby, Guy, Pearce, Philbys, Damian, Lewis, Anna, Maxwell, Martin, Diego, Luna, Boris, Johnson, Dan, Stevens, Julia, Robertss, Martha, Mitchell, George, Tammy, Paramount, Tammy, Wynette, George, Jones, Jessica, Chastain, Michael, Shannons, Sarah, Lancashire, Catherine, Cawood, James, Nortons, Tommy, Lee, Royce, Ryan, Ophelia, Lovibond, Joyce, Doug, Jake, Johnson, Ms, Marvel, Disney, Kamala, Khan, Iman, Vellani, Kamala, William, Gibson, Gary, Oldmans, Jackson, Lamb, Tim, Burtons, Addams, Vicky, McClure, Johnny, Harris, McClure, Stella, Tomlinson, Charles, Stone, Harris, Dylan, Llewellyn, Jack, Danny, Jon, Pointing, Danny, Jacks, Mackenzie, Crook, Toby, Joness, Andy, Lance, John, Wilson, Louis, Therouxstyle, Jonathan, Meades, Wilson, Wilson, Liam, Williamss, Mo, Netflix, Mo, Amer, Mohammed, Najjar, Nathan, Fielder, Fielder, Stewart, Lee, SnowflakeTornado, Alan, Bennett, David, Attenboroughs, Pallass, Cat, Joe, Pera, Pera, Lizzo, Lizzo, Adam, Curtis, Werner, Herzogs, Katia, Maurice, Krafft, Simon, Leviev, Levievs"
10,The Bear Market Is Providing a Once-in-a-Generation Buying Opportunity for This Internet Stock,Investors are way too pessimistic right now about this online dating company.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/01/01/the-bear-market-is-providing-once-in-a-generation/,The SP 500 is down approximately 20 in 2022. This is one of worst years for stocks on record and the biggest annual drawdown for the index since the great financial crisis in 2008. But looking under the hood things have been much worse for certain individual stocks with 25 stocks down at least 50 in 2022. The secondworst performer of 2022 is online dating company Match Group MTCH 0. 15 which is down a massive 69 this year. The owner of Tinder Hinge and other online dating properties went through an executive transition and is facing major foreign currency headwinds at the moment which is driving investors away from the stock. Investors gave up on Match Group in 2022. Heres why this selling is misguided and why you should consider adding the online dating company to your portfolio. Match Group struggles in 2022 To give context investors need to understand why Match Group stock did so poorly in 2022. First it went through a CEO transition when Shar Dubey retired earlier this year. The board of directors brought in Bernard Kim a previous executive at mobile gaming company Zynga as the new leader of the business. After coming on board Kim took a good look at the operations at Match Groups various dating properties and did not like how things were run. He subsequently fired the Tinder leadership team due to poor product and monetization developments and brought in a new group to run the division. These failings are going to hurt Tinders revenue growth over the next few quarters. Since Tinder generates the majority of Match Groups revenue this will have a large impact on the overall topline growth for the company as well. On top of failures at Tinder Match Group is facing major foreign exchange headwinds due to the rising value of the U. S. dollar. Since Match Group is a global business but reports its financials in U. S. dollars changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect its revenue growth. In 2022 revenue growth is facing close to a doubledigit foreign exchange headwind. Add up both of these factors and Match Group now expects Tinders direct revenue to be flat year over year in the fourth quarter of 2022 which is a huge slowdown from 23 growth last year. Wall Street hates when revenue growth unexpectedly decelerates so it is no surprise that Match Group stock tanked in 2022. Why 2023 will be better You cant blame shortterm traders for selling Match Group through the end of 2022. The company is about to report poor results that may not get better for a few quarters. But if you are a longterm investor with a time horizon of several years Match Groups business looks healthy right now. First foreign exchange headwinds are not likely to be nearly as impactful over the next few years. In Q3 Tinders revenue grew 16 year over year on a currencyneutral basis but 6 year over year in U. S. dollar terms. This will not likely be repeated in 2023 and should help the company accelerate its revenue growth throughout 2023. Second there is still a longterm opportunity for online dating to grow in popularity around the globe. Tinder if it can fix its product issues with this new team in place is poised to benefit from this growth as it is still the leading dating app in the majority of markets. Third Match Group has a promising new application in Hinge that can drive revenue growth for many years. The app is for more relationshipfocused daters and has grown in popularity in Englishspeaking markets. In 2022 management expects the app to generate around 300 million in revenue. Over the next few years Hinge is going to expand into more international markets and hone in on monetization which should drive consistent topline growth. Combine this with the steady growth at Tinder and Match Group looks poised to grow revenue at a doubledigit rate for the foreseeable future. The stock is dirt cheap Match Group shares are cheap right now especially if you consider its longterm growth opportunity. At a market capitalization of 11. 6 billion and 641 million in operating income Im not using net income because of a onetime litigation payment in 2022 the stock trades at an earnings multiple of just 18 below the markets average earnings multiple of 20. MTCH Operating Income TTM data by YCharts For a company facing major shortterm headwinds and with a strong industry tailwind this seems like a discount for shareholders who have a time horizon of more than a few quarters. If you believe in growth of the online dating market the time is now to plug your nose take a plunge and buy some Match Group shares.,‘We’re only seeing the negative’: UK farmers on Brexit and losing the common agricultural policy,Extremely Negative,680,"damage, lost, loss, disadvantaged, rival, forbid, downside, negative, losing, doomsday, problems, unnecessary, unable, threatening, risk, worst, concern, loss, guilty, gripe, lose, sketchy, concern, struck, inevitable, risk","fear, welfare","Ian, Rickman, Rickman, God, Rickman, Guto, Bebb, harassment, lawsuit, Bebb, Rickmans, Rickman, Rickman, George, Eustice, James, Dyson, Paul, Dacre, Langwell, harassment, Rickman, Rickman, Bebb, Nick, von, Westenholz, Von, Westenholz, Von, Westenholz, Von, Westenholz, Thrsa, Coffey"
11,How Tinder Changed Everything,"In Land of the Giants: Dating Games, we’re examining whether the business of dating apps align with their users’ romantic goals. Our first episode dives into Tinder, and asks whether the swiping really leads to love — or just more money for Tinder.",http://www.thecut.com/2023/01/how-tinder-changed-dating.html,When Tinder launched in 2012 its creators didnt think much of it. We put together what would eventually become Tinder in about six to eight weeks and launched it says Jonathan Badeen one of Tinders cofounders and inventor of the swipe. The swipe was kind of like Tinders secret weapon it seems obvious now but a decade ago swiping transformed mobile dating by turning it into a kind of game. Swiping was fun and compulsive keeping users on the app for hours on end. It releases dopamine a chemical in your brain that gives you a sense of pleasure which according to Dinesh Moorjani another of Tinders cofounders kept users hooked on the platform. We had some users that were using the app north of 30 to 40 times a day. You can just kind of go down a rabbit hole and stay there for hours. You might even miss going out to a party because youre stuck in that loop adds Natasha Schull an anthropologist at NYU who studies technology and gaming design. She says that Tinder has the same gaming qualities as slot machines and users fall into the same kind of endless gaming loops she observed in Vegas gamblers. But does swiping lead to love In this season of Land of the Giants Dating Games were examining whether the business goals of datingapp companies align with their users romantic aspirations. Our first episode dives into Tinder and asks whether the swiping game really leads to connections or just more money for Tinder. By 2014 Tinder reported that it had made more than 2 billion matches but that doesnt mean 2 billion happy relationships. And while Tinders business model has been a success its consistently one of the topgrossing apps year after year its effect on users is less clear. I got on Tinder almost at the start and its been like my leash for a decade now says New York Magazine writer Allison Davis. Tinder is my longestrunning relationship.

12,Scotland’s pandas to return to China after Tian Tian ‘wouldn’t swipe right’ on Yang Guang,"Hugely disappointed zoo chiefs admits Yang Guang, the male giant panda, and female Tian Tian did not get on",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/01/01/scotlands-pandas-return-china-tian-tian-wouldnt-swipe-right/,Scotlands two pandas will return to China this year without producing any offspring because they just dont get on hugely disappointed zoo chiefs have said. David Field the chief executive of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland RZSS said female Tian Tian and male Yang Guang appeared to be a perfect match when they arrived from China in 2011. But he said the pandas did not click at their new Edinburgh Zoo home joking that perhaps Tian Tian wouldnt have swiped right if she was using the dating app Tinder. Now both aged 19 the pandas will return to China later this year without having any offspring despite numerous attempts at natural breeding and artificial insemination since 2013. Tian Tian also known as Sweetie produced twins prior to coming to Scotland but annual efforts to produce a cub in Scotland have failed. Yang Guang also known as Sunshine was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2018 and was later castrated. The RZSS which operates the zoo has confirmed that breeding will not be attempted during the animals remaining period in Scotland. Mr Field said Its hugely disappointing. Baby pandas are just beautiful. They are exquisite they are endearing they are glorious they are one of the most fantastic ambassadors for people falling back in love with nature. But I think the biggest disappointment has been for Tian Tian because that maternal cycle is really important for them as part of their natural behavioural repertoire everything from all the hormonal cycles to the nest building to rearing. Content and happy He said they were two very content and very happy pandas but added Sometimes animals just dont get on. Genetically they were apparently an extremely good match but behaviourally if it was Tinder perhaps Tian Tian wouldnt have swiped right if she had the choice. Despite the lack of offspring Mr Field said the RZSS and its partners could be proud of its contribution to giant panda breeding research while visitors have delighted in seeing the animals up close. He added They are hugely emblematic they are iconic for conservation and they make people smile with sheer abandonment. The pandas came to Scotland in 2011 on an initial tenyear arrangement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association. The first giant pandas in the UK for 17 years they flew into Edinburgh on a special Panda Express cargo plane. In December 2021 the RZSS announced it had negotiated a twoyear extension to the end of 2023 but officials recently revealed the pandas may return to China as early as October. They will eventually be replaced by another exciting species yet to be announced.,How Tinder Changed Everything,Extremely Positive,140,"swipe, swipe, compulsive, stuck, fall","weapon, hole","Jonathan, Badeen, Dinesh, Moorjani, Natasha, Schull, Allison, Davis"

Once back on campus and briefly talking inside his car she said Kohberger started being really pushy about coming into her room to watch another movie. She said that while she initially agreed she later pretended to loudly throw up in the bathroom before Kohbergerwho she said was waiting for her outside the bathroom doorleft. After an hour or so of him being gone he messaged me and said I had good birthing hips and I just never messaged back she added. Willette first detailed her story about a strange date with one of the most notorious murder suspects in America in a series of TikToks beginning on Sunday evening. Kohbergers lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. Authorities allege Kohberger 28 murdered four studentsKaylee Goncalves Ethan Chapin Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogenon Nov. 13 around 4 a. m. in Moscow Idaho. The firstyear Ph. D. student in criminology at Washington State University was extradited back to Idaho last week from Pennsylvania and is facing four counts of murder in the first degree and a burglary charge. But seven years before prosecutors say Kohberger committed the harrowing crimes Willette says he was a quiet but not shy psych major who had matched with her on the dating app one morning. Kohberger graduated from Northampton Community College in Bethlehem Pennsylvania with an associate degrees in psychology in 2018. Property records show that the Kohbergers have been living in their Lamsden Drive home since at least 2014. If Kohberger was living at his parents house at the time he would have been approximately 45 minutes from Willettes Hazleton dorm room. Willette provided The Daily Beast with texts she sent two of her friends on Jan. 2 after learning of Kohbergers arresta conversation in which one friend responded that she remembered the nurse telling her about the date in question previously. Willette told The Daily Beast that she chatted with Kohberger all morning and afternoon on the day of their date before he mentioned he wanted to go to the movies and asked if Id like to go with him. After agreeing to the date she said Kohberger had a movie in mindand while she does not remember the title she said she didnt really care to see whatever it was. I got off work and met him at the theater she said. He paid for my movie ticket but he didnt want popcorn so I ended up buying some for myself. We watched the movie and then he said he would take me back to my dorm. After driving her back to her dorm Willette said Kohberger ended up parking his car in a move she figured meant he just wanted to talk because we couldnt really talk during the movie. While she does not remember exactly what they discussed she said that after chatting for a while she told Kohberger she wanted to go back up to her dorm room and check to see if my roommate needs me and he said he would come with. Willette said that her roommate was not in their dorm room at the time and did not see Kohberger. Back inside her dorm room the pair sat down to start picking another movie to watch together Willette said. In her TikTok describing the date she also claimed that Kohberger kept trying to rub her shoulders and tickle her. When she asked him why he was touching her Willette said in her video that he got super serious and denied he was doing so which she described as gaslighting. She told The Daily Beast that Kohberger later followed her to the communal dorm female bathroom and waited outside the door. I thought that was the weirdest thing so I was like I need to get this guy to leave but I didnt wanna be mean so I started to pretend to loudly throw up she said. After a minute or two he messaged me on Tinder saying he was going to go. The two never spoke again she said after Kohberger sent her the curious followup text about her hips. She said that while Kohberger was very polite and nice during the date he completely changed gears when the pair got to her dorm. He just seemed very different she said. Definitely felt uncomfortable when he decided he needed to wait outside of the bathroom for me. Willette said in her TikTok that she decided to come forward with her story about Kohberger after seeing false information about herself online and to warn others about who they are meeting up with and maybe save another 19yearold girl from being stupid. It was shocking for sure Williette said about seeing Kohbergers mugshot. I dont know if Im a good judge of character either way but I dont feel surprised that he was arrested for it either.,"

Sure the year saw the expected Netflix truecrime series including the return of the hit Unsolved Mysteries reboot and celebrations of trailblazers Say Hey Willie Mays but we also got the lighthearted highspirited stories of unbelievable fraudsters The Tinder Swindler deeply disturbing stories of human evil Our Father and scandalous stories of corporate evil White Hot The Rise Fall of Abercrombie Fitch. The genre is in undergoing a bit of a boom. For lovers of nonfiction filmmaking it feels like we have more options now than ever. Last years critical hit Flee redefined what a documentary film looks like paving the way for the critically acclaimed Canadian animated documentary Eternal Spring. Apple TV released a speculative nature documentary series depicting an imagined cretaceous period with Prehistoric Planet. Neons trippy indie hit Moonage Daydream celebrates David Bowie in a manner wholly unique and fitting for the experimental pop star. Sure we got some of the expected goodoldfashioned documentaries in 2022 but we also got a slew of films and TV series pushing the limits of what the genre looks and feels like. The best documentaries of 2022 are the ones that balance factual content with exceptional execution. I personally feel that one should walk away from the viewing experience with a newfound understanding or appreciation for a subject. Its not enough to just tell an interesting story it needs to be told particularly well. There are lots of great documentaries that are released each year but it takes something special to be the best. 12. Light Magic The Disney docuseries Light Magic is essential viewing for film nerds history buffs like myself. The sixseries tells the story of one of if not the most influential special effects studios in the world Industrial Light Magic. ILM revolutionized the moviemaking industry with the visuals it created for Star Wars A New Hope in 1977 then just titled Star Wars and continued to up the ante with groundbreaking mindmelting set pieces in films like Raiders of the Lost Arc Nazi face melting Poltergeist a house implodes and Jurassic Park realistic dinos all accomplished with cuttingedge techniques. Light Magic covers the history of ILM from George Lucas founding of the studio to the presentday innovations. The documentary uses a combination of talking head segments archival footage and old photos to celebrate the men and women who put ILM on the map. Big names like Steven Spielberg and James Cameron lend a level of prestige to the content while less widely known creatives like stopmotion specialist Phil Tippett and artist and supervisor Dennis Muren provide fascinating behindthescenes insight into some of Hollywoods most famous special effects sequences. Theres a reason why Light Magic is at the bottom of this list as interesting as the documentary is it often feels biased. The series struggles to obfuscate the fact that the ILMs glory days are past sure the special effects studio still produces great work but they arent untouchable industry leaders anymore. Disney owns Lucasfilm which in turn owns ILM making the objectivity and motives behind this Disney original a bit sus as the kids say. It reads as slightly dishonest putting a bit of a bitter aftertaste on an otherwise fantastic docuseries. 11. Web of Make Believe Death Lies the Internet Netflix does true crime well but with Web of Make Believe Death Lies the Internet the streaming giant offers something a little different. The docuseries is a horrifying exploration of the dark side of internet culture but not too dark At least not yet looking at everything from virtual sex crimes to the rise of white nationalist groups. The first episode offers a really brutally honest look at the danger of swatting and also the kind of narcissism and immaturity that encourages and rewards that kind of behavior online. The third episode Im Not a Nazi presents an eyeopening look at the insidious ways altright groups operate online. The final episodes a twoparter called The Stingray begins as a general story of two hackers but transforms into an investigation of the ethical problems with the tech used by law enforcement. Netflixs Web of Make Believe is a strong collection of documentaries with a unique angle. Even those who live online far too much like myself Ill need to touch grass once the snow melts will likely be surprised by the major reveals and twists herein. Not every episode is perfect I personally found A Murder in D. C. a bit boring and the Sextortion episode although interesting and tastefully done did feel tonally inconsistent with the rest of the series. Still though I turned this Netflix docuseries on at random and found myself unable to pull away. 10. All the Beauty and the Bloodshed One part artist biography one part social issues expos and two parts unapologetic celebration of queer subcultures Laura Poitras documentary All the Beauty and the Bloodshed is easily one of the most personal documentaries of 2022. The film centers on photographer Nan Goldin and her advocacy work challenging the Sackler family particularly their role in creating the opioid epidemic. The Sacklers controlled Purdue Pharma which produced the highly addictive painkiller OxyContin. Knowing how dangerous the drug was the company heavily marketed it regardless then used that money to buy public prestige in the form of large donations to cultural institutions in exchange for getting a building or scholarship named after the family often museums. It makes sense for someone like Goldin to take them down not only is she a reputable artist wellknown in the global art community but she a recovering opioid addict herself thanks to OxyContin. Like with Casa Susanna All the Beauty and the Bloodshed benefits from a high level of historic photographs. Goldins portfolio serves as an unapologetically gritty backdrop showing viewers the lives of gay lesbian and transgender New Yorkers in the early 80s and the unique community they created along with Nans transition into activism during the AIDS epidemic. The film reverberates with a punk rock energy that is irresistible and inspiring. Unfortunately Poitras documentary bites off a bit more than it can chew. The opening shots of the Sackler protests are dramatic and compelling but the film struggles to keep up that momentum. Whats more not much time is spent on explaining the wrongdoing of Purdue and by extension the Sackler family so those interested in that topic will need to supplement that elsewhere. 9. Downfall The Case Against Boeing Netflixs Downfall The Case Against Boeing is a chilling look at how a companys reputation can flip almost overnight. Boeing was once one of the most respected American manufacturing companies known for its engineering excellence and commitment to bestinclass quality. However following the merger with McDonnell Douglas in the mid90s the companys culture changed internally leading to a slip in those onceleading standards. As the documentary presents the resultant costcutting measures led to the tragic Boeing 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019. In October 2018 Lion Air Flight 610 a domestic flight in Indonesia crashed shortly after takeoff killing everyone onboard. Then in March 2019 less than six months later Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 also crashed just minutes after the plane became airborne. Both planes involved were the brandnew MAX 8 designs. Although the manufacturer did its best to skirt responsibility and maintain the safety of its planes eventually Boeing did ground its fleet of 737 MAX airliners but not before hundreds of innocent people tragically lost their lives. Downfall The Case Against Boeing documents the companys history from its trailblazing beginnings to its public fall from grace. For those interested in understanding why the 737s crashed the film presents an easytofollow investigation into the faulty system responsible for the planes malfunction as well as the contributing factors namely some moneysaving shortcuts that had disastrous repercussions. This is one of those cautionary tales about corporate greed that will make you think twice about putting faith in a brand name. 8. Disney Channels Theme A History Mystery Defunctland I bet you werent expecting to see a YouTube documentary on here Defunctlands most recent upload Disney Channels Theme A History Mystery is a bonafide documentary complete with archival images and interviews with people involved. As a 30something Canadian woman who spent her teen years listening to Led Zep and learning to play Nirvana songs I dont have much nostalgia for the Disney Channel nor its theme but Defunctlands earnest fascination with the subject had my rapt attention. Defunctland is a YouTube channel created by Kevin Perjurer with videos that document defunct amusement park rides and other related lost media mostly old TV shows. The videos are essentially a fond exploration of 80s 90s and early aughts nostalgia with an emphasis on history and cultural studies. Fitting with the rest of the channel Disney Channels Theme is essentially an investigation into an influential pop culture relic that went underrecognized at the time. Despite how iconic the short channel ID sequences were the origins of Disney Channels sound signature is unknown or at least it was until Defunctland busted that mystery wide open. Disney Channels Theme A History Mystery is a really heartfelt passionate exploration of what is admittedly a pretty niche topic. Its also just very well done. As is often the case with Perjurers videos the production itself is a step above most of whats on the platform. The 90minute documentary is wellpaced using compelling visual segments to great effect. Theres also a message at the end and a real genuinely unexpected twist at the end both great elements that make the viewing experience that much more satisfying. The video is not without flaws it is severely limited by clear budget constraints as well as access to star talent and general resources. Still though being able to take what could easily be dismissed as an irrelevant or frivolous bit of trivia and turning it into an engaging story is impressive for any documentary let alone something selfproduced for YouTube. 7. The Janes HBOs 2022 documentary The Janes is a brutally honest portrayal of life before Roe v. Wade. The film tells the story of The Janes a network of activists who defied American law to help women find safe and affordable access to abortions. Its a retrospective that serves a purpose reminding us all whats at stake if the laws are changed. Whether youre personally prochoice or prolife The Janes forces the viewer to confront an uncomfortable reality when abortion access is limited women die. HBO is known for its documentaries and The Janes lives up to the networks reputation. While nothing groundbreaking is happening here the documentary is solid if conventional. The subject matter isnt exactly ripe for exploration the film isnt eyeopening like Paradise Lost or Beware the Slenderman nor is it personal and intimate like Jane Fonda in Five Acts or Robin Williams Come Inside My Mind but it is particularly relevant at this moment in history especially for American audiences. Whats impressive though is how empowering The Janes feels. Women have a right to bodily autonomy and The Janes doesnt waste anyones time by arguing that perspective as though theres a counterpoint its not up for debate. Without ever feeling preachy or needlessly provocative the documentary simply presents the facts openly and honestly then celebrates the women who dedicated their lives and risked their freedom to help people in need. 6. Eternal Spring Eternal Spring is Canadas official entry for the 2023 Oscars and not just in the Documentary Feature Film and Animated Feature Film categories but also in the International Feature Film category. That more than anything speaks to how special this documentary is. Eternal Spring tells the story of an infamous hijacking and the subsequent fallout for those involved. In 2022 members of an outlawed spiritual practice Falon Gong took over the feed for a governmentcontrolled TV broadcast in Changchun China using the equipment to directly contradict the governments messaging and set the record straight about their religion. For comic artist Daxiong best known for his work on Justice League and Star Wars this move meant he had to flee his home. For many of his fellow practitioners the consequences were far far worse. Daxiong largely leads the story using his artwork rendered in 3D animation to recreate the events. The style really emphasizes the handdrawn aspect including textures evoking the streaky imperfect look of marker fill. The aesthetic this creates in Eternal Spring is really unique I was actually reminded of the Wii game Mad World which Im sure no one except me remembers I loved it but essentially was like gritty illustrated action brought to life. Daxiong has a personal stake in the story making the inclusion of his artwork additionally meaningful. The movie draws comparisons to Flee but here the animation has a more integral role in the story rather than just being the medium used to tell the story. 5. We Need To Talk About Cosby We Need To Talk About Cosby is by no means fun to watch documentaries concerned with uncovering uncomfortable truths very rarely are. And of course Bill Cosbys shocking release from prison in 2021 only adds another layer of frustration and disgust to an already horrendous nauseating story of abuse exploitation and assault. Yet writerdirector W. Kamau Bell composes his fourpart docuseries with such care that this hardtotalkabout topic becomes impossible to ignore. Showtimes We Need To Talk About Cosby is what the title implies a necessary conversation about Americas Dad. Comedian and bonafide pop culture fixture Bill Cosby was virtually untouchable for decades and even today has supporters despite overwhelming evidence of his misdeeds. Bell responds to this with an honest and frank discussion rather than wallow in the horrific actions and lingering trauma something true crime is far too often guilty of the director presents a case for how the man became such an important role model especially for Black communities in America. After laying the groundwork for Cosbys celebrity status and infallibility he empowers women to tell their stories of abuse as well as the ways in which Cosbys fame and reputation made them doubt their own experiences. These combined forces created a perfect storm for sexual predation to flourish. We are living in a post MeToo age but we should not rest on our laurels. We Need To Talk About Cosby is essential viewing for anyone who can stomach the topic because it does such an excellent job of investigating the ways that social power and celebrity can warp critical thinking. Those who still are unable to accept that the gentle JellOselling sweaterloving father figure is a monster are not stupid or evil theyre just trapped in an ideology that was designed to trap them. 4. Prehistoric Planet Did you know that the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex could swim Or that the terrifying Carnotaurus the primary antagonist in Disneys Dinosaur may have used his ittybitty forearms for an adorable mating ritual These are just some of the theories I learned from watching Apple TVs Prehistoric Planet a fivepart series produced by BBC Studios. Following in the footsteps of the BBCs landmark nature documentary Planet Earth Prehistoric Planet pushes the envelope for the subgenre Unlike most dinosaurbased documentaries this series uses photorealistic CGI to depict its subjects interacting with their environment achieving a degree of realism unlike anything audiences have seen before. With Jon Favreau as showrunner David Attenborough as narrator and Hans Zimmer as one of the composers theres a ton of talent behind Prehistoric Planet and it shows. Sure dinosaurs have become more prevalent onscreen over the last few decades thanks to the Jurassic Park franchise and movies like Disneys Dinosaur but its still genuinely very fun and gratifying to watch these giants stomp around the cretaceous period. Seeing a TRex stomp through suburbia in The Lost World is cool and all but its ultimately fantasy. The sequences in Prehistoric Planet are equally as manufactured but the appeal is that we might be seeing something that really did happen. And this is the highest quality visuals we have so far when it comes to scientifically accurate CGI renderings. While this is a truly excellent offering and easily one of the best documentaries of 2022 the docuseries does suffer from a few minor shortcomings. By adhering to the general formula of other BBC nature docs i. e. Planet Earth Life etc. Prehistoric Planet robbed itself of muchneeded context that could have aided the viewing process such as subtitles to keep track of names like quetzalcoatlus or kaikaifilu or talking head segments with paleontologists to explain what evidence the theories are based on. 3. The Colour of Ink Brian D. Johnsons The Colour of Ink is a Canadian documentary that had me enthralled from beginning to end. I never expected to love this film but the topic was mildly interesting and I like to support Canadian filmmakers. What I saw however absolutely blew me away. The Colour of Ink is a beautiful vibrant celebration of art throughout the ages with a focus on ink itself. The documentary follows Toronto artist and smallbatch inkmaker Jason Logan as he interviews other artists who work with the medium. What begins as a personal journey into Logans world gradually spreads out to a much larger and more philosophical discussion of the role art plays in human history and the pleasure to be found in working with the ephemeral. The artists he talks to all have their own fascinating stories which contribute to the documentarys overall celebration of unique perspectives and individuality. Industrial ink today is manufactured to be consistent and permanent. The ink Logan creates however is much more natural and organic it is made from items he encounters out in the world and is not intended to last forever. As he tells Margaret Atwood in one scene thats the whole point. The best documentaries are those that take unassuming niche ideas and manage to craft a compelling film exploring the topic. The Colour of Ink achieves this in spades. Johnsons direction in is mesmerizing the cinematography is gorgeous presenting the art and nature at its center as impossibly grand. This is one of those films that demands to be seen on a large screen in 4K Ultra HD not because its exciting or actionpacked but because theres just so much to see. 2. Moonage Daydream I never really got into David Bowie. Apart from the odd standout Heroes Space Oddity Rebel Rebel etc. his albums just didnt speak to me. Id put them on occasionally I had his complete discography on my iPod Nano an ancient device teens used back when cell phones were less commonplace and looked a bit like TV remotes but the music never really grabbed me. Id think it was good just not great. The 2022 documentary Moonage Daydream taught me something its not that I never got into David Bowie I never got David Bowie. His music isnt meant to be the background soundtrack to every day. Its visual its performative and it demands to be seen. His art is daring expressive and weirdly kind. Theres an inclusivity to his work that I didnt appreciate until now. Written directed and produced by Brett Morgen Moonage Daydream is a trippy vivid and vibrant story of who David Bowie was told through clips of old interviews performances and more. But unlike last years Get Back Moonage Daydream is more than just pure historical footage Morgen artfully combines music interview audio and archival footage with original video imagery some of which is very abstract to communicate ideas. We the audience are not passive observers were being told Bowies story told through his own words but like weve never seen before. An extrasensory montage that is highly effective and endlessly compelling. Its about the best posthumous tribute imaginable but my God I am devastated every time I reflect on how this bright beautiful human being was taken from the world too soon. 1. Fire of Love Ive never seen a film quite like Fire of Love before. The National Geographic documentary is the story of Katia and Maurice Krafft two volcanologists who fell in love and dedicated their lives to pursuing their shared passion the science of volcanoes. These bold French researchers chased volcanic activity around the world getting upcloseandpersonal footage of eruptions lava flows and other related phenomena. It was a pursuit that contributed to our understanding of the natural world but one that would ultimately cost them their lives. Throughout their careers Katia and Maurice Krafft became minor celebrities in the relatively small world of volcanology thanks to the somewhat unorthodox nature of their partnership and their undeniable onscreen chemistry. The two were able to fund their expeditions through selling their findings in the form of documentaries books lectures etc. which means that Katia and Maurice left behind not only a rich archive of onsite materials but also footage of themselves doing publicity circuit interviews. Director Sara Dosa uses these various resources to celebrate the volcanologists using the material to investigate who they were as scientists explorers and lovers. Fire of Live makes best use of the visual medium combining various strategies to engage audiences. The documentary uses subtle tricks to meld the contemporary elements with the 43 screen ratio footage giving the film a retro quality throughout. Theres a playfulness to the couple that is echoed in the Dosas direction which is frank dignified and respectful. Dosa does not manipulate the couples image but rather attempts to show them as fully realized human beings warts and all. The narration provides muchneeded context and at times is reading directly from personal writings providing an audience a glimpse at Katia and Maurices inner lives. Its a deeply personal documentary and a truly magnificent entry in the genre.,Woman Describes Eerie Tinder Date With Idaho Murder Suspect Bryan Kohberger,Extremely Negative,780,"grisly, stumbled, uncomfortable, strange, notorious, allege, denied, pretend, uncomfortable, false, shocking","crime, Beast, murder, murder, crimes, Beast, Beast, Beast, stupid","Hayley, Willette, Willette, Bryan, Kohberger, Kohberger, Willette, Willette, Kohberger, Kohberger, Kohbergerwho, Willette, Kohbergers, lawsuit, Kohberger, studentsKaylee, Goncalves, Ethan, Chapin, Xana, Kernodle, Madison, Mogenon, Kohberger, Willette, Kohberger, Kohbergers, Kohberger, Willette, Kohbergers, Willette, Kohberger, Kohberger, Willette, Kohberger, Kohberger, Willette, Kohberger, Willette, Kohberger, Willette, Kohberger, Kohberger, Kohberger, Willette, Kohberger, Williette, Kohbergers"
15,It Turns Out the “Adult” Hook-Up App Really Works for Women. But There’s a Catch.,"Humans, alas, sometimes behave like humans.",https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/12/feeld-app-female-experiences-middle-aged-dating.html,Feeld Notes is a column about a middleaged woman who suddenly realizes she wants to have sex againand the beguiling app she uses to do it. I dont like the men on dating apps. As in I dont press like. Im engaged in a passive dynamic with all of the platforms wherein I sit back and wait for men to approach me and then accept or reject their attempts to match. My friend Emily thinks this is a big mistake. You should go after what you want she says. Not let what you want be decided by who goes after you. She has a point. Waiting to be noticed and affirmed by men is just another way of enacting my decadeslong tendency to try to solicit or engineer male approval and then feel grateful when I get any at all. Knowing that a guy likes me first relieves me of some of the risk of rejection though it doesnt make those actual rejections any easier to take. Theres also a selfrighteousness about the posture I adopt. I like to tell myself that meeting men in this way is a protest of how dating apps strip users of their humanity. Ive always felt uneasy about the swipe right swipe left upordown interfaces. So I tell myself that by responding to others initial efforts but not putting forth any of my own Im somehow rising above a dynamic of making splitsecond decisions about another persons romantic or sexual potential. Put another way If I dont like or dislike them first I cant be accused of treating the apps as one friend put it as if it they are neverending carousels of human meat. Feeld is different. Sort of. One of the apps more interesting features is that unlike say places like Hinge or Tinder moving through a collection of profiles doesnt require disliking one profile to see the next. On Feeld you can scroll though as many profiles as you want like some and leave the others alone. Theyll still be there for later. Read My Foray Into the Adult HookUp App Taught Me a Lesson About Men Now This plus the fact that Feeld refers to its users as humans34 humans liked you I was informed the other dayfeels like a wellmeaning attempt to imbue the apps users with a sense of collective responsibility toward one another. Though bad behavior still abounds I appreciate the effort. And sometimes the effort pays off. I had a lovely experience with a humanwell call him Seththe other week. It was a Friday afternoon and I opened the app to find five or six new likes from men none of whom interested me much. Except Seth. Though I got close to passing on himhis profile didnt say much and he wasnt exactly my physical typesomething kept me from clicking away. Feeld users have an inbox of sorts that collects all the likes a user has receivedlikes that one can either accept by clicking a heart icon or dismiss by clicking on a minus sign. Im glad I didnt. Twenty minutes after matching Seth messaged me a hello. I was impressed by his general demeanor He was curious and interested and open about who he was a thirtysomething with an enormous sex drive and what he was looking for trust and transparency and real connection. And on top of that he didnt seem to want to fuck around and text for too long After an hour of back and forth he asked me out on a date for that very night. We made a plan to meet at a bar near my place. A few weeks ago my therapist in an effort to help me identify and define my emotional and sexual boundaries created a taxonomy of sorts for the guys I encounter online Track 1 and Track 2. Track 1 guys are guys that I actually might date i. e. get into a romantic relationship with. Track 2 guys are those I might simply sleep with. Making a distinction between these two types of men or how I relate to them will she hopes protect me from getting hurt or disappointed and prevent me from confusing one thing sex for another love. Which I have a tendency to do. Seth was neither a Track 1 nor a Track 2 guy he fell somewhere in between. We met early in the evening630 or soat a French wine bar and talked for hours About our careers about our upbringings our families our friends our fears. When he suggested we move the conversation back to my place I balked. It wasnt that I didnt want to be with himmore that I did. Despite the fact that many of men on Feeld claim a disinterest in onenight stands or as the acronym goes ONS many of the actual interactions Ive had have been exactly that. Just as they did before the advent of dating apps some men have a tendency to fade away or disappear altogether. Later at my apartment we lounged on my couch and talked. Eventually he asked if he could kiss me. I said yes and we quickly moved my bedroom. We kissed some more. Eventually his shirt came off then mine. He massaged and sucked my breasts. I asked him to get on his back and undid his jeans and heard the telltale crinkle of a pair of condoms in his pants pocket. Though I appreciated the gesture Id already made up my mind no sex. Why Because I dont want any more onenight stands. And because the foreplay was enough sensual intimate full of laughter and play and a little bit of dirty talk. At one point Seth whose profile asserted his love of oral sex asked if he could taste me. I begged off explaining that my underwear was going to remain on. I like that youre taking it slow he purred as he climbed on top of me moving and pushing his lower torso against mine up and down forward and backward. I was sad when Seth said goodbye a few hours later. I could have gone on kissing and moving against him for hours. Up until that point my Feeld experiences had been less about making love than fucking. Which has its own appeal But that night with Seth was a reminder of the real and deep delights of intimacy and sensuality and eroticism. Of human connection. Seth wasnt the first man with whom Ive had an intense positive interaction. A few weeks before him there was Roman an Eastern European musician and 30yearold whose profile talked up his talent with his fingers he played guitar and who surprised me by putting his hand though not very roughly on my neck as he fucked me. I really liked it. He spoke dirty to me in his sexy accent moved me around into different positions and complimented my skills in bed. He also kissed me and kissed me well. Not enough men do. Then there was Noah the first actual ageappropriate man 51 Ive been with since I got on the app. The divorced dad of a college student Noah and I texted on and off for a few weeks before making plans to meet outside a bar on a freezingcold night. We took one look at each other and hightailed it straight to his place. I was aware of the potential danger in meeting a man previously unknown to me and then following him into his apartment but I got a good feeling from Noah the moment we met in person and besides Id sent a screengrab of his profile and a link to his Instagram account to my friend just in case. Like Roman and Seth Noah was sexually generous and emotionally present sensual and skilled and responsive. Throughout the course of our conversation online hed explained that he had a couple of kinks and curiosities he wanted to try out and explore like getting pegged but he didnt press me on the issue and I didnt ask. I had told him Id consider it. Like the others he messaged me the next day to tell me what a lovely time hed had. Maybe I have a low bar but considering some of the experiences Ive had online I was pretty impressed. Alas Roman has now disappeared. He didnt respond to my last text message welcoming him back from a weekslong music tour in and around Europe. Perhaps hell come back around but Im not holding my breath. I suspect I was a curiosity for him a woman 19 years his senior with whom he could enact various dominant postures and positions like the light choking thing that to my surprise turned me on so much. Noah is around but moving to another city which is all but a guarantee that though I will probably see him again in the short term any sort of longterm friendswithbenefits scenario is impossible. As for Seth well hes gone too away for a month on a series of jobs hes a project manager for live events. I dont have much hope that once he gets back well see each other again. Hes been intermittently responsive to the one or two attempts Ive made at outreach and his initial keen interest both before and after we hooked up seems to have settled into well something different something more subdued. In truth despite these encounters Im a little disappointed. Im looking for a lover. Maybe multiple. And Id hoped that one of these initial interactions would lead to something more longlasting more reliable and consistent.

17,"Down 68% to 73% in 2022, Can the S&P 500's 3 Worst Stocks Recover in 2023?","After brutal declines this year, are these stocks doomed or poised for a rebound?",https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/12/27/down-68-to-73-can-sp-500s-3-worst-stocks-recover/,While it can be difficult to distinguish between deeply discounted stocks and falling knives it remains a tempting area for investors to focus on when hunting for stocks. Consider Match Group MTCH 0. 15 Generac Holdings GNRC 0. 10 and Align Technology ALGN 1. 77 which are all down at least 68 year to date. They also have the unenviable distinction of being the three worst performers in the SP 500 this year. Now may be the perfect time for investors to see if shortterm worries have started to outweigh longterm opportunities in these oncepromising companies. 1. Match Group Dating app behemoth Match Group rose over 50 during the height of the pandemic in 2020 riding the strength of its popular Tinder app and match. com website. However following decelerating growth the departure of Tinders CEO after less than a year and a 441 million settlement with Tinders founders the market decided to reel in Matchs premium valuation. The stock is down 67 in 2022 alone and the company recently eked out 1 revenue growth compared to last years third quarter 10 without foreign exchange impacts on 2 paying customer growth over the same time frame. Despite this slowdown Match is a genuine cash cow generating over 800 million in free cash flow FCF annually since 2018. So far in 2022 it has earned 262 million in FCF despite the 441 million settlement staying in line with this incredible cash creation. Also in addition to its core Tinder app providing 16 sales growth on a foreign exchangeneutral basis its Hinge app is rapidly being adopted by Gen Z users and is set to benefit from localized product rollouts across Europe. Best yet with a market capitalization of roughly 12 billion Match group trades at 15 times the 800 million in FCF it has averaged annually over the last three years. While brighter days are likely ahead for Match its Tinder CEO spot is still vacant. Furthermore Hinge needs to prove it can be a force internationally so interested investors would be wise to slowly dollarcost average into a position over time. 2. Generac Generac offers power supply reliability in numerous forms whether it be home standby generators portable units and clean energy storage in its residential segment or heavyduty solutions in the commercial and industrial unit. While this may not sound like an exciting growth industry Generac has seen its sales and earnings per share EPS rise by 289 and 364 respectively over the last decade. Better yet over the same time the company has seen its return on invested capital ROIC grow from around 7 to 19 demonstrating improving profitability of its investments compared to its debt and equity. A high and rising ROIC has proven to be a great indicator of a stocks potential to outperform and Generac ranks in the top quartile of the SP 500 index when sorted by highest ROIC. The companys energy solutions seem poised to generate outsize share price returns. So why is the stock down 73 year to date Generac shares historically traded with an enterprise value of around 12 to 15 times earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization EBITDA however that ratio ballooned to over 40 in 2021 as revenue spiked by more than 50 during the year. From this lofty valuation Generac stock sold off harshly as the home standby generator market slowed leaving the companys sales to grow by only 15 year over year in its most recent quarter. However management believes this market will gradually rebound in 2023. Better yet its clean energy commercial and industrial segments should experience substantial growth buoyed by megatrends in their niches such as the rapid uptake of electric vehicles. The stock is now trading at its lowest EVtoEBITDA ratio in the last decade and curious investors could dollarcost average into a starter position with Generac and let the companys performance compound returns over the long haul. 3. Align Technology Despite facing a staggering 70 drop in 2022 Align Technology shares have risen sevenfold in the past decade thanks to the continued success of the companys Invisalign clear aligners. Helping spur this drop were incredibly tough stimulusaided comparable figures from 2021 and patent expirations around some of Invisaligns core technologies. This has opened the company up to competition from generic sources and will test its ability to rely on branding to maintain its oncestrong pricing power. With sales declining 12 year over year during the third quarter it may feel like the investment thesis in Align is beginning to fall apart. However it is vital for investors to zoom out just a bit and remember that despite the companys struggles in 2022 its revenue and cash from operations have increased regardless of volatility over the last five years. Even with this recent decline in its cash from operations Align trades well below its average pricetooperatingcashflow ratio of 34 over the last decade. The company registered its 14 millionth Invisalign patient in Q3 and believes over 500 million people globally could benefit from its aligners and retainers offering a compelling growth runway for investors. With less than 50 of sales coming from international markets Aligns worldwide growth story is still in its infancy especially if it can effectively fight competition from cheaper generic versions of its products. While the target market for Aligns products is massive its valuation is still a bit rich for a consumer discretionary business facing negative growth rates recently. While these declines could be temporary Aligns increased competition makes it look more like a falling knife right now so investors may want to see a return to growth before buying.,No Headline,Extremely Negative,190,-,-,-

A University of York spokesperson said in November We are aware of eggs being thrown and are appalled by the images reported by the media today. As a community built on the values of respect and decency the University condemns such behaviour and we will be reviewing the incident in line with our misconduct procedures. Nick Price head of the CPS special crime and counter terrorism division said in December The CPS has authorised North Yorkshire Police to charge Patrick Thelwell with threatening behaviour contrary to Section 4 of the Public Order Act 1986. This follows an investigation by police into an incident in which eggs were thrown at HM The King in York on November 9 2022.

21,Vizio’s M-Series Sound Bar Turned My Apartment Into a Movie Theater,Want to feel like you’re scaling Mount Doom or racing against Vin Diesel? Get this affordable but surprisingly powerful speaker set.,https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvm49w/vizio-m-series-sound-bar-review,I remember the first flat screen TV my family got. It was in the late 2000s when nice TVsaka TVs with fancy remotes onscreen guides and slimmer profileswere becoming ubiquitous. At the time I was obsessed with the Sony Bravia bouncyball commercial soundtracked by Jose Gonzalezs Heartbeatsit had basically become part of my personality thank god Tinder didnt exist then. I started to believe that in order to have real beauty in my life I needed superior electronics. When the Great TV Wave finally hit my family I went to Walmart with my dad and we ended up picking up a nascent modestly sized Vizio flat screen. At the time I thought it was the sickest TV ever but as more and more of my friends picked up better tubes from Samsung Sony Hisense and Phillips I started to feel the Vizio was a cheap subpar alternative to brands that represented The Good Stuff. This is all to say that Ive had an emotional bias against Vizio for a long time. I know Im not alone Im now a Vizio apologistdefender as Ill get into below and almost every time I tout the brand to people theyre shocked. If we were playing a word association game a year ago and you said Vizio I would have said garbage. But I no longer believe any of this. The new Vizio MSeries 2. 1 sound bar has changed my perception of the entire brand. Recently I had a week off work and made it my goal to do two things rewatch all three Lord of the Rings movies and finally start playing Elden Ring on my Playstation 5 I dubbed it Ring Week. It had long been on my apartment todo list to pick up a sound bar for my TV a TCL 5Series that I really like which has a great picture but subpar speakers as most factory TVs do. I knew that to reach multimedia paradise it was time for an upgrade. I set out first to find an allinone sound bar since my living room isnt humongous and surround sound wasnt a priority of mine. After surveying the singlepiece sound bars I found that some of Vizios models are actually quite beloved like this toprated Vizio MSeries with over 2000 reviews. Ultimately however I decided that I deserved a subwoofer and that I didnt care if my downstairs neighbor had to listen to a deafening runthrough of The Two Towers iconic Battle of Helms Deep. I knew I wanted 2. 1 channels Dolby Atmos a wireless subwoofer and something that would pair well with 4K HDR since Ive been waiting for the right time to watch my Criterion Collection 4K UHD copies of Lost Highway and Raging Bull. Id already watched a 4K UHD transfer of The Last Waltz which looked absolutely unreallike otherworldly but I unfortunately experienced it through my TCLs mediocre speakers crying face emoji. After scouring the internet for opinions and reviews and taking into account a lot of user comments on Amazon I came to accept that Vizio is actually one of the most respected sound bar brands for under 400. The internet seems pretty confident that if youre shopping over that price range the Sonos Arc and Sonos Beam reign supreme. So for 300 smackers The Vizio MSeries 2. 1 sound bar seemed like the best option to me. And since thats the price of seeing the new Avatar movie in IMAX about 10 times it felt justified. The equipment couldnt have been easier to put togetherI just connected the main sound bar to the HDMI to the TV and hooked up the power. For the subwoofer I figured it would be pretty complicated to set up since it was wireless instead I literally turned it on and it paired immediately and Ive never had to think about it since. I wondered if syncing the sound bar to my TV would be a pain in the ass but it quickly recognized it and paired and now I barely even have to use the remote that came with the sound bar except to switch between Movie and Game modes. The experience of watching TV and playing games with the sound bar is amazing especially if youve never owned a good sound bar. Within minutes of starting The Fellowship of the Ring I was floored by the depth of bass and general fullness of sound the speaker and subwoofer brought into my apartment. I felt like I was at the movies watching Sauron hammer people mercilessly and literally sensing the vibrations in my body. Later on while screening Return of the King as Sam and Frodo scaled Mount Doom it felt like lava flowed around me as I too struggled to ward off the grip of evil. Watching a Fast and Furious movie as I give this piece a final read I briefly questioned whether Ill ever even go to the movies again. Spoiler alert I definitely will. But this bad boy isnt only good for action. Im also rewatching Friday Night Lights for the sixth or eighth time dont hate and the Vizio makes even the quiet moments feel immersive. Case in point In one scene characters are eating at a diner having a conversation as music plays in the background. Not yet used to the sound bar I literally paused the show thinking someone was playing music outside my apartment in the street of course I realized that the bar and subwoofer just made it sound like music was coming from a different part of the room. Amazing moment. TLDR The Vizio MSeries 2. 1 sound bar isnt just proof that an affordable sound bar can be mindblowingly goodits proof that people can change. While I went into 2022 thinking that Vizio was a wack brand that should be avoided at all costs I exited the year feeling like scoring one of its sound bars was among the best things Id ever done for myself. Literally everything sounds better on this thing even talk show clips on YouTube. If you do one nice thing for yourself in 2023 and you dont already have a sound bar or have a bad one pick up the Vizio MSeries 2. 1. On my end I reckon its time to revisit The Hobbit so if you need me I wont be available for the next nine hours MGM Lion roar. The Vizio MSeries 2. 1 sound bar is available on Amazon.

22,"The Moneyist: ‘I want to meet someone rich. Is that so wrong?’ I’m 46, earn $210,000, own a $700,000 home. I’m tired of dating losers.",‘I see wealth as a sign that someone is ambitious and aims high.’,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/i-want-to-meet-someone-rich-is-that-so-wrong-im-46-earn-210-000-own-a-700-000-home-im-tired-of-dating-losers-11671690192,Dear Quentin Ive reached the point in my life where I want to settle down but I recently had a disagreement with a friend about my priorities and I would appreciate your perspective. Im 46 a collegeeducated singleton and earn 210000 not including my annual bonus. I have paid off my student loans and own my home. Its worth about 700000 and theres about 400000 left on the mortgage. Heres my issue I want to meet someone rich. Is that so wrong My friend expressed dismay when I told her that but I see wealth as a sign that someone is ambitious and aims high. Im sick of dating losers. The last person I dated had been living in the same rentcontrolled apartment for nearly 20 years. Its the size of my dining room. I know living in a rentcontrolled apartment is something that is sought after in a city like Los Angeles and its environs. Maybe that was good when he was 20. But hes now nearly 50. Am I being too judgmental When I expressed my feelings about limiting my search to dating a wealthy man my friend gave me a look and took a long slow drink of her margarita. That was her way of showing disapproval. But I have worked hard to have what I have and I dont see anything wrong with wanting a partner who has the same level of assets and ambition as I have. I work as an interior designer and my business continues to grow. P. S. I come from an uppermiddleclass family one that has always worked for what they have. My parents were both successful Realtors. Single for the Holidays Dear Single If you objectify someone for earning less than your annual salary be prepared for an even wealthier person to do the same to you. There are many people who earn a quarter of what you earn who would rightly see themselves as winners. The median household income in the U. S. hovers at around 71000 a year. Better to regard your own income as a gift rather than a barometer by which to measure or judge others. Theres a big difference between wanting to date a guy who is wealthy andor has a job and is financially independent and describing someone you dated as a loser. Its possible that your friend quietly rolled her eyes at that. Perceptions of what constitutes wealthy are relative. The first suggests you believe you are owed the same yield on your relationship as you have earned andor inherited from your parents in your own lifetime. That inheritance may include an education that enabled you to go to college andor money inherited from your parents. The second implies anyone who has not had the same opportunities as you or has not chosen a job that pays as well such as a teacher nurse or social worker some of the most important professions in the world is not up to par. Neither of these positions sit well with me. Nearly half of people who are dating said in this survey that financial transparency makes them more comfortable early on in the relationship. In other words money matters. And yet more than a third of people have hidden debt from their partner. Translation They know money matters. That said using wealth as the one filter for your search for a life partner could limit your choices and put the desire for material things or a certain lifestyle above other important criteria humility kindness intelligence compassion etc. They dont have Instagram META Baby boomers are expected to transfer up to 68 trillion in wealth to younger generations over the next 20 years according to one projection by the Investment Company Institute a global association of regulated funds. That would be the biggest intergenerational transfer in history. Some of that wealth will be in the form of property. The world is not built equitably or fairly. Black homeownership hovers at around 45 according to one recent estimate while the white homeownership rate is closer to 75. Against the backdrop of redlining the 2008 housing crisis and other structural barriers Black Americans are also far more likely than their white counterparts to be rejected for mortgages. Using wealth as the one filter for your search for a life partner could limit your choices and put the desire for material things or a certain lifestyle above other important criteria. Before we congratulate ourselves on where we have ended up in life its important to take a reality check about where we started. You want to find a life partner who has a similar or larger bank balance to you. They may or may not share your outlook on life financial goals regardless of their net wealth or income or have similar views on rich vs. poor. Most people are just lucky to own their own home. The median income needed to buy a typical home in the U. S. has risen to 88300 nearly 40000 more than it was before the start of the pandemic Lawrence Yun chief economist at the National Association of Realtors said last month. Silicon Valleys commercialization of peoples personal lives the lucrative crossroads of finance and romance which results in people swiping left or right on a carousel of images has brought new meaning to the dating market.

Musk stock slips Below META as Worries About Demand Intensify...",https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/elon-musk-behaving-like-the-28891606,Tech billionaire Elon Musk has been labelled the richest troll on Earth by a top gun safety advocate. Since Musk took over Twitter in a 37 billion deal last year he has allegedly allowed controversial posts to run riot on the platform under the guise of free speech. And the Tesla founder has even posted some of his own shocking thoughts and personal images on the site. READ MORE Top porn star shocked after getting just seven likes on Tinder during love search One of which was of his bedside table featuring a can of coke and an unlocked gun which looked real at the time but later turned out not to be. This image has been slammed by Fred Guttenberg whose daughter Jamie was murdered during the deadly Parkland School shooting in 2018. Seventeen people died during the shocking incident and shooter Nikolas Cruz was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole. Speaking about Musks image and tweet Guttenberg told Bloomberg Quicktakes Emma Barnett during an interview It actually doesnt matter whether it the gun was real or not because the message is what matters. Its so strange now watching what Elon Musk is turning himself into. He is a business person who I was so mesmerized by for so many years who I thought did the coolest things. If he had a vision I automatically thought that if Elon Musk things he can pull it off Ill be you he can. I looked at him that way until his pursuit of Twitter and what he has turned it into which is a cesspool of indecency and the worst of humanity. Why hes behaving like the richest troll on Earth instead of this successful business person that he had previously been I cant make sense of but I hope he fails. Musks controversial tweet is still up and has amassed 891k likes and more than 57k retweets.

24,Fishnets and Tinder: Women MPs reveal toxic sexism in Westminster,"As research highlights the shocking ‘exclusionary’ culture in parliament, female MPs tell Maya Oppenheim their stories",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sexism-westminster-sexual-harassment-bullying-b2258902.html,Fishnets and Tinder Women MPs reveal toxic sexism in Westminster As research highlights the shocking exclusionary culture in parliament female MPs tell Maya Oppenheim their stories Seven in ten women MPs have witnessed sexist conduct in parliament in the past five years according to research that highlights an exclusionary and toxic culture in Westminster. Gender equality charity The Fawcett Society spoke to MPs about their experiences of misogyny in parliament and found that while only about half of male MPs said they had witnessed sexism the figure for female politicians was 69 per cent. The report follows a storm of bullying and sexual harassment allegations which have rocked Westminster prompting a number of MPs to be investigated suspended or to step down from their roles. Around threequarters of women MPs said they chose not to voice their views on some topics on social media due to their fears of experiencing harassment online in comparison to around half of male MPs. Researchers discovered just four in 10 women MPs thought parliaments working culture was inclusive for people like me as they warned the problems unveiled in the study would compound the shortage of women in Westminster with Black minoritised and disabled women hardest hit. A female MP who did not want to be named said My kid came home and said Mum why do so many people hate on you. And youve got to externally put on a really really brave face and a fighter face and internally it breaks you. Six women MPs from the Conservatives Labour and Liberal Democrats told The Independent about of their experiences. Labours Dawn Butler said she had endured sexualised comments for wearing fishnet tights while the Conservative Partys Caroline Nokes said she had been touched inappropriately and a minister told her she was only appointed because she has ts. Dawn Butler There was one incident when I wore plain fishnets to parliament. I received so many overly sexual misogynistic comments that I took the tights off and threw them in the bin and never wore fishnets again. I spoke to a more senior female MP. She told me to ignore it saying its all banter. She told equivalent stories women MPs have been through. There were lots of stories of MPs looking up their skirt. The parliamentary environment needs to change. New procedures are vital and important. MPs that have been in parliament for a long time have put up with a lot of sexism. The good thing is now postMe Too movement we are not putting up with it. Some of the men have not moved forward. They still think it is acceptable to be sexist and misogynistic. When I was a whip an MP was talking about me having a real whip in the tea room in parliament. It happened more than once. It became very uncomfortable and embarrassing for me. Parliament was designed for men only and there is still that prevailing attitude that this is a mans place and the women are just window dressing and there is that entitlement to belittle women. All you have to do is hang out in the bar let alone what goes in the chamber such as sometimes the patronising way that women are spoken to. Caroline Nokes I have experienced sexual harassment in Westminster. Over the past 12 years a lot of it I have shrugged off and have done nothing about it. Some incidents I reported to the whips. The stark reality is we dont yet have a system in place. We need the individual political parties cooperating with each other drawing up policies and protocols. There have been a number of incidents where I have been touched inappropriately and inappropriate suggestions were made to me and about me. I dont want to name names. I dont have confidence the systems are in place in parliament that enable it to be dealt with correctly. I remember a minister told me to my face I was only appointed because I have ts. The thing that shocked me is if they are saying that to your face God knows what are they saying behind your back. The reality is that nobody wants to talk about the lowlevel microaggression they are only interested in the horrific tales of women being pinned against the wall by someone. They want to focus on disgusting blatant stories of sexual harassment. This is a really tough place for women to work who contend with inappropriate demeaning belittling comments from colleagues who think they are being funny. They think it is okay to bully and demean women. Nadia Whittome Quite regularly male MPs talk to my chest instead of my face. It makes me feel really uncomfortable. Presumably they can tell I feel uncomfortable. When I was 19 I briefly worked in parliament. I very much looked like a teenager. A very senior Tory backbencher said I bet you are on Tinder arent you and was asking me about my dating life. I was in an enclosed space with him I couldnt get away. He thought could get away with it more because I was an intern. I feel hyperconscious of what I am wearing to work. Men in their fifties and sixties will often have lingering eyes and then comment on what you are wearing. They are clearly not saying that because they have got some great interest in clothes. I feel out of place in parliament. It feels uncomfortable often. I often think oh god is my skirt riding up does my top look low with the camera and you are seeing all these smirking leering faces opposite you. A lot of them are a lot older than my nan. I dont go in the bars much. A lot of the male MPs staff and journalists are found there. It is almost like The Thick Of It cosplay. It feels like parliament is full of a class and gender of people who have solidarity with each other. Things are so much worse if you are a woman of colour. Kate Osamor Parliament is a very masculine environment. It is a shouty environment it is very loud it is not a comfortable workplace. I dont come from a wealthy upperclass background. It is the majority white men who have the upper hand. I havent got anything in common with the majority of the MPs. The culture is to go to the bar listen talk gossip and drink alcohol. A lot of MPs dont go home to their family. Their family may be in a constituency which could be miles away. The culture at Westminster is unhealthy. Its workaholic it is constant. It is unhealthy there is no degree of separation. The bar is essentially an extension of the chamber. I go to work and come home. It doesnt mean it is a good thing. I do it to protect myself. I want women who are not politicians who are looking in from outside whether they are Black or working class to be welcome. But they will not be in a place where people watch porn or women are sexually harassed or assaulted on the estate. We need parliament to be diverse we need it to represent people. Layla Moran I have had inappropriate overtures by men in power in the Lib Dem party. In one case a hand on my leg inappropriately on a campaigning training weekend. It was very inappropriate. It was a squeeze on the top of the calve. Young women are put in these situations in politics where they are finding their feet. There are predatory men in all parties who take advantage of that position. In 2007 I was in my late twenties. I was at party conference and there was this MP in his forties or fifties who was buying me and my friend drinks all night and then kept trying to meet up with us at the conference. Afterwards he sent us emails saying something along the lines lets have a drink and I will help you get ahead in the party and help you with your career. The Me Too movement was really pivotal across politics. The wider point to make is politics in general still has an issue. It is definitely getting better but we have far more to do to get to the point we need to be. Jess Phillips You get lowlevel sexism all the time. Ive defended other women in the chamber. I know women who work for me certainly Black women have found Westminster to be oppressive. Lots of men shush me because Im quite rowdy. I get lots of comments like calm down the honourable lady acts with her heart. In the postMe Too world you get joking comments like am I allowed to ask you to pass the milk or I dont know if Im allowed to say this to me but you look lovely. Its like of course you are allowed to say that to me you p. Quite a lot of Tory men treat me like Im some sort of exotic bird. People act like Im either a pain or something to be marvelled at. You can see sometimes in meetings women are asked to do things like get the tea. The expectation of them being stupid and annoying is quite common that is very irritating. There is a power imbalance there is an element of impunity.

The video was posted by user Nicole nicolekcaruso who took to the videosharing platform to share her experience of receiving messages from her guy friends teasing her about using the dating app. nicolekcaruso i am just praying that theyre messing w me and this isnt real which is honestly a possibility. regardless im deleting tinder IMMEDIATELY. original sound Nicole I dont know who authorized this update this feature I get a simultaneous text from two of my guy friends that say Why are you swiping on Tinder at 11 am and immediately Im like how did you know that Nicole says in the video. Like none of the guys that I swiped on even looked familiar. Its not like they couldve been mutual friends. Confused Nicole asked how they knew about her activity on the app. Thats when she learned that Instagram had allegedly sent out a notification to her followers saying Nicole is swiping on Tinder. In the video she expressed her frustration with the alleged feature. I have relatives cousins uncles people who just do not need to be knowing I am swiping on Tinder she says. Like no one needs to know that information. At this time it is unclear whether Instagram indeed shared information about Nicoles activity on Tinder or if her friends were joking with her.

While Tinder users can link their Instagram accounts to their dating app profiles Tinder has not announced an update that shares account activity across social media platforms.

28,Amateur astronomers 'swipe right' to hunt dark energy and ID nearly a quarter million galaxies,"Astronomers drafted 10,000 volunteers from across the globe to assist in a monumental massive ""Dark Energy Explorers"" galaxy-mapping mission.",https://www.space.com/amateurs-swipe-right-galaxy-cosmic-tinder-project,An ambitious galaxymapping mission has identified around 250000 galaxies in the quest to better understand dark energy the mysterious force that is causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. The results delivered by the HobbyEberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment HETDEX based at The University of Texas at Austins McDonald Observatory would not have been possible without the aid of over 10000 amateur astronomers to help in its quest. The volunteers contribute online to a project called Dark Energy Explorers with little more than a smartphone or a computer swiping right to differentiate an actual galaxy This allows them to explore the mysteries of the universe alongside astronomers while assisting in the hunt for distant galaxies and ultimately helping them learn more about dark energy. The ultimate goal of the project is to build the most extensive 3D map of the cosmos focusing on galaxies in the early universe to measure rates of expansion and thus find clues about the mysterious force of dark energy. The operators of the HETDEX project opens in new tab hope to scale up the project which began in February 2021 with the drafting of more amateur scientists. This is because the 247000 galaxies the survey has thus far identified represent just onetenth of the total number of galaxies it is projected to uncover in the patch of sky it examines which is equivalent in size to around 2000 full moons. Thats why we need more people UT Austin professor of astronomy HETDEX principal investigator Karl Gebhardt said in a statement opens in new tab. If we can get to 100000 people volunteering which I think is doable across the world then were there in the next year. Volunteers swipe right on a cosmic Tinder The Dark Energy Explorers volunteers make use of the Zooniverse platform opens in new tab Following a short tutorial the new Dark Energy Explorers view astronomical images and select if what they see represents a nearby galaxy or a distant and thus ancient one. They then embark on a separate workflow in which they decide if an image features a galaxy or simply random noise. The Dark Energy Explorer volunteers are thus often the first humans to lay eyes on a newly discovered galaxy. The amateur scientists then swipe right on the images they believe are galaxies like a cosmic version of Tinder. Its really exciting to see how enthusiastic the public is about classifying these galaxies said project leader Lindsay House a University of Texas Austin graduate student. Dark energy is believed to account for around 70 of the universes total energy and matter but still scientists know very little about what it is beyond its effect of accelerating the expansion of the universe. Studying the way ancient galaxies race apart from each other could help better understand the dynamics of dark energy and this is a vital step in determining what it is and where it comes from. In order to do this and to catch a glimpse of dark energy at work however astronomers need a massive sample of distant galaxies to study. Operating with the 11meter HobbyEberly Telescope at the McDonald Observatory in West Texas this gigantic catalog of ancient galaxies is exactly what HETDEX aims to build. The Dark Energy Explorers program is key in this allowing amateur scientists to reduce the time astronomers spend identifying galaxies by 90 letting them instead focus on more difficult identifications. Volunteers are necessary for the project because humans have proved much better at making the distinction between galaxies and noise than even sophisticated computer programs. Weve tried writing computer code to do this and even used machine learning but we found the human eye is significantly superior Gebhardt said. We were skeptical at first but we were blown away by the accuracy. Thus far identifying these near quartermillion galaxies has required almost 4 million swipes from volunteers. This is because each candidate galaxy is reviewed by 15 people who must reach a consensus thus improving the accuracy of the process. The teams research is detailed in the Dec. 1 edition of the journal Nature.

The post What Can We Expect For Social…",https://socialmediaexplorer.com/content-sections/news-and-noise/what-can-we-expect-for-social-media-in-2023-big-changes-say-the-pundits/,Although it is unlikely that anyone would have predicted Elon Musk becoming the owner of Twitter one year ago they did eventually find someone to take over. It was a great year for social media in 2022. Donald Trump launched Truth Social and there were new calls to ban TikTok. A Twitter alternative wasnt yet available. There could be more social media disruptions in 2023. However it is likely that younger users will still use these platforms. Wendy Mei from Playsee Head of Product and Strategy at the social media platform Playsee said that Gen Z would continue to influence the social media landscape. Their desire to authenticity will drive major transformative changes in the industry Wendy Mei stated. There could be new services Gen Z users of social media will continue to desire accurate representations and will therefore gravitate toward authentic and lesscurated content. Old platforms that are so entrenched with unrealistically perfect ideologies will be unable to satisfy this generation the measurable shift in preferences has and will continue to lead to a significant discontent among some of the major players in the space creating room for new platforms that promote authenticity added Mei. As with every industry platforms will fail to survive the year. Its our job to make sure that they dont. Mei suggests that users could find ways to incorporate social media in their daily lives to fulfill their desire to be connected and feel part of their community. The downward spiral of Twitter will continue Elon Musk appears to already feel a touch of buyers remorse about his 44 million acquisition of Twitter. The social media platforms policies are not likely to benefit it. At least not for the near term. Charles King a technology analyst at PundIT said that Twitters downward spiral will not stop as long Elon Musk continues to engage with critics and stay in the public eye. It is also possible that Twitter may try to engage a known partner or partners in order to improve troubled areas of its business including its advertising agency. Twitter could be overthrown. Rob Enderle from the Enderle Group technology analyst said that Musks mismanagement and the increasing number of more viable competitions should make MySpace a solid category in yearend. Meta Problems Twitter is not the only social media platform that wants to overcome the challenges it encountered in 2022. Many at Facebook parent Meta want to get past the problems of last year. However it is still unclear how that will be achieved. Enderle observed that The Metaverse social networking experiment will continue failing until technology meets expectations which is likely to be towards the end the decade. King said that rumors that Meta will be split into two companies one on Facebook and one on the metaverse was likely true. While this should please large institutional investors and shareholders it will not help Mark Zs vision for the commercial metaverse get traction. Is TikTok going to be banned At this point it is more likely a matter of when not if the Chineseowned TikTok will see a widespread ban in the United States. Already several states have already banned videosharing apps on their government devices. And just last week the House of Representatives also ban it from its employees phones. The company might still be able to perform well for the shortterm. Lon Safko a tech entrepreneur and author of The TikTok said TikTok will continue to see growth in membership. Social Media Bible. Its amazing to me Vine didnt succeed but TikTok took off like wildfire. When you consider that the average human attention span is now less than that of a fish theshort form video method of communication has been effective. YouTube has their own TikTok style shortform video. TikTok may therefore continue to tick. King stated that the ban on TikTok in U. S. phones as well as other stateowned devices is unlikely to reduce its popularity with young people. Their users havent been affected by the other known dangers that social media platforms pose such as false information spreading and providing conduits for extremist speech. Influence could be lost 2022 may have been the last big year for influencers even as nearly a quarter of GenZ said in a survey last year that their ideal job would be an influencer. It is unlikely that the market will support this so those who dont succeed are more likely to be distracted by those who do. Safko stated that Influencer Marketing has been more challenging in 2022 due to the number of people trying become influencers. Their desire to promote other products through successful influencers is almost nonexistent. In addition almost all social media platforms are now at saturation. They will need to be supported in order to preserve shareholder value. Safko stated that all of them are under constant threat from their Board of Director to increase membership while revenue is falling. While social media will be used it will require a tremendous amount of money and effort to achieve marginal results. Bluebirds will always exist but people will influence more accidentally than intentionally. The Old Problems will Remain It is generally agreed that 2023 will see a lot of changes even though the nation continues to be divided. Platforms will be an easy somewhat secure political target when we get into the next round of elections. AI will appear more frequently in this sector unfortunately most will focus on scamming customers but some will improve moderation and increase engagement Enderle said. This doesnt mean that everything is going to change in the coming year. It is likely that some of the things that worked in the past will continue to work. Safko stated that Hookup app popularity continues to rise in activity and popularity.
