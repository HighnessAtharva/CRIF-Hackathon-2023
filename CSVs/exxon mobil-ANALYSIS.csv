1,Russian oil exports crater by 54% in the first full week of the EU's embargo amid a shortage of tankers willing to carry cargoes,"Meanwhile, energy giants Exxon Mobil and Shell are avoiding hiring tankers that previously carried Russian oil.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/russian-oil-exports-plunge-energy-markets-europe-embargo-putin-economy-2022-12,Russian oil exports are collapsing following the onset of the EUs Russian seaborne crude embargo. In the first full week after the ban total exports dropped by 1. 86 million barrels a day or 54 per Bloomberg. Meanwhile energy giants like Shell and Exxon Mobil have stopped using ships that previously carried Russian cargoes. Since the European Union imposed its seaborne crude sanctions Russian oil exports have tumbled by more than half according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In the week that ended December 16 which marked the first full week after the ban set in total volumes coming out of Russia fell by 1. 86 million barrels a day or 54 to about 1. 6 million. The fourweek average also dropped to a new low for 2022. Signs also pointed to a a shortage of ship owners who were willing to transport Russian oil from an export facility in Asia the report said. However the data must be viewed cautiously as variables like weather and cargo scheduling can sway weekoverweek changes in flows. Still other evidence has emerged that the market for ships is tightening. US oil company Exxon Mobil is avoiding hiring oil tankers that used to carry Russian supplies according to Bloomberg. Global energy rival Shell has also made a similar move as the possibility of some Russian oil being left over in a tanker risks violating sanctions. While a dark fleet of tankers has been assembled to move Russian oil below the radar the oil majors are making it harder for those ships to eventually go back to moving nonRussian supplies. Staring December 5 the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea and blocked shipping and related financial services for companies transporting Russian oil. At the same time the EU and the G7 imposed a 60perbarrel price cap on Moscows crude. The aim is to stifle Moscows export revenue while still keeping Russian crude flowing on the market and preventing a supply shock that would spike prices. For buyers abiding by the cap some of the measures in the EU embargo are allowed such as insurance. For those that pay above 60 a barrel then they cannot access EU services for 90 days.,2022-12-20T16:32:47Z,Russian oil exports crater by 54% in the first full week of the EU's embargo amid a shortage of tankers willing to carry cargoes,Extremely Negative,480,"crude, crude, tumbled, fell, shortage, rival, risks, dark, crude, stifle, crude, shock",-,"lawsuit, lawsuit, harassment, lawsuit, lawsuit"
2,Tesla stock dive sends market cap of the green energy darling below oil giant Exxon Mobil's,"On Wednesday, Tesla's market cap was $436 billion compared to $445 billion for Exxon Mobil.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-market-cap-green-energy-oil-giant-exxon-valuation-2022-12,Teslas valuation is now less than Exxon Mobil amid the electricvehicle leaders worst stock slump ever. On Wednesday Teslas market cap was 436 billion compared to 445 billion for the oil giant. Tesla is now the SP 500s 12th most valuable firm measured by market capitalization after previously climbing as high as fifth. The record plunge in Tesla stock has brought the valuation of the electric car company below oil giant Exxon Mobils. The last time Tesla was worth less than Exxon was early 2020 before the COVID19 pandemic triggered a massive reversal of fortune has since come undone amid the global energy crisis Fed rate hikes and Elon Musks Twitter takeover. On Wednesday Teslas market cap was 436 billion compared to 445 billion for the oil giant. Tesla stock is enduring its worst selloff since it debuted in public markets in 2010. Year to date it has lost 61 while Exxon has soared 76 as energy prices jumped after Russia launched its war on Ukraine. Tesla which joined the SP 500 exactly two years ago is now the indexs 12th most valuable firm measured by market capitalization after previously climbing as high as fifth. Exxon is ranked ninth on the SP 500. Tesla has faced immense pressure all year on aggressive Fed rate hikes that have slammed tech stocks broadly and growth concerns in China. Analysts and investors have also warned Tesla could face more downward pressure as Musk remains preoccupied with his acquisition of Twitter a company where he is also CEO. Meanwhile Exxon recently posted record quarterly earnings and is lavishing a 50 billion stock buyback on investors. That comes two years after Exxon was kicked off the Dow Jones Industrial Average after almost a century and recorded its first annual loss as the pandemic sent oil prices crashing in early 2020.,2022-12-21T17:44:40Z,Tesla stock dive sends market cap of the green energy darling below oil giant Exxon Mobil's,Extremely Positive,100,"worst, slump, undone, crisis, worst, lost, aggressive, concerns, warned, loss, crashing",-,"Elon, Musks, Musk"

N on Wednesday signaled another strong operational profit of about 15. 4 billion in its fourth quarter pushing it toward a record take for all of 2022. The largest U. S. oil producer indicated in a securities filing a cooling from its massive profits from the prior quarters. But preliminary operational results confirmed 2022 was Exxons best financial year with profits of around 58 billion. Formal earnings are due on Jan. 31. Operational results from pumping oil and gas its largest business retreated about 2. 3 billion from the record 12. 4 billion in the third quarter as crude prices fell. The gasoline and diesel business delivered about 4. 9 billion of profit in the quarter as fuel prices also eased from summer highs. Chemical profits decreased to about 300 million while motor oils profits were unchanged at about 800 million. The about 15. 4 billion in operating profits excluding impairments indicates annual results will far exceed the record 45 billion Exxon posted in 2008 when oil prices peaked at 142 per barrel. The company posted backtoback record profits in the second and third quarters last year. These record profits might lead to fresh calls to levy windfall taxes in the U. S. In Europe Exxon is already legally battling the bloc against further taxes that the company says discourages investments. High international oil and natural gas prices last year generated record earnings among all oil majors. Exxon benefited the most after doubling down on oil during the pandemic as European rivals shifted to renewable energy projects. Its shares jumped 80 in 2022 outrunning rivals. Skyhigh oil prices that fueled gains for most of the year eased in the final quarter. Brent futures closed 2022 at 77. 17 a barrel after hitting nearly 140 a barrel in March. Global gas markets on the other hand ended 2022 with strong gains. U. S. gas futures jumped by more than 20.

8,Porsche?de???d????d??? synthetic gasoline factory comes online today in Chile,"The Haru Oni plant will scale up from 34,000 gallons to 14.5 million gallons by 2024.",https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/porsches-synthetic-gasoline-factory-comes-online-today-in-chile/,This week a Chilean startup called Highly Innovative Fuels officially opened its first synthetic gasoline production facility. HIF was created to run the new plant which is the result of a collaboration between the automaker Porsche Siemens Energy Exxon Mobil Enel Green Power the Chilean state energy company ENAP and Empresas Gasco. Initially the site will produce around 34000 gallons 130000 L a year scaling up to 14. 5 million gallons 55 million L a year by 2024 with plans to increase that tenfold to 145 million gallons 550 million L a year by 2026. The first gasoline produced by the plant was used to ceremonially fill a Porsche 911 a task performed by Chiles energy minister Diego Pardow. Yesterday we celebrated together with all the employees from HIF and our partners this historic moment said Barbara Frenkel Porsches board member for procurement. It was a very special evening because we are encountering something which is of course very important to us for our sustainability strategy but also as we see big potential in efuels for the decarbonization of the Earths climate. So the synthetic fuel we are producing here stemming from wind energy water and CO 2 is really a compelling idea she said. The site located in Punta Arenas in Southern Chile will use wind to power the processthe area sees high winds roughly 270 days a year and a wind turbine can expect to produce up to four times as much energy as one in Europe according to Frenkel. As you might expect the project has been in the works for some time now. In 2017 two engineers from Porsche on the one side and from AMEthis was the predecessor company of HIFcame into contact with the idea of establishing an efuel pilot plant here down in the southern part of Chile in Magellanes where there is a high wind load explained Michael Steiner Porsches board member for research and development. And from this we started to find partners who would like to join this compelling idea and we started with Exxon Mobil who had a process developedmethanol to gasand also with Siemens who is famous for electrolyzers. So getting electric energy into hydrogen and with these two partners we started to plan the pilot plant we will open today he said. As Steiner explained the efuel plant will use wind power to electrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is then combined with carbon captured from the air or industrial sources to synthesize methanol which in turn can then be converted into longer hydrocarbons to be used as fuel. The synthetic efuel is a direct dropin for pump gasoline and initially Porsche will take all the sites production and use it to run its onemake Porsche Supercup race series as well as using it to fuel vehicles at its Porsche Experience Centers around the world. These are locations where one can go and test different Porsches. HIF has longterm plans to build out 12 synthetic fuel plants worldwide including locations in the US and Australia with a goal of each site capturing 2 million metric tons of CO 2 per year. Without any doubt there are a lot of regions all around the world where you have potential of really highefficient windmills or photovoltaic or even hydropower to get green energy Steiner said. What might be a little bit more difficult is could you get green CO 2 in the same amount So starting you could always gain green CO 2 from biomass or other processes point sources but long term we have also to find better ways to directly capture CO 2 from ambient air. So this is still a technology that needs some more research and development Steiner said. The synthetic efuel wont be exactly cheapSteiner thinks at current prices it works out to around 8 per gallon 2L although that obviously doesnt include any taxes or duties which make up most of the price of fuel in most regions around the world. But its an important project given that more than 1. 3 billion combustion engine vehicles are operating on roads globally today and with the best will in the world those arent all going to be replaced by electric vehicles any time soon. We may even see some of the fuel end up in Formula 1. That sport has a goal of being carbon netzero by 2030 and in 2026 is switching to carbonneutral fuel. Although Porsches plans to enter F1 in 2026 as an engine manufacturer look to be in doubt its corporate sibling Audi will do so that year and its possible that team may source its sustainable fuel from HIF.,2022-12-20T15:09:43Z,Porsche?de???d????d??? synthetic gasoline factory comes online today in Chile,Extremely Positive,20,"doubt, difficult, doubt",-,"Diego, Pardow, Barbara, Frenkel, Porsches, Michael, Steiner, Porsches, Steiner, Steiner, Steiner, cheapSteiner"

S. President Joe Biden and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador failed to resolve a running energy dispute during two days of talks that ended on Tuesday. However the inquiry provides fresh insight into the administrations strategy to resolve the dispute with Mexico over its efforts to give priority treatment to cashstrapped state energy companies at the expense of private outside investors. The State Department sent an email to U. S. energy companies last week asking them how many permits and applications they had applied for in Mexico over the past three years identify which ones were denied and list any projects shelved due to the permitting challenges. The query shows the Biden administration was looking to arm itself with details it could use in talks with Mexico as it seeks to demonstrate the country is flouting a regional trade agreement and potentially stunting its own economic growth in the process. Officials at the State Department and the American Petroleum Institute the U. S. oil industrys main trade group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lopez Obrador has moved aggressively to redraw energy sector rules for the benefit of state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos Pemex and public power utility Comision Federal de Electricidad CFE arguing past governments skewed the market in favor of private capital. Oil and gas companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp XOM. N Valero Energy Corp VLO. N and Marathon Petroleum Corp MPC.
