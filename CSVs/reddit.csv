Its so unfortunate then that the franchises creator author J. K. Rowling has repeatedly proven herself to be the worst kind of antitransgender bigot. That bigotry is in the spotlight once again as the bigticket Harry Potter game Hogwarts Legacy is due out soon. Its also likely why the popular leftleaning subreddit rGamingCircleJerk basically just exploded in anti Hogwarts Legacy sentiment. As its name suggests rGamingCircleJerk is a circlejerk subreddit meant to be a tongueincheek riff on rGaming. Most posts are jokes but the occasional unjerk posts are sincere as was the case last Wednesday when moderator GrizzlyPeak72 posted a photo of Rowling and the games cover along with the text A friendly reminder from your modteam that this woman is a TERF and anyone who pledges to support her monetarily is also a transphobe. That post alone elicited over 3700 comments and it was just the start. TERF of course is the abbreviation for transexclusionary radical feminist which refers to selfidentified feminists who when you get down to it more or less oppose trans peoples right to exist in society. Rowlings history of transphobic comments can be easily researched online and I wont repeat them here. Suffice it to say its not a stretch to describe her as a TERF. Discussion of the post and the wider mentality underlying it spread through Reddit and across social media. Some voices protested claiming that supporting Hogwarts Legacy didnt mean supporting Rowlings beliefs. Others said it does in fact as buying the game supports the bigoted author monetarily. Some commenters brought up the questionable parts of the Potter canon itself. And yet others somehow seem to still believe Rowling isnt a TERF at all despite her openly repeating TERF ideology. Vertagear 800 Series Gaming Chair Ergonomic comfort Adjustable seat height neck support memory foam pillow adjustable back rest and tilt locking system and 4D armrests that move in 4 directions to fit you best. Many members of the GamingCircleJerk subreddit have shown support for mod GrizzlyPeak72s initial post in both joking and serious ways which is unsurprising as the group often mocks the closedminded antigay antiwomen antitrans views that unfortunately still proliferate in gaming communities. GrizzlyPeak72 who posted the initial unjerk said more than 1000 transphobes have been banned from the subreddit since their post last week. There are also plenty of people who have said they still plan to play the game after pirating it. And even some in the Harry Potter subreddit have expressed concerns about the game both because of its content and the creators views. But ultimately this is welltrod ground as grief over Rowlings worldview stretches back to the original books themselves. There has long been criticism of the series stereotypical portrayals of nonwhite characters when they exist at all its messy allegories for racial and social injustice and its arguably racist and antisemitic depictions of house elves and goblins. In the Harry Potter canon the goblins repeatedly rebel because they face discrimination. Unfortunately for wouldbe defenders of Hogwarts Legacy the plot description for the openworld action RPG game as we know it so far involves your character quelling a goblin rebellion that is aligned with dark wizards which raises the possibility that youll effectively be filling the role of a magical cop keeping down those who are fighting for a more just and equitable society. Its also concerning that the former lead designer of Hogwarts Legacy was an altright Gamergate troll. Combined the entire Harry Potter franchise is being reexamined as people reckon with the idea that maybe one of their childhood favorites isnt as great as they remember and struggle to determine whether they can separate the art from the artist especially one who continues to profit handsomely from said art. Hogwarts Legacy tells players Your legacy is what you make of it. Thats probably the best thing to keep in mind when weighing whether or not to pick up the game.
1,"Bill Gates is meh on Web 3 and the metaverse, but bullish on AI","The Microsoft cofounder was giving his take on the tech trends at his annual Ask Me Anything session on Reddit, where he answered a handful of questions posed by Reddit users on a variety of subjects.",https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-reddit-ama-ai-not-metaverse-revolutionary-chatgpt-2023-1,Bill Gates is meh on Web 3 and the metaverse but bullish on AI Bill Gates said artificial intelligence is quite revolutionary in his annual Reddit AMA session. In contrast the Microsoft cofounder appeared lukewarm about Web3 and the metaverse. Bill Gates has weighed in on some of the buzziest concepts in tech revealing hes tepid about Web3 and the metaverse but thinks artificial intelligence or AI is quite revolutionary. The Microsoft cofounder was giving his take on tech trends at his annual Ask Me Anything session on Reddit where he answered a handful of questions posed by Reddit users on a variety of subjects. One Reddit user asked Many years ago I think around 2000 I heard you say something on TV like People are vastly overestimating what the internet will be like in 5 years and vastly underestimating what it will be like in 10 years. Is any mammoth technology shift at a similar stage right now Gates replied AI is the big one. I dont think Web3 was that big or that metaverse stuff alone was revolutionary but AI is quite revolutionary. Gates appeared particularly keen about generative AI that is artificial intelligence that can create content saying I am quite impressed with the rate of improvement in these AIs. I think they will have a huge impact. Gates was responding to a Reddit user who asked for his views on generative AI and how he thinks it will impact he world. Thinking of it in the Gates Foundation context we want to have tutors that help kids learn math and stay interested. We want medical help for people in Africa who cant access a Doctor Gates added. I still work with Microsoft some so I am following this very closely. Gates was also asked about what he thought about the hugely popular ChatGPT platform which has been making waves recently as its able to generate written humanlike text. It gives a glimpse of what is to come. I am impressed with this whole approach and the rate of innovation Gates replied. Microsoft is in talks to invest about 10 billion into OpenAI the owner of the popular ChatGPT chatbot per a Thursday Semafor report which cited people familiar with the matter.

2,Bed Bath & Beyond spikes 30% despite bankruptcy fears as Reddit crowd hopes for an M&A miracle,"One Reddit post that gained much attention suggested that a merger and acquisition agreement was ""100% DEFINITELY happening.""",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bed-bath-beyond-stock-price-bankruptcy-merger-hopes-reddit-meme-2023-1,Bed Bath Beyond stock jumped 30 Monday after last weeks heavy losses. The home furnishings retailer reported a bleak financial outlook and potential bankruptcy on Thursday. However Reddit users are speculating that a merger and acquisition deal could be looming to save the memestock company. Shares of Bed Bath Beyond soared 30 Monday amid speculation among Reddit users about a potential merger and acquisition deal. The rally comes after last weeks steep losses when the retailer warned quarterly sales were poor and that bankruptcy was one option on the table. Inventory snags and credit limits have weighed down the firms performance. But in one post from Thursday that received 1400 upvotes and nearly 500 comments Redditor Dan23DJR posited that a merger agreement was 100 DEFINITELY happening. The post cited an NT 10Q form explaining why Bed Bath Beyond may file earnings late as well as two December S4 filings as fuel for the acquisition theory. Reactions were largely positive to the Reddit explanation as other users cheered the line of reasoning with some calling for buying more shares and holding on to the meme stock. During the memestock craze of early 2021 short interest was extremely high in the homegoods company so alongside GameStop it dominated conversations on Reddits WallStreetBets page during much of the last two years. Shares soared as high as 54 in January 2021. They have since tumbled to about 1. 70. Still the stock has remained popular in some corners. In August one college student capitalized on a brief rally by netting a 110 million profit. The volume of trading that month was abnormally high according to FactSet data after trading was relatively muted in the months leading up to the surge. However shares tumbled 40 on August 18 when activist investor and GameStop exec Ryan Cohen sold his entire Bed Bath Beyond stake 9. 45 million shares via his firm RC Ventures. Bed Bath Beyond is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday following warnings that losses could be as steep as 40 or about 385. 8 million.
3,Arlo will stop supporting some of its older security cameras starting in April,"Arlo's older security cameras will lose access to future updates and some perks users have been enjoying these past years, now that the company has started implementing a new end-of-life policy for its products.

As users reported on Reddit via 9to5Google the company has sent out emails to announce the new policy and the first products to be affected the Generation 3 VMC3030 and Pro VMC4030 cameras which were released in 2014 and 2016 respectively. The two models will lose access to the seven free days of cloud storage Arlo bundles with its cameras starting on April 1st 2023. Theyll also be the first models to stop receiving firmware and security updates as well as bug fixes. In its full announcement PDF for the policy Arlo explained that it will pull its cameras four years after the last time they were mass produced. Following the first two models above the next Arlo cameras to lose access to updates and features include the Arlo Baby ABC1000 Pro 2 VMC4030P Q VMC3040 and Q VMC3040S. Their endoflife date is on January 1st 2024. The company will also stop supporting Arlo Lights ALS1101 and Audio Doorbell AAD1001 on the same date. To note users dont have to throw them out as soon as those dates arrive. They can continue using the cameras to access livestreamed videos as well as video clips stored locally with compatible Arlo base stations. But theyll have to pay for Arlos Secure subscription service to have access to cloud storage and the cameras will likely lose features over time since theyll no longer get firmware upgrades. In addition to putting an EOL date on its products Arlo is also phasing out its email notifications and E911 emergency calling service on April 1st as well as its Legacy Video Storage on AWS S3 on January 1st 2024. The company said it will provide a 30day advance notice for products that will be affected by the EOL rule though so people can decide whether to buy newer devices or to continue using their old ones.
4,I got into Y Combinator as a solo founder and left with a $4.5 million investment. Here's how I got in on my second try and what it was like.,Y Combinator's Demo Day helped startup founder Kathryn Cross raise $4.5 million from investors like Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian for Anja Health.,https://www.businessinsider.com/y-combinator-startups-application-review-demo-day-yc-w22-2022-12,I got into Y Combinator as a solo founder and left with a 4. 5 million investment. Heres how I got in on my second try and what it was like. Kathryn Cross is the founder of Anja Health a cord blood bank that freezes stem cells for future disease treatment purposes. Cross joined Silicon Valleys hottest startup accelerator Y Combinator in January 2022. This astoldto essay is based on a conversation with Kathryn Cross the 23yearold founder of Anja Health based in Los Angeles about her experience in Y Combinator. It has been edited for length and clarity. I first heard about the startup accelerator Y Combinator when I was studying at Wellesley College and taking entrepreneurship classes at MIT. I found out more after graduating in January 2021 when I moved into Launch House a coliving space for founders in Los Angeles. I spent three months in the house building Anja Health a personalized cord blood bank that freezes umbilical cord and placentas stem cells for future disease treatment purposes while working as an experience designer for digitalconsulting company Publicis Sapient. Many of the founders living in the house were in Y Combinator and they told me how beneficial it was. I didnt get a lot of exposure to the tech world at Wellesley so I didnt feel fully equipped with the proper network resources or knowledge to run a successful startup. I felt I could find that in YC. YC invests 125000 in your company in return for 7 and then it invests a further 375000. I applied twice for YC and was accepted into the W22 batch which ran from January to April 2022. The first time I applied in February 2021 Anja Health was literally just an idea and barely a website. I left my job with Publicis Sapient in June 2021 to begin working fulltime for Anja Health. The second time I applied during the summer of 2021 I had revenue customers a functioning website and a supply chain. I filled out an online form and added a short video in my application The form included questions like What problem are you solving and How big is your market I conveyed most of what I wanted to say about my startup in the application form. For the video portion I just wanted to show how confident I was as a person. I wore bright colors to help me stand out and tried to speak with confidence. The next stage was a 10minute Zoom call with YC partners and entrepreneurs Jared Friedman Nicolas Dessaigne and Surbhi Sarna whom I would have the opportunity to work with if I was accepted. They asked me about the science behind my company what I thought about market size and what motivates me as a founder. Id practiced quite a few of my answers with people who had been through YC so I was prepared but the interviews are notoriously very short so I couldve said more. When I received the call that Id been accepted I was delighted. Ninety percent of companies accepted to YC have cofounders but I made it through as a solo founder. When I was in YC I would run my business from home as usual My YC experience was virtual so I completed it while living in Los Angeles. Each week I listened to online talks by successful founders of companies that went through YC like Airbnb and Stripe or experts in fields like SEO. I also connected with YC alumni via Bookface YCs version of Facebook. I not only had my mentors at YC but I was also mentored by the peers I was living with. You only need to commit a few hours each week to the YC program. Its not a case of taking time off from your startup to attend the course as they want you to work on your business and accelerate it. Each morning I would get up around 8 a. m. start work and then have calls with a partner whether that was Nicholas Jared or Surbhi. The final part of the threemonth course is Demo Day when you present to more than 1000 potential investors. A lot of them are former YC founders or partners. Its much less intimidating on Zoom than it is in person. I couldnt even see all the people in the room. While I was sitting in my living room looking at my laptop I could only see my slides on a screen and me. Presentations on Demo Day are so short as each company has just one minute to speak so it really doesnt require a ton of preparation. What you really have to prepare for is the fundraising that comes from Demo Day. Over the 3 months you spend at YC you learn everything from finding customers to fundraising While Id already raised 400000 in a preseed round in the summer before I joined YC the program especially its coverage of the fundraising process was still useful to me. The first time I fundraised I felt I was just flailing because I didnt have any processes in place. The second time I fundraised was after Id finished my YC course and not only was I very intentional about whom I reached out to but I also set timelines and tracked metrics like the response rate. In the seed round which ran from April to June 2022 and stemmed from Demo Day I raised 4. 5 million and investors included Reddits cofounder Alexis Ohanian. My goal for fundraising was to grow the company and increase staffing levels. When I applied to YC I was Anja Healths only member of staff. Now were a team of five. I still speak to my YC partners regularly. We have a group chat and I message them on an asneeded basis. I probably couldve achieved what Ive done without YC but it wouldve been a lot harder. In tech and the startup world your network is your net worth and YC is a really valuable network. Did you go through Y Combinator and have a story to tell Email Lauryn Haas at lhaasinsider. com.

5,Google Pixel January 2023 update breaks Bluetooth connectivity with cars,Google's most recent security update for its Pixel phones has broken the ability to pair the device with a user's car.,https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-january-2023-patch-bluetooth-problems,Google Pixel January 2023 update breaks Bluetooth connectivity with cars No tunes on the way to work should be a crime. What you need to know January 2023 security patch causes problems for Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 series devices. The phones are having problems connecting via Bluetooth with their vehicles after the latest update. Users have not been able to connect with cars from Kia Hyundai Toyota Honda Infiniti Volvo Subaru Mazda and Ford. Two parts of Googles ecosystem are at odds with its most recent smartphone security update. The past few days have been filled with Reddit users creating threads to voice issues with the January 2023 security patch and Bluetooth connectivity in their cars via Android Police. With the latest update Pixel 7 and Pixel 6 series phones refuse to pair with Android Auto for music playback and other features while on the road. Its caused some frustration with one Reddit user stating theyve factory reset the system in their car reset network settings and even restarted their phone to no avail. It was also found that the users car would pair with other phones and their phone would pair with other vehicles as well. Other users in the thread commented that their phone would briefly connect before providing an error message and disconnecting. Users continue to chime into the conversation stating that the problem appears to affect Kia Hyundai Toyota Honda Infiniti Volvo and Subaru vehicles. While user reports primarily mention those vehicles with some mentioning Mazda and Ford too its not every single model from these car makers. Apparently some owners of a 2012 Hyundai and 2015 Kia are having no problems at all with the January 2023 security patch and their Pixel. Google started rolling out its January 2023 security patch to eligible Pixel phones three days ago. While the update is light the patch did bring some fixes to Bluetooth specifically. The company was looking at rectifying some problems with Bluetooth devices not receiving audio as well as some lowenergy devices being unable to pair with your phone. It looks like somewhere in these Bluetooth fixes is the current problem drivers have been facing for the past few days. Considering this is most likely an issue with the software another patch to address this will most likely be required. People have contacted Google Support about the issue but have received no response as of yet. If youve yet to update your Pixel 6 series device or Pixel 7 series phone with the January 2023 patch it may be best to avoid doing so until Google properly addresses it. Android Central has reached out to Google about the latest issue caused by the most recent security patch but has not received word back in time for publication.

6,Bill Gates says he'll sell what he owns to fund his philanthropic foundation,"When asked if it was ""contradictory"" for him to be a humanitarian while owning so much farmland, Bill Gates said, ""Everything I own will be sold.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-will-sell-what-he-owns-money-towards-foundation-2023-1,Bill Gates says hell sell what he owns to fund his philanthropic foundation Bill Gates said Wednesday that hell sell what he owns as money goes toward the foundation he runs with exwife Melinda French Gates. When asked if it was contradictory for him to be a humanitarian while owning so much farmland Gates replied Everything I own will be sold. Bill Gates has pledged to give away most of his billions and now hes sharing more about those plans. On Wednesday the Microsoft cofounder did his annual Ask Me Anything session on Reddit where he answers a handful of questions posed by Reddit users on a variety of subjects. One Reddit user asked him Isnt it contradictory to be a humanitarian and then accumulate most scarce resourceland under one The user was referring to Gates purchases of farmland. Gates owns approximately 275000 acres of farmland in the US according to the 2022 edition of the Land Report 100 which tracks the biggest landowners in the country. There were 895. 3 million acres of farmland in the US in 2021 according to a February 2022 report from the Department of Agriculture. Responding to the question Gates said Everything I own will be sold as money moves into the Foundation. In the meantime my investment group tries to invest in productive assets including farmland although that is less than 4 of the total. In his response Gates was referring to the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation the philanthropic foundation he established in 2000 with his thenwife Melinda French Gates. The nowdivorced couple continues to run the foundation together it focuses on tackling issues like poverty inequity and infectious diseases. Gates created the Giving Pledge in 2010 alongside his exwife Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffett Gates close friend and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. The pledge asks the worlds richest people to commit to give away most of their wealth to charitable causes in their lifetimes or in their wills. In July Gates said he planned to give virtually all of his wealth to his philanthropic foundation acknowledging the move will ultimately lead to him falling off of the list of the worlds richest people.

7,Reddit poster says his wife is 'very angry' he now owns his dad's orphaned dog: 'Took the liberty',A man on Reddit sparked debate and controversy after saying his wife is angry he took in his father's nine-year-old cockapoo. Thousands of people weighed in ...,https://news.yahoo.com/reddit-poster-says-wife-very-070030737.html,Reddit poster says his wife is very angry he now owns his dads orphaned dog Took the liberty A Redditor thought he was doing the right thing by adopting his dads dog after the father died but his wife very much disagrees apparently. The husband who goes by the Reddit username glaucon15 recently sought advice in the Am I the Ae AITA subreddit after he faced pushback for taking in his deceased fathers nineyearold cockapoo. AITA for adopting my dads dog when he died even though my wife didnt want me to the man asked in a post he wrote on Dec. 19 on the platform. MODERN FAMILY CRISIS WOMEN WONT TAKE HUSBANDS CALLS WHEN HE PHONES THE KIDS TOO CLOSE TO BEDTIME The man began by saying that his father passed away from heart failure about two years ago. After his fathers longterm domestic partner reached out to share the sad news with glaucon15 about his dads passing it turns out that she unfortunately then died the same day due to poor health he continued. The Redditor said he then realized his fathers dog was left alone. CHRISTMAS CRISIS REDDIT POSTER SIDES WITH MOTHER NOT WIFE WHETHER TO HANG A STOCKING FOR HIS STEPSON I couldnt get into the house and had to force the door he wrote. He added The dog was obviously orphaned. A cockapoo small easy mild 9 years old no problems. I took the liberty of bringing her home. But what some might have considered an act of compassion even heroism was reportedly met with anger when the man returned home to his wife. My wife was a little shy of furious but very very angry the Redditor wrote. She said I should have asked her that its my house too FAMILY OUTRAGE DIVORCED MOM IS DEVASTATED WHEN TEEN SON WANTS TO SPEND CHRISTMAS WITH HIS SON He continued I wouldnt contradict that but under the circumstances I was certain that she would understand. I was very hurt by her insensitivity. He added Obviously I was somewhat stunned by grief and I couldnt imagine anything other than adopting the dog myself. The couple owns their home they already have two cats the Redditor said. He reiterated that the dog is low maintenance. Two years after he first took in the dog the Redditor said his wife still refuses to walk the dog because as she says its not my dog he noted. Occasionally she uses this incident to demonstrate how Im a bully in the relationship he also said. He said its not about getting his wife to do dog chores and she doesnt actually despise the dog but she remains firm about not taking care of her. I have been bold enough to suggest it on occasion such as when we had evening plans and she was already home but I was going to need to come home versus meeting up or if I wasnt feeling great he said. Ive been surprised when she holds that boundary the Redditor continued. Im guessing she would walk her if I was incapacitated shed be pissed though. SAD CAT SURRENDERED BY OWNER BECAUSE ANIMAL WANTED TO CUDDLE THEN GOES VIRAL Glaucon15 concluded that he still feels he had no excuse to not take the dog. It was a duty I welcomed he said. My wife didnt want it but that wasnt a suitable reason to defy my conscience. He added I couldnt imagine being the son who sends the dog to strangers or the Humane Society. Fox News Digital reached out to the original poster for comment. Thousands of Reddit users have been reacting to the family drama with split takes. Yes he was right to take in the poor dog when the tragedy occurred but forcing your spouse to house an animal they never wanted and then getting annoyed with them when they dont want to take care of it is pretty weird behavior Reddit user stalkertuesday commented. Redditor educationalfan6438 added that the wifes referring to her husband as a bully is a bit over the top. He had to force his way into the house to rescue the dog. Where was it to go the same commenter also said. She then cant understand that rehoming his late fathers companion might be emotionally difficult the commenter continued. The wife should try to show him the same compassion shed want if roles were reversed. New Yorkbased psychologist and cognitive behavioral therapist Jayme Albin Ph. D weighed in on the debate telling Fox News Digital that the argument isnt really about the dog. This is definitely a battle that has little to do with the dog and more about the dynamics in the marriage or even possibly the wifes relationship with her deceased inlaws she said in an email. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER It sounds like she thinks her hubby does what he wants without discussing it. Its not that she thinks his actions of adopting the dog were wrong but she feels disrespected because she wasnt consulted.

9,Southwest Employees Are Spilling Out Details On Airline's Meltdown On Reddit,Southwest employees have more details on the airline’s catastrophic meltdown.,https://news.yahoo.com/southwest-employees-spilling-details-airlines-205806875.html,Southwest Employees Are Spilling Out Details On Airlines Meltdown On Reddit Southwest employees have more details on the airlines catastrophic meltdown. As frustrations continue to build among employees with how the airline is handling nationwide cancellations and delays upset employees are dishing out the details of whats going on. Thousands of travelers are stranded as the airline struggles to get a hold of the situation. Phones are down and travelers are facing rebooking challenges. The only way for passengers to get a new flight is by braving the hourslong lines at the airport. And to make matters worse customers say they havent heard much from the leaders. CEO Bob Jordan recently announced the airlines problems stem from record bitter cold temperatures. In addition Jodran says staffing is a problem as employees are out of position in dozens of locations. The problem with Jordans statement as many travelers and critics point out other airlines are handling weather and staffing much better. If Youre Able To Find An Alternative Do It Employees Warn As Southwest travelers search for answers one employee appears to be giving better insight into whats causing the airlines meltdown. In a Southwest Airlines Reddit the employee starts by apologizing on behalf of the company. I will give it to you straight. This meltdown was caused entirely by Southwest the post continues. It was triggered by the storm but the failure to recover quickly is on Southwest 100. If you are still hearing weather almost a week after the storm its not true. According to the user the crew scheduling software is out of date. If we had better technology which eliminated the need for phone calls this would have been fixed by now the alleged employee explains. Currently crews use a system that requires them to call in for their schedule. Southwest has an operation configuration that differs from the other major airlines as The New York Times points out which hasnt allowed them to get the correct number of planes and crews back in the air. As we previously reported Southwest canceled or delayed more than half of their flights in the last several days leaving customers stranded and struggling to rebook. While the Reddit post is unofficial there are dozens of comments from other alleged employees with similar accounts. These employees are urging Southwest Airline customers to find alternatives if its not too late. When Will Passengers See Relief Theres no clear answer on when the Dallasbased airline will return to normal. Several customers shared on social media they were told to rebook for after the new year. What remains clear at this point is these problems from Southwest will last be felt for days. This is the worst round of cancellations for any single airline I can recall in a career of more than 20 years as an industry analyst Airline Expert Henry Harteveldt with Atmosphere Research Group told The New York Times.
10,"Bill Gates confirms he's still on team Android, not iPhone","Bill Gates previously said he prefers carrying around an Android and not an iPhone because he wants ""to keep track of everything.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-uses-android-smartphone-samsung-galaxy-fold-not-iphone-2023-1,Bill Gates confirms hes still on team Android not iPhone Bill Gates said he uses a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold4 during an Ask Me Anything on Reddit. He said the chairman of Samsung gave him his phone when he went to South Korea to update his Fold 3. Bill Gates confirmed hes still on team Android not iPhone during his eleventh Ask Me Anything on Reddit. Reddit user 1oarecare asked the Microsoft cofounder what his daily driver smartphone is noting that Gates said he used a Galaxy Fold during his last AMA. I have a Samsung Fold 4 which JY Lee the Chairman of Samsung gave me when I saw him in South Korea to update my Fold 3 Gates responded. The Galaxy Z Fold4 is a foldable smartphone that isnt cheap it retails for nearly 1600 in the US which is more expensive than the starting price tags for Apples iPhone 14 and 14 Pro. Gates said he uses Outlook and a lot of Microsoft software on his phone and because of its screen size he doesnt use a tablet just the phone and my portable PC a Windows machine. Android holds around 72 of the mobile operating system market share around the world according to StatCounter. Apple is in second place with almost 27 of the market share. Gates said he uses an Android because he wants to keep track of everything during an interview on Clubhouse in 2021. He said hell often play around with iPhones but depends on his Android because hes used to it. Some of the Android manufacturers preinstall Microsoft software in a way that makes it easy for me he said. In the same question on Reddit about his phone Gates was asked if hes in the know of upcoming Microsoft products and if he gets insights into new launches. Microsoft involves me in some of the research and product plans Gates said adding that he enjoys working with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella but that hes not up to date on the companys hardware roadmap. Gates who stepped down as Microsoft CEO in 2000 has said his greatest mistake ever was letting Google develop Android. The greatest mistake ever is the whatever mismanagement I engaged in that caused Microsoft not to be what Android is meaning Android is the standard nonApple phone form platform Gates said at an event hosted by venture capital firm Village Global in 2019. That was a natural thing for Microsoft to win. Microsoft launched its own Windowspowered phones but stopped selling them in 2017 after they couldnt make as great of an impact on the smartphone market as Androids and iPhones.

11,Pixel 7 owners report broken rear camera glass,"Right when we thought the Pixel 7 series was a refined and perfect device over its predecessors, new issues are now on the rise.",https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-7-series-users-notice-broken-camera-glass,Pixel 7 owners report broken rear camera glass Multiple Pixel 7 and 7 Pro users are witnessing random rear camera glass being shattered out of nowhere. What you need to know Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro owners are seeing broken glass cameras on the back. Some device users have seen the glass shattering during a sudden temperature drop. Google Support Team has responded to one of the users acknowledging the issue. One of this years most wellreceived flagship releases is the Google Pixel 7 series which builds upon the already great Pixel 6 smartphones. That said the Pixel 7 series isnt without its issues as we know by this point that no phone is flawless. That is because several users on Reddit and Twitter have reported about their rear cameraprotecting glass getting shattered out of nowhere along with the pixel7brokencamera hashtag. One user via PhoneArena claims to always put his phone in the case and that no drops have occurred in the month that he has owned the device he believes there is a manufacturing defect. Not even a month no drops just regular use. Have a case on the phone. Been told Its my problem. Is this really the quality control backed by google Its clearly a manufacturing defect and I know Im not the only one. Please fix this google madebygoogle pixel7brokencamera pic. twitter. compH6k7HxSuxDecember 26 2022 Likewise two months ago another Reddit user shared that he had a similar experience with his Pixel 7 which had a broken camera glass when he removed it from his pocket. However he is unsure if hitting around a corner while the device is in his pocket could be the reason for the blow. Another Pixel user who replied to the aforementioned Reddit user faced a similar issue. He even contacted thirdparty repairing services like UBreakiFix and one of them suggested it would cost around 200 to replace the whole back panel. However early this month Google finally agreed to replace the device after the said user provided the images of the broken glass. I would strongly avoid the Pixel 7 series from madebygoogle. There is a manufacturing defect and poor QA that leads to shattered camera lenses. Google is aware of the issue and has intentionally decided not to include it with warranty pixel7brokencamera httpst. cokWhCoVlJeh pic. twitter. comGvcYREScwADecember 22 2022 One of the Pixel 7 Pro has seen the shattered glass behind the ultrawide angle lens on the device. This random shattering of rear camera glass is not limited to the Pixel 7 but also to the Pixel 7 Pro as some other Twitter users pointed out the issue via Android Police. The owner who contacted Google Support got a response from the team indicating that they were aware of the issue. One Pixel 7 user had noticed the same broken glass case when there was a sudden temperature change. In the tweet the user mentions that the device experienced an external temperature drop from 16 degrees Celsius to 2 degrees Celsius and the glass was shattered. The temperature changes could be one of the reasons why several such glassshattering incidents are popping up in December than in the previous months since the devices launched. With many users reporting the issues on multiple platforms and for some Google acknowledging the issue and for others replacing the Pixel 7 devices the company is yet to go public about the concern. Update Google has said they are aware of the issue but is standing firm that it is not their responsibility. I was hopeful but ultimately the end result did not change. pic. twitter. comEBUlH18fSEDecember 23 2022 Of course its not the first time Google has dealt with hardware or software problems. However it seemed that the change to a mostly metal camera visor would have helped avoid problems such as this. That said if the issue becomes more widespread the company may be forced to address the issue.

12,The Out-of-Touch Adults' Guide to Kid Culture: Do You Really Need ID to Watch Porn in Louisiana?,"While the House of Representatives is stuck in a hellish series of endless votes that resolve nothing, their grandchildren are welcoming the new year by memeing a weird dog breed, offloading worthless NFTs, and lying to their parents about dead celebrities. B…",https://lifehacker.com/the-out-of-touch-adults-guide-to-kid-culture-do-you-re-1849957375,While the House of Representatives is stuck in a hellish series of endless votes that resolve nothing their grandchildren are welcoming the new year by memeing a weird dog breed offloading worthless NFTs and lying to their parents about dead celebrities. But at least they dont have drivers licenses so we know they are safe from watching online porn... in Louisiana anyway. Meet the newest meme dog the borzoi Move aside Pomeranians Shiba Inus and Corgis Theres a new dog sheriff in Memesville. Borzois are taking over the internet. Also known as Russian wolfhounds these pups were originally bred as sighthounds for hunting. Theyre athletic loyal and eventempered but thats not why TikTok likes them so much. The key to the breeds adorability is their comically elongated faces topped with big expressive eyes that make them resemble all kind of different objects in a uniquely poignant way. They look like soap dispensers pencils doorstops anteaters floppy socks and slices of pizza. They look hilarious with eyebrows. But mostly they look kind of vulnerable and sad. Borzois are the ultimate meme dogs until the next breed comes along. Why are kids telling their parents their favorite celebrities died If your kid or some other young person in your life tells you that your favorite famous person has died dont fall for it. Telling your parents their favorite celebrity has keeled over and filming the reaction is a trend thats been catching on over the last week or so on the TikTok machine. For the record Elton John Barack Obama Jennifer Anniston and Donald Trump are very much alive in spite of the videos showing adults anguished reactions to their deaths. I like a morbid joke as much as anyone and it can be funny to see how upset people get over the supposed deaths of people theyll never meet but on the other hand these videos are essentially mocking people for having emotions and thats not cool. Its especially not cool when you tell your parents that a friend of theirs who happens to be famous died as happened to actress Angela Bassett recently. Company buying worthless NFTs In what is perhaps a fitting coda to the entire NFT saga a couple of entrepreneurs have started a company that buys worthless NFTs so that people who invested in digital goods can at least unload them and writeoff the losses on their taxes. The firm is called Unsellable and it will buy any NFT purchased on the Ethereum blockchain regardless of the quality or rarity for the equivalent of one cent then send you a receipt so you can prove to the IRS that you actually did invest a lot of money in digital magic beans. They will not however sell you your NFT back for two cents. So far they say theyve purchased 5000 NFTs and are a little vague as to what theyre going to actually do with them. Since this takes place in the world of NFTs theres a chance it could be some kind of scam or boondoggle. Shocking I know. Louisianas new porn law raises serious questions A new state law went into effect on Jan. 1 in Louisiana that requires websites that host pornographic material to verify the ages of the people accessing their sites. Instead of clicking yes to the question Are you over 18 Louisiana pornenjoyers who try to access sites like Pornhub will have to provide ID that proves they are adults who want to masturbate. In practice that means setting up an account with the service AllPassTrust and sending em a copy of your drivers license. While Louisiana promises it wont collect or store user addresses and phone numbers its making some people nervous. Who wants their name on that list right Theres also the issue of the laws vagueness. It states that sites that contain more than 33. 3 pornography are required to verify ages but defining pornography beyond I know it when I see it seems impossible not to mention determining what sites are more than onethird porn. Theres a lot of porn on Reddit but is it a 33 How about Twitter If a site puts up two mundane photos for each naked one is it required to verify IDs I know The South does things a little differently but Id be surprised if this law isnt challenged in court quickly. Theres money to be made after all. Also whats to stop young people from using the most reliable porn site around Google Images Viral video of the week playing every single frogger game just to feel something YouTuber Noodle maintains an engaging channel where he talks about video games through homemade paper cutout puppets. This week he dives deep into the history of Frogger by playing every iteration of the series in the aptly titled video playing every single frogger game just to feel something. I didnt even know there were any Frogger games beyond Frogger but it turns there have been a ton of weird and mostly terrible attempts to bring the franchise to more modern game systems including a Legend of Zelda style outing called Froggers Journey The Forgotten Relic and a truly horrific 3D platform called Frogger The Great Quest. I know video game characters are just collections of pixels without human emotions but theres something sad to me about most modernizations of older game stars. I picture PacMan as a Norma Desmond type alone in his 80s mansion drunkenly reminiscing about when he was the biggest star in the world wondering how Mario has managed to stay relevant for so long and drunk dialing Ms. PacMan and hanging up.
13,Twitch Streamer Plays FromSoftware Games In A Truly Absurd Way,"Spend any time on the internet—whether Reddit, Twitter, or YouTube—and you’ve likely seen some streamer doing some absurd-ass playthrough of a Soulsborne game (probably Elden Ring). Whether it’s beating Margit with a harp or two Malenias simultaneously (one w…",https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-sekiro-demigod-run-electric-saxophone-1849970135,Spend any time on the internetwhether Reddit Twitter or YouTubeand youve likely seen some streamer doing some absurdass playthrough of a Soulsborne game probably Elden Ring. Whether its beating Margit with a harp or two Malenias simultaneously one with a dance pad there are some wild ways of tackling FromSoftware games out there. Streamer Dr. DeComposing is simply just trying to finish FromSofts games without dying in the first placeexcept hes using a freakin electronic saxophone to do so. This challenge run known as the Demigod Run has been renamed by Dr. Decomposing as theDeathless Doot Run. Its wild stuff. A doctoral composer which Kotaku verified Dr. DeComposing is known for playing games with the Roland Aerophone AE10 a roughly 700 digital wind instrument that can simulate clarinet flute sax synth violin and other sounds. Watching his streams is hilarious and stressful something always goes wrong. Sometimes his keyboard will lock up due to the interference of the electronic sax like the alt key getting stuck after playing a note on the instrument. Other times hell accidentally walk off a cliff because of an incorrect input. Hell he might even play with silly sounds like farts while trying to maintain focus such as when battling Malenia Blade of Miquella in Elden Ring. At least he isnt trying a hitless run of these games. Id probably die of laughter if every ingame action I made constituted a fart. Just Doot Through The Pain In an email exchange with Kotaku Dr. DeComposing said the electronic sax is connected to his computer via USB and sends MIDI signals whenever he plays notes. These messages are captured by Bome MIDI Translator a digital interface that converts those signals into mouse and keyboard inputs. There is a mod wheel or controller stick on the back of the instrument thats been programmed as a replacement analog stick to operate the ingame camera. Otherwise every action is performed by single doots. Vertagear 800 Series Gaming Chair Ergonomic comfort Adjustable seat height neck support memory foam pillow adjustable back rest and tilt locking system and 4D armrests that move in 4 directions to fit you best. As I play through a game I also have the Aerophone set up to play a variety of virtual instrument sounds and samplesthe MIDI messages that I set up to control the game are also routed to a Digital Audio Workstation DAW that stores my sound library Dr. DeComposing said. So every time I doot on the electronic saxophone it simultaneously presses a button on the gamepad and plays a little sound e. g. a recorder a taiko drum a chiptune beat a surprisingly tuneful fart etc.. During my streams viewers are also able to interact with the sound of the Aerophone by summoning the Wheel of Doots which randomly selects an Aerophone sound set from my library. These doots make up Dr. DeComposings gameplay. When his viewers arent voting on a sound from the Wheel of Doots a virtual spin board that includes a repository of swappable sample noises such as the word crab or random moans when he plays the Aerophone youll hear traditional instrumental notes like B5 and D5 that restore health and transform weapons in Bloodborne respectively. This is to both ease the frustration that comes with repeat deaths and restarts and to give his chatters a way to interact with the run by selecting the noises the instrument makes at regular intervals during his livestreams. Its pretty fun. Gravity Is The Real Big Bad Here In addition to the Demigod Run hes already completed saxcontrolled deathless runs of Bloodborne and Sekiro Shadows Die Twice both of which are watchable on his YouTube channel. Dr. DeComposing said Bloodborne took about two weeks to beat while Sekiro was approximately one month in the making. But aside from some bosses such as Bloodbornes Shadows of Yharnam the frequent runkiller for him was gravity. Since the Aerophone is monophonic and not polyphonic like a piano Dr. DeComposing tends to make one movement at a time with the doots. Plus the sole controller stick on the back of the instrument is programmed to function like WASD keys on a keyboard all of which makes platforming or any sort of precise maneuvering for Dr. DeComposing something of a headache. All of these controllerinput factors combined means that simple actions like running and turning simultaneously cant be done without more toggles I programmed into the Aerophones controls Dr. DeComposing said. And so platforming is a nightmare. The number of times Ive died to gravity because the Aerophone controls werent responding well is harrowing. Thats not to say its all been terrible. Dr. DeComposing talked about some of the simpler aspects of the run including Sekiros Folding Screen Monkeys and the Mist Noble who plays a beautiful flute melody but has become something of a joke miniboss in the Souls community for how easy it is to beat. While you would assume combat in FromSofts games would be insurmountable with an instrument Dr. DeComposing actually found fighting to be the easiest part because a lot of the camera control issues dont often apply. This is especially true of bosses like Bloodbornes Cleric Beast and Sekiros Guardian Ape which let him lock on to a single target so he can focus on hitting the right notes at the right time to get the dub. The Million Dollar Question Why I thought it would be impossible to effectively play any video games using the electronic saxophone at all Dr. DeComposing said. If it werent for stumbling upon Bome MIDI Translator in the summer of 2021 I would have guessed that this kind of gaming wouldnt have been possible for me to do. While the Bome MIDI Translator gave Dr. DeComposing the confidence that such a method of gaming could happen it took a bit more experimentation and tinkering to get things working effectively. He didnt jump straight into the Soulsborne games instead opting to start with easier titles like Studio MDHRs Cuphead and Nintendos The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time to ensure inputs functioned properly. I still thought it would be impossible to use a saxophone to beat Dark Souls 3 the first Souls game I played on the Aerophone in November 2021 Dr. DeComposing said. The programming for the controls was still pretty rudimentary and not exactly reliable and it was extremely awkward at first to try controlling the camera and the rest of the game simultaneously. But then I managed to beat Vordt of the Boreal Valley on my first try and could only think Holy shit this is actually possible For Dr. DeComposing that feeling of this absurd thing being possible is a high hes chased ever since murking the quadrupedal creature Vordt. But theres another more philosophical element he enjoys about this specific challenge. I discovered along the way another aspect of these challenges that I love the dichotomy of completing excruciatingly difficult tasks in the least serious way possible Dr. DeComposing said. The full video of me finally beating Malenia at level 1 on the Aerophone is 10 straight minutes of intense concentration and sweating bullets ending with genuine shock and emotion on my face when I beat her all while the Aerophone is triggering fart noises every time I dodge or attack or navigate a menu. That split between super intense and super silly is a space that I think is really fun to live in and I wouldnt have found it if I hadnt tried to continually push through what I thought was impossible. So whats the next FromSoftware game Dr. DeComposing will play through now that Bloodborne and Sekiro are done and dusted He doesnt have any particular order in mind but hes eyeing the Dark Souls trilogy right now. Once he finishes those three games hell move on to Demons Souls on PS5 and finally FromSofts magnum opus Elden Ring. But everything hes doing is a sort of trial run. After beating all seven games he plans to do it all over again backtoback with very few breaks. His ultimate goal is to complete a full Deathless Doot Run by the end of 2023.
14,YouTube Music begins testing live lyrics,YouTube Music has rolled out a scarce testing phase to users for its Casting UI and a live lyric feature.,https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-tests-ui-live-lyrics,YouTube Music begins testing live lyrics Theyre a little late but its still good to see. What you need to know YouTube Music is lightly testing a redesigned Casting UI and live lyrics alongside it. The lyrics currently being sung appear highlighted in white before it autoscrolls to the next line. The Casting UI features moving elements such as the album cover information on the artist songwriters and a blurred background. YouTube is seemingly beginning to test a new feature for those looking to sing along with their favorite tunes. A Reddit user posted the supposed testing features including a look at the redesign of YouTube Musics Casting UI via 9to5Google. The overall UI while casting your YouTube Music songs is where the testing begins. Through a Cast from their Pixel 6 Pro to a Chromecast Ultra the Reddit user found that when a song is beginning its album will remain front and center for a time before shifting off to the right side. In the empty center the songs artist and title will appear before giving way to the lyrics if available. The background of the Cast also appears to be a zoomedin version of the album the song is from. Since these are live lyrics the words will appear highlighted in white as the singer serenades you before scrolling to the following line. This is very similar to how the lyrics function on other popular music apps like Spotify. Its also been found that once the song finishes Google will display a list of credited songwriters. Also if there are no lyrics available to sing along with your Cast will simply show the albums art song title and the artists name in the center of the cast and not off to the side. The current testing of the live lyrics and the Casting UI redesign is not widely available unfortunately for any looking to take a gander. While this is a neat feature to see added to the casting feature of Android devices through YouTube Music it would be better if Google brought the live lyric feature to the mobile app. As it stands right now YouTube Music lyrics on your phone are static requiring you to scroll through them and hopefully not lose your way while singing. This still puts Spotify ahead of the Alphabetowned music streaming platform since these lyrics autoscroll and highlight for you right on your phone. YouTube Musics update from November introduced version 5. 32 to users which rolled in improvements to the Now Playing screen and hid the dislike button for songs. This update brought YouTube Music on Android more in line with other changes the company has been ushering in over the past few months. The Chromecast with Google TV HD can easily become the best new piece of tech in your home. The products runs Android 12 out of the box includes HDR support and works seamlessly with your Android phone. Googles Assistant is also readily standing by for any show or movie queries.

What you need to know Fossil Group has pushed the Wear OS 3 update to the Skagen Falster Gen 6. The update strips away Google Assistant while some users point out fewer available watch faces. Users must factory reset their watch and set up using the Skagen Smartwatches app. Fossil Gen 6 owners have been sitting pretty with the Wear OS 3 update for a little while now.

Installing Wear OS 3 is optional but you should be aware that Google Assistant is no longer present as it does not support Wear OS 3 devices powered by Snapdragon chipsets although Fossil maintains that its working with Google on bringing it back as soon as possible. Instead users are prompted to set up Alexa as an alternative. Wear OS 3 on the Skagen Falster Gen 6 is more or less the stock experience similar to the Pixel Watch but without the Pixelexclusive goodies. However the Fossil Wellness app is still present as is iOS compatibility although Google Wallet is not supported for iOS devices. The update also includes the December patch which rolled out to Fossil smartwatches last month and brought a number of improvements. Users on Reddit have pointed out that there appear to be much fewer watch faces available for the device with only eight options present. Thats compared to the 12 available for the Fossil Gen 6 Wellness Edition.

The cart was a fan favorite before it was discontinued during the COVID19 pandemic. United Airlines is bringing back its icecream sundae cart for businessclass passengers on all longhaul international flights. The ice cream had made a limited return last year but was only available on selected flights out of San Francisco. The airline announced that many more passengers would now be able to enjoy the perk from February. United said in an Instagram post on Saturday We all scream for ice cream Because the United Polaris business class Sundae Cart IS BACK A United staple for decades the cart featured a range of icecream toppings that were offered to businessclass flyers by flight attendants. The sundaes were a fanfavorite before they were discontinued at the height of the COVID19 pandemic. The airline replaced them with prepackaged ice cream in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus. The decision proved unpopular with some flyers. One United flyer said on a Reddit thread about the replacement ice cream Mine arrived rock hard and wasnt even edible. You needed a pick axe to get to the ice cream because it was frozen solid. United Airlines also said it was revamping the Polaris dessert service and bringing back a new threetier dessert cart for our signature icecream sundae service in the memo per Travel Noire. Representatives for United Airlines did not immediately respond to Insiders request for further comment.

He keeps his identity a secret but some folks on Reddit have speculated that he might be Canadian. Whoever he is and wherever hes located hes definitely made watching cooking videos way more fun. He provides deadpan snarky commentary on culinary creations from a variety of TikTok chefs and other foodforward accounts. Here he is commenting on some kind of taco casserole made with Doritos. He tells the person cooking to work faster which is one of his common complaints. In the end he rates the dish 510 and says Id eat it. And here he is showing a lot of disgust for some kind of maple peanut butter chicken concoction. He says Why and Its turning into a crime against humanity. My favorite critique though might be when he says The South weeps when they see this quoteunquote fried chicken. He gives the dish a zero. He also gives zeros to this testicle bark and this ramen cheese glop concoction which he declares is viral in the sense that it looks like a virus. He goes on to say It looks like the toilet when youre sick. This is a welldeserved and wellearned zero. This sink mac and cheese also earns a zero and this commentary This is like the final boss of shitty TikTok mac and cheese. This is fucking stupid. Its not all snark and ire though. He finds lots to love as well. Here he is praising a dog making food saying Its gonna be better than 90 of the shit I see on this app. And he has real true admiration for some folks he highlights including Nonna Gracie. Here he is praising her while she makes pork capricciosa. He explains 1010 I would eat it and simple foods the best food And here he is giving a 1010 to some very deliciouslooking cream puffs.

27,This crazed genius hacked a thermal pipe into his Surface Book 2,"A Reddit user tore apart their Surface Book 2, added a fan, and inserted a copper heat pipe, all in an effort to reduce thermal throttling.",https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/this-crazed-genius-hacked-a-thermal-pipe-into-his-surface-book-2,This crazed genius hacked a thermal pipe into his Surface Book 2 Why get a new laptop when you can tear yours down and put a heat pipe inside What you need to know A Reddit user fixed thermal throttle issues in a Surface Book 2 by adding a fan and inserting a copper heat pipe. The process resulted in significantly better performance lower temperatures when under load and the laptop using fans less frequently when not needed. Performing the hack required quite a bit of technical expertise so we dont recommend trying it yourself. The Surface Book 2 is a powerful and versatile laptop. Microsoft worked hard to have the system dissipate heat but some people have run into issues with high temperatures after extended use of the laptop. One Reddit user curie64hkg upgraded their Surface Book 2 by adding a fan and a copper heat pipe. During the same process they swapped the systems SSD as well. For context the Surface Book 2 has fans in the top portion of the device which can be detached and used as a tablet. Ventilation and active cooling are utilized in the base which is where the GPU sits. Heres what our editorinchief Daniel Rubino had to say about the laptops thermals in his Surface Book 2 review Microsoft did an excellent job of thermal dissipation with the Surface Book 2 15. Thats due in part to having fans in the tablet area for the CPU and adequate ventilation and active cooling for the GPU in the base. During intense gaming while maximizing the CPU and GPU the bottom of the Surface Book 2 15 did get warm peaking at 106 degrees F 41 degrees C but it was never hot or uncomfortable. Likewise the back of the display where the CPU resides also got warm but never got hot to the touch. The experience of curie64hkg seems to be rather different than that of Rubino. They saw thermal throttling poor performance under load and lag when playing 4K60 videos. To get around these issues they added a fan replaced an SSD and added a copper pipe. An extensive breakdown of the process includes before and after benchmarks images of the disassembly and assembly and a summary of the final results. The biggest changes were to system temperatures. Tablet mode no longer slows down or heats up when drawing according to curie64hkg. Fans stay off when simply browsing the web as well. Idle temperatures and temperatures under load all dropped as well. A job like this is rather extreme so we cant recommend it to the average user but it is fun to see someone tinker with a Surface Book 2 and see such dramatic results.

The film was a glorious celebration of SpiderMans cinematic history that brought Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfields versions of the character back into the fold. The decision to have three different variants of Peter Parker from different eras proved to be a genius one as it allowed fans of all ages to see their version of SpiderMan on the big screen. Aside from the obvious homages and references that came equipped by enlisting classic SpiderMan actors the movie was also filled with several SpiderMancentric memes. Hell Tobey Maguires entrance through a portal was an obvious homage to the hilarious Bully Maguire YouTube memes. Even though one could assume that Maguire was aware of the memes there hadnt been any confirmation on the matter.

Magurie starred as the very first liveaction SpiderMan on film and he had three very beloved films directed by Sam Raimi. SpiderMan 3is probably the most notable due to the fact that it spawned a lot of memes and one of those memes is Bully Magurie.

29,"How to Hire a Great Tech Team, According to the Founder of OfferUp","Nick Huzar, the founder of OfferUp, advises fellow entrepreneurs on his playbook for building powerful teams.",https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-hire-a-great-tech-team/441434,How to Hire a Great Tech Team According to the Founder of OfferUp Nick Huzar the founder of OfferUp advises fellow entrepreneurs on his playbook for building powerful teams. Entrepreneurcontributors are their own. Hiring technical talent for earlystage tech startups is no easy task but with the right knowhow you can make sure your startup has the best chance of success. Fortunately we had the chance to chat with Nick Huzar founder and board member at OfferUp about his experience in this area. He broke this process down into four simple steps. If you want to learn more Nick and other amazing available for oneonone video calls powered by Intro. Book a session and get your specific questions answered. Step 1. Be clear about your hiring needs Its important to take a sober look at what you can do and what you need help doing Nick says. To begin looking for engineering talent its essential that you understand what skillsets and experience are necessary for your project. Take time to determine exactly what qualities need to be present in each candidate this will allow for more efficient screening of potential hires. Consider the skills and expertise that are necessary to build your product as well as any complementary skills that will be helpful to have on the team. What are your company goals and how do you see this role helping you achieve them What work gives you energy and motivates you to succeed Dont just focus on the positives. What saps your energy Do you lack organizational skills Are you technical in some areas but lacking in others You need a yin to your yang people who are strong in areas you are not as solid in or just hate doing. At an earlystage tech startup you need someone who can sit down with you over coffee and whiteboard out your ideas. You need someone to complement you. When youre looking for technical talent at an earlystage startup you want to find individuals you can work sidebyside with and who can also divide and conquer. Related Get oneonone mentorship with an easytobook video call Step 2. Look everywhere for candidates In the early days network your butt off Nick stresses. He advises you to against the grain to find candidates and encourages you to find creative ways to find people who fit your work style and philosophy. Make a custom Tshirt with DEVELOPERS WANTED printed on the top and the tech stack requirements detailed below. Wear this shirt around town. Research technology networking forums and meetups in your town. Set aside two hours for three days of the week and get away from your desk to network. Standing out amongst other companies can be challenging and this playbook was crucial for Nicks success in the early days of team building. Dont outsource your development work because future investors are going to want to know who is on your team and what have you built. So outsourcing may help you move forward but it will hurt your chances of fundraising cost you more money and make you move slower. Step 3 Ask good questions You need to make sure the candidate has experience in the right technology stack and is a good fit for your company culture says Nick. Here are 10 of Nicks technical interview questions Can you explain a technical challenge that youve faced and how you overcame it Describe a project that you worked on where you had to use a new technology or technique. How did you learn about it and what was the outcome Can you provide examples of how you have used your technical skills to solve problems or improve processes in your previous roles What programming languages are you familiar with and how do you stay uptodate with new technologies Can you explain how you would go about debugging a problem in a piece of code How do you approach testing and quality assurance in your work Can you give an example of a time when you had to learn a new technical skill quickly How did you do it How do you balance the need for speed and efficiency with the importance of writing clean maintainable code How do you stay organized and manage your workload when working on multiple projects or tasks at the same time Can you describe a technical project that you are particularly proud of and explain why As you listen to their answers and give deeper look for candidates who have an entrepreneurial spirit. Look for people who are comfortable with ambiguity and can adapt quickly to change. On the cultural side Nick recommends looking for adaptable people who are willing to put in the blood sweat and tears to make your startup a success. He also suggests looking for those who are scrappy and willing to wear many hats as well as people who have a bias for action and a startup stomach that allows them to keep going despite setbacks and failures. You want a swissarmy knife. Step 4. Nail the offer The OfferUp corporate bank account was down to 350 the day their Series A funding arrived. Capital is more readily available to Nick but he still believes that you dont want earlystage hires who are focused entirely on cash compensation. The question shouldnt be What do you want to make but sometimes its What do you need to live The tradeoff is lower cash and higher ownership in the company. At the end of the day hiring is a huge challenge but its worth taking the time to find the right person for your team. With Nicks advice in mind youll surely have a better chance of finding that perfect fit.
