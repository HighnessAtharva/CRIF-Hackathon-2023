Youll get 12 or 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM along with up 512GB of UFS 4. 0 storage and it should have OnePluss Color 13 version of Android 13 right out of the box. Full camera specs have yet to be released but were seeing three cameras on a circular module with Hasselblad branding front and center. Along with the smartphone shown in green and black colors OnePlus is expected to unveil the Buds Pro 2 and TWS earbuds on January 4th and also internationally in February.

3,Oppo smartphones could launch with an in-house chipset in 2024,"Oppo has reportedly hired thousands of people to develop its own smartphone chipset, suggesting that it won't rely on external partnerships.",https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-to-launch-in-house-smartphone-chipset-in-2024,Oppo smartphones could launch with an inhouse chipset in 2024 Rumors about the company building its own smartphone processor began in late 2021. What you need to know Oppo has been rumored to be working on its own smartphone chipset. The Chinese phone maker will reportedly launch its first handset with an inhouse processor in 2024. Oppo has apparently recruited thousands of people to form its own chipset division which is said to be working on the project. Oppo has been rumored to be developing its own smartphone chipset for quite some time now and the latest whispers suggest that the company will finally launch the inhouse processor in 2024. According to Ice Universe opens in new tab the Chinese phone maker has formed a new team consisting of thousands of employees for the project. It is not clear whether other BBK Electronicsowned brands including OnePlus Realme and Vivo would use the rumored chipset but it will mark a pivotal shift in Oppos operations. The new rumor suggests Oppo wants to gain more control over its smartphone business by minimizing its dependence on thirdparty vendors for smartphone components. In late 2021 there were speculations that the firm would use TSMCs 3nm process to massproduce chipsets for Oppo smartphones. According to rumors at the time Oppo planned to introduce its own processor sometime in 2023 or 2024. It seems that cutting reliance on major chip makers like Qualcomm is slowly becoming a goal for Android OEMs. Google has long done this as has Samsung with its Exynos line though the South Korean tech giant may be considering forming a new chipset division independent of Samsung LSI which manufactures the Exynos chipsets. Huawei used to build its own Kirin processor though it went out of business due to U. S. government bans. Oppos supposed efforts arent entirely unprecedented. Many of todays best Android phones are powered by custom chips such as the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 lineups which use Googles Tensor chip. In some parts of the world Samsungs existing Galaxy flagship devices ship with Exynos chipsets except for those sold in the U. S. though this will change soon. The company is no stranger when it comes to building an inhouse chipset either. Oppos Find X5 series debuted with the MariSilicon X imaging NPU the companys firstever custom processor. It wont be too surprising therefore if Oppo starts producing its own smartphone chips next year.

While much of the credit does to the highend sensors and lenses that Vivo has equipped its devices with the chipset inside of the phone also plays a big role in how the images and videos are processed. Up until now Vivos highend devices have all been powered by Qualcomm chipsets but the new Vivo X90 Pro is one of the first devices to use the Dimensity 9200 giving MediaTek the perfect opportunity to show off the image processing capabilities of its highend chipset. We had the opportunity to capture a few dozen photo and video files with the Vivo X90 Pro at CES 2023 so weve put together a video and image gallery to show off what the cameras on the device are capable of. Vivos next foldable expected to launch in 2023 with latest chipset in tow Based on our limited time with the Vivo X90 Pro the image processing provided by the MediaTek Dimensity 9200 matches what wed seen from its main competitor. Take a look at the images and photos below to get a closer look at how the cameras on the Vivo X90 Pro handle themselves in a variety of different lighting conditions.

Coming up at the last minute is vivoÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs performance sub-brand iQOO, presenting to...",https://www.yankodesign.com/2022/12/27/vivo-iqoo-11-review-an-excellent-flagship-that-will-go-unnoticed/,PROS Highend specs in a vanilla model Large fastcharging battery Decent cameras especially at night CONS No dust or water resistance rating Limited availability Forgettable design Alpha variant The year is almost over but smartphone manufacturers arent exactly done yet. Coming up at the last minute is vivos performance subbrand iQOO presenting to the world what is actually one of the first entries into the next generation of smartphones that will be arriving next year. This gives the brand the opportunity not only to end the year with a bang but also to start the next one on the right foot. But with so many smartphones already in the market and more yet to come one has to wonder if every new model has what it takes to even get a bite out of that lucrative yet crowded market pie. Thats the challenge facing the nascent iQOO 11 so we take it for a test drive to see if it can stand out and rise above its peers. Designer iQOO Aesthetics Designing the appearance of a smartphone can be a delicate and unrelenting balancing act. On the one hand you need to be noticeable at first glance even from afar to attract attention and potential buyers. On the other hand the markets high and rapid turnover of designs means that its difficult to pick out brands and even models just by looking at them. This tugofwar between individuality and brand recognition is an everpresent struggle for most smartphone makers aside from Apple and it seems that iQOO has tried to play it a bit safe this time around. The iQOO 11s basic design is pretty much standard among phones with large rectangular camera islands taking up an obscene amount of space on their backs. To its credit iQOO has been using this structure on a large number of its phones varying only the arrangement of the lenses and the placement of the bumps chin. To be fair the iQOO 11s appearance isnt as obnoxious as others but at the same time it might also look a tad plain to the eyes all too common in a sea of smartphones with large rectangular boxes housing their cameras. Granted thats only true for the black Alpha variant were reviewing. This model gets an AG frosted glass for its back that makes the phone look stylish yet subdued. The other Legend variant however has more personality thanks to its BMW M branding. That is expressed in a predominantly white back with the motorsports iconic red black and blue stripes running down its back. Beyond appearances however there is also more variety in materials used here including vegan leather for the majority of the surface and fiberglass for the stripes. Not everyone will like this more active design but its hard to deny it is more memorable and identifiable as well. The iQOO 11s back curves at the edges to meet the premium aluminum frame a bit of a holdover from the days when curved was fashionable. In contrast the phones display is completely flat which is the current trend on most devices with some exceptions. The large 6. 78inch screen is surrounded by very thin bezels leaving plenty of room for content. As they say content is king and the bright and vibrant display definitely enthrones it in the best way possible. Ergonomics Considering how we use our smartphones for long periods of time every day it is paramount that they are comfortable to hold in our hands. Given how expensive they have become its also important that they allow a firm grip on the device to prevent it from slipping or falling off our hands. Unfortunately the design of some phones and the materials they use dont always work towards that goal. The iQOO 11s 208g weight isnt much especially for a phone with this big a screen. It gets a bit less wieldy however when you consider the size of the device the material on its back and how youre forced to hold it for some operations. The black Alphas frosted glass is nice to look at and feels good in the hand but its also slippery and almost precarious. Fortunately iQOO does ship its phones with a clear silicone case as a protective measure. Unsurprisingly the Legend doesnt have this problem thanks to its more textured leather back. One small but important consideration is the placement of the fingerprint scanner on the screen used to unlock the device or authenticate logins and transactions. On the iQOO 11 its a little too low for comfort forcing you to place your hand lower which could make it slip from your hand or use a finger from your other hand. Its definitely doable but not exactly comfortable. Other than those considerations though the iQOO 11 is definitely a joy to hold in your hand or hands. The curved edges of the back cover dont cut into your hand though the ergonomic benefits of such a design are now being contested by flatter designs. Given the power that the phone offers and the experiences it unlocks you might easily forget about such considerations at least until you feel the soreness in your hand or worse accidentally drop the phone onto the pavement. Performance Manufacturers often reserve the best specs for Pro models leaving vanilla or base models to be flagships only in name and appearance. Thats what makes the iQOO 11 an unexpected but muchwelcomed surprise because it bears most though not all of the features youd expect from a highend and expensive premium phone. That starts with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which needs no introduction. Together with fast UFS 4. 0 storage the phone exhibits charttopping performance whether youre just browsing the Web playing games or even creating content such as videos and images. The 1440p 144Hz AMOLED display is also a big surprise literally and figuratively. It is simply one of the best panels around reaching high brightness levels and displaying accurate colors that you can tweak to your preference. That high refresh rate though feels more like a marketing stunt than an essential feature since very few apps other than benchmarks seems to be able to use it. For the most part the phone intelligently switches between 60Hz and 120Hz depending on the content ensuring that videos and games will be buttery smooth while prolonging battery life for other tasks. To support all this power the iQOO 11 has a pretty large 5000 mAh battery that is responsible for most of the heft youll feel in your hand. With moderate regular use youll find yourself left with just a little under 50 at the end of the day and even an intense day of watching and gaming will still see you through until you need to recharge at night. And when it does come to recharge you only need around 24 minutes to go from flat to 100 thanks to the included 120W charger. Suffice it to say you wont be wanting for anything when it comes to allday power and performance. iQOO did seem to cut back a bit on the cameras though not in any way that ruins the iQOO 11s winning streak. On paper the trio of sensors that live on its back sound middling or mediocre but in practice only one of those fits that description. The 50MP main camera produces very good images whether under bright light or on overcast days. The 13MP 2x telephoto camera is hardly perfect but it is able to manage on its own quite well. Its the 8MP ultrawide sensor thats the black sheep of the family resulting in images that are good enough but never notable. Overall the phone does remarkably well in this area considering the hardware it has to work with. Part of its success likes in vivos V2 imaging chip which can be credited for the cameras excellent nighttime performance that makes a dedicated Night Mode almost superfluous. Sustainability If the iQOO 11s design looks common its sustainability is just as similar as other phones in the market. That is to say there isnt much to talk about it especially in a positive light. It has the usual blend of nonsustainable materials both inside and outside though the use of vegan leather on the Legend edition might be a point in its favor. Theres also little to no word on the companys commitment to sustainable practices even in packaging. The fact that it ships with a charger might even seem detrimental though youd be hardpressed to find a compatible 120W charger anyway. What makes the phones situation a little worse is that it has no advertised IP rating for dust and water resistance. While phones are always manufactured to a certain standard of durability there is no assurance that they all have the same survival chances against small particles and liquid. Granted an official IP rating is quite expensive and sometimes unnecessary in light of a manufacturers assurances. Sadly iQOO doesnt even make claims to assure buyers of the devices longterm survivability. Value The iQOO 11 definitely checks all the right boxes when it comes to smartphone features at least for those parts that interest users. It might not look impressive unless you grab the BMW Mbranded variant but many wont mind that if they can get a highperformance device without overspending. Again the iQOO 11 aims to please with a price tag that amounts to around 540 significantly lower than most premium flagships. The problem however is whether you can get your hands on one in the first place. Unlike its parent company iQOO has an even shorter list of markets that it serves mostly in China and Southeast Asia. That means that despite all the power and performance that it can deliver you wont be able to experience a single one of those. You could try your luck importing it from other retailers but network compatibility concerns make it a rather expensive gamble. Youll be better off buying something thats actually available in your area even if it doesnt have the same features. Verdict The vivo iQOO 11 is the epitome of how looks can be deceiving. Although it is by no means unattractive its rather common design might get it easily overlooked by potential buyers looking for something more noteworthy even without a case or skin. The BMW M Legend edition does have more character but not everyone will fall in love with the sports car branding. If you manage to look past appearances though you will find a very capable device that will get you through a day with aplomb. Whether its for serious business distracting games or even content creation the iQOO 11 has enough muscle to support your every need and whim. That said they also say that the devil is in the details and small nitpicks here and there could make it look less attractive not to mention completely unfeasible. The cameras are good but not excellent and the lack of IP rating could nag peoples subconscious minds. Theres definitely plenty of room for improvement and plenty of opportunities for an iQOO 11 Pro to steal the spotlight. Unfortunately neither phone will be available on a wider global scale making all of these nice things ultimately moot for many people.,2022-12-28T04:20:36Z,vivo iQOO 11 Review: An excellent flagship that will go unnoticed,Extremely Positive,590,"CONS, dust, resistance, Limited, crowded, unrelenting, difficult, struggle, obscene, bumps, obnoxious, subdued, hard, deny, expensive, falling, Unfortunately, precarious, problem, soreness, worse, unexpected, expensive, stunt, intense, ruins, mediocre, superfluous, detrimental, worse, dust, resistance, expensive, unnecessary, Sadly, problem, concerns, expensive, deceiving, unattractive, fall, distracting, lack, nag, steal, Unfortunately, moot","chin, devil","Highend, iQOO, Aesthetics, lawsuit"
6,VivoÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs next foldable expected to launch in 2023 with latest chipset in tow,"The latest rumors are claiming that VivoÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs next foldable is expected to arrive in 2023 with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset in tow.

If you liked what you saw but decided to sit out on it and wait for the next generation then you might be interested to learn that a post on Weibo by leakster Digital Chat Station has confirmed that the Vivo X Fold 2 is expected to launch in 2023. We suppose this shouldnt really come as a surprise. With Samsung heavily pushing their foldable phones companies like Vivo probably dont want to sit around and let Samsung steal all the market share especially since foldables have proven themselves to be rather popular despite it seeming like a novelty design at the start. The post by Digital Chat Station has also confirmed that the handset will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset which once again shouldnt really come as a surprise since we expect that the majority of the 2023 flagships will use Qualcomms flagship chipset as well. Other than that not much else is known about the Vivo X Fold 2. It was also not mentioned if the Fold will also be getting a successor so well just have to wait and see so until then take all of this with a grain of salt until the details can be confirmed.

7,2022 Winners and losers: vivo,"vivo was among the top smartphone players, even if Western markets once again only saw a fraction of its lineup. The company launched some impressive products in 2022, but it didn't go without missteps too.

Winner: vivo X80 Pro

The X80 series did not have aÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦",https://www.gsmarena.com/2022_winners_and_losers_vivo-news-56982.php,vivo was among the top smartphone players even if Western markets once again only saw a fraction of its lineup. The company launched some impressive products in 2022 but it didnt go without missteps too. The X80 series did not have a Pro variant meaning the X80 Pro was the flagship this time around. It launched in April and at the time it was everything you would want from a flagship the best chipset from Qualcomm or Mediatek at home four impressive cameras Zeiss optics with T lens coating OIS fast charging. Eight months later it still is a phone worth considering if you are one for nontraditional brands. The design of the camera island is questionable to put it mildly but thankfully all the shooters do an amazing job. The phone took more than two months coming to international markets and the official price in Europe was just south of 1200 which is on par with Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. The phone comes with vivo V1 ISP which does wonders for lowlight videos we can see details in the footage that cannot be seen with the human eye and in 4K mind you. The vivo X80 Pro performance in the dark is borderline night vision. There are three phones in the V25 family and we were unimpressed with the vanilla and the Pro during our reviews. The reason were pooling them together is they have similar shortcomings. The V25 and V25 Pro were supposed to be a step above the V23 and V23 Pro introduced earlier in 2022 and both were priced a bit higher than direct rivals. Yet for some reason vivo decided to omit key features that make the midrangers harder to recommend. The vivo V25 pair has no NFC no 3. 5mm audio jack no ingress protection no secondary selfie camera. vivo launched the V25 in some markets as X80 Lite continuing its practice of rebranding phones many times over a habit we are not particular fans of. vivo launched two foldable phones this year although they were pretty similar. The Plus was launched five months after the first X Fold and it came with the updated Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and its mightier CPU. The battery also grew along with the charging speed from 66W to 80W. The biggest issue in the world of foldables is the crease which is a dealbreaker for many users. The hinge that vivo used in these two phones is said to be undetectable although we did feel and see it in reallife scenarios. That said the crease is hardly an issue when viewing content and it is not really felt during use. The company also brought a new color with the X Fold an appealing Red leather back also seen on the vivo X90 Pro. Vivo is clearly betting on this to be the hero color and we cant wait to see the design reach more devices hopefully even beyond the flagship X series. The iQOO subbrand does its own thing like the Neo series that can be placed in the flagshipkiller premium category and we loved the Neo6 that was launched on the international scene. Yes the phone runs on a dated Snapdragon 870 instead of a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 but that is still a greatly performing chip. What we particularly loved about the iQOO Neo 6 is its design and lightweight body. Todays smartphones get heavier and bulkier all the time. Meanwhile this vivo phone has all the necessary features without going overboard an excellent screen 80W fast charging and great video and photo quality from the main camera. The phone is mainly targeted in India where it can be purchased for as low as INR30000 or just about 360. This is definitely among the bargains of the year. 2022 was quite an unusual year for football fans. Instead of getting their fix on world cup matches in June and July we got a tournament in November and December. The 2022 World Cup was supposed to be the culmination of a sixyear partnership between vivo and FIFA in which the tech company supported other tournaments as well the Confederations Cup in 2017 the World Cup in Russia in 2018 and the Arab Cup in 2021. However the unusual timing meant the company had to promote its X90 series which is currently only available in China and China didnt qualify for the tournament. While all the advertising is good for promoting the brand recognition it always works best when theres an actual product people can buy involved. And the X90 series werent it at the time of the tournament. I am about to watch the video also but I also want mrwhosetheboss to review the cameras also,2022-12-27T21:11:01Z,2022 Winners and losers: vivo,Extremely Positive,110,"questionable, dark, shortcomings, omit, issue, issue, bulkier",Arab,-

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦",https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_x90_series_malaysia_launch_soon-news-57133.php,Update We have confirmation that the X90 Pro isnt launching for now. At least not in Malaysia. It remains to be seen if it will be released in global markets or remain exclusive to China. Original story The vivo X90 series smartphones unveiled in China last November is rumored to make its global debut on January 31. vivo hasnt confirmed the date yet but its Malaysian branch has announced that the X90 lineup is coming to the Southeast Asian country soon. The vivo X90 series consists of three smartphones X90 X90 Pro and X90 Pro. The press note we received suggests the Chinese brand will only launch the X90 and X90 Pro in Malaysia. vivo hasnt explicitly mentioned the Pro anywhere and the event page set up on vivo Malaysias website only shows the Pro model. The topend Pro is nowhere to be seen in the promo campaign. However one of the teasers shared by vivo hint at a periscope telephoto camera which you only get with the X90 Pro casting some doubt. vivo X90 series is launching soon in Malaysia The vivo X90 Pro is the most exciting smartphone among the X90 trio with key highlights being the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC 50MP primary camera using a 1 IMX989 sensor and a 6. 78 120Hz 1440p curved LTPO4 AMOLED display. vivo X90 vivo X90 Pro vivo X90 Pro You can read our vivo X90 Pro Pluss announcement coverage here to know more about it and head this way to learn more about the X90 and X90 Pro. You can also check the detailed specs comparison of the X90 trio here. All I have heard is problems with the 12S which is why it didnt get a global release because no one in China complains. So I dont really have much faith in the 13 Ultra. 200 is about US215 if we take the exchange rate in July 2022 when the Vivo launched in Europe. In Malaysia and surrounding ASEAN countries the difference was around US250.

10,"The Pixel 6a and Pixel 7 Pro Have the Best Smartphone Cameras of 2022, According to Blind Test",A massive blind camera test with more than 20 million votes picked Google's Pixel 6a as the best overall smartphone camera of the year.,https://www.makeuseof.com/best-smartphone-cameras-2022-pixel-6a-pixel-7-pro-marques-brownlee/,In what is surely the most comprehensive blind test of smartphone cameras ever the Pixel 6a has been named the best overall camera of 2022. The test carried out by YouTubes biggest tech reviewer Marques Brownlee compared 16 devices released in 2022 and took in votes from over 600000 users. Best for portraits was the Pixel 7 Pro the Oppo Find X5 Pro was best for daylight photos and the Vivo X80 Pro best in low light. The Best Smartphone Camera of 2022 The test looked at 16 smartphones from 2022 including the obvious flagships cameracentric devices some midrangers and a few random choices. Three identical pictures were shot on each devicea standard daylight photo a lowlight photo and a portraitand all identifying data was removed from the images. Users were then asked to vote on their favorites from a series of random comparisons and an ELO rating system was used to sort the more than 21 million votes to find the winners. The phones included in the test were Huawei Mate 50 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Moto Edge 2022 Nothing Phone 1 OnePlus 10 Pro Oppo Find X5 Google Pixel 6A Realme 10 Pro ROG Phone 6 iPhone SE Google Pixel 7 Pro Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra Sony Xperia 1 IV Xiaomi 12s Ultra Asus Zenfone 9 Vivo X80 Pro The Winners The best overall winner was the Pixel 6a with the Pixel 7 Pro and Asus Zenfone 9 in second and third. The iPhone 14 Pro was down in 7th place. And what finished bottom The Sony Xperia I IV took last place on the list with the Moto Edge 30 Ultra just above it. The winners for each type of shot were the Oppo Find X5 Pro for the best standard photo the Vivo X80 Pro for best lowlight photos and the Pixel 7 Pro for the best portraits. All the cameras were tested on Auto mode so the voting was as much a judgment on the software as the hardware which goes a long way to explain why Googles phones did so well and why Sonys excellent hardware did so poorly. Pixels have rarely had the best camera specs but have always been among the best camera phonesalthough its looking like the Pixel 8 series could get a big upgrade. The Pixel Phones Are Camera Champions Although sensor sizes are slowly growing software remains as important as ever in helping to overcome the hardware limitations of camera phones. Googles Pixel phones are incredibly strong in this area. They take great HDR portrait or lowlight shots and also have bags of unique features like Real Tone for shooting accurate skin colors Face Unblur and the everpopular Magic Eraser.,2022-12-22T11:08:30Z,No Headline,Extremely Negative,310,"poorly, limitations","blind, shooting","Marques, Brownlee"
