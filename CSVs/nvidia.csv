In October NVIDIA reversed plans to release that model and suggested it would rebadge the GPU. Meanwhile rumors indicate NVIDIA will sell the RTX 4070 Ti for 799. It was previously expected that the price would be 899 but NVIDIA may have lowered it after the US delayed tariffs on GPUs that were set to resume on January 1st.

NVIDIA has announced that its bringing GeForce Now game streaming to cars using the companys Drive platform. The rollout will offer access to titles like Cyberpunk 2077 on a driver display while youre charging or parked or any time from the backseat. That could be more than a little helpful on a vacation especially if youd rather not buy a Steam Deck or Switch for a budding young gamer. The cloud gaming option already has initial support from major brands like the Hyundai group including Genesis and Kia Polestar and Chinas BYD. NVIDIA didnt offer a timeframe for GeForce Now access although it noted that BYD would offer Drive Hyperionpowered cars in the first half of 2023. The Polestar 3 SUV built using Drive Orin arrives in late 2023. The incar GeForce Now client works on either Android or webbased infotainment systems. NVIDIAs service provides a catalog of 1500 games over 1000 of which are playable using gamepads. While most of the selection is paid there are freetoplay options like Destiny 2 and Fortnite. As with other game streaming services this could get costly if you plan to use it often. While basic GeForce Now use is free you can pay up to 200 per year for the full experience before you factor in the cost of the games themselves. In some cases though this might make more sense than buying a handheld console or tablet. You only need to pay for a higherend plan when you expect to use it after all you could subscribe during a road trip and stick to free usage when youre commuting around town.,2023-01-03T16:45:11Z

However since the company hasnt yet announced pricing its harder to discern the latest models value. The Nebula display is found in more models than ever this year. That company branding denotes screens with high frame rates 120Hz for 4K and QHD screens and 240Hz or higher for 1080p bright backlights and vivid colors. Meanwhile the new Nebula HDR variant is like an ultrapremium version highlighting Mini LED panels. For example the Nebula HDR display in the Strix SCAR 16 is a Mini LED with 1024 dimming zones double last years model and a 240Hz refresh rate. Although we dont yet know the pricing its a safe bet those models will fetch top dollar. The new laptops which launch in Q2 also have updated 13thgen Intel or AMD Ryzen Zen 4 processors depending on your configuration. NVIDIAs new GeForce RTX 40 Series Laptop GPUs power the graphics in maxedout variants of the new machines. ASUS added intelligent cooling to several new models including the Zephyrus M16 and Strix models in 16inch and 18inch variants. The company accomplished this using a fullwidth heatsink spanning the devices rear. ASUS also added a third cooling fan to more models. It was first seen in the Flow X16 from 2022. That extra fan improves airflow to the GPU and other internal hardware. The Strix SCAR line which ASUS calls the performance flagships have bigger 16 and 18inch screens than their 15 and 17inch predecessors including Nebula HDR in the most expensive tiers. In addition ASUS says this years cooling improvements let these models push higher frame rates. Meanwhile the Strix G16 and G18 are slightly less highend likely cheaper equivalents to the Strix 16 and 18 with the same CPU and GPU options. ASUS is also updating its lightandthin Zephyrus line. The ROG Zephyrus M16 has a Nebula HDR display. Like several other models topshelf models include a MUX Switch and NVIDIA Advanced Optimus. They bypass the machines integrated graphics using discrete graphics almost instantaneously. The fullwidth heatsink and trifan tech also let it run 25 watts higher than the 2022 version. Meanwhile the Zephyrus G16 has the same processor and graphics options with a QHD Nebula display that supports 240Hz. Its smaller sibling the Zephyrus G14 gets a Nebula HDR panel with 504 dimming zones and 600 nits of peak brightness. ASUS Duo 16 is the latest iteration of its quirky dualscreen laptop line. Like the 2022 model the updated version has a 16inch Mini LED panel as its main screen with a smaller 4K display below for multitasking. It also joins other models in offering the new NVIDIA graphics and MUX Switch in the highestend models. The company also updated the ROG Flow its 2in1 tablet PCs for gamers. The Flow X13 which has a 360degree rotating hinge has a 13inch Nebula display supporting a 165Hz refresh rate. Additionally ASUS redesigned its chassis making it 10mm smaller and increasing its battery capacity from 62 to 75 Wh while maintaining the same keyboard layout. The company also made its touchpad bigger and redesigned the 2in1 hinge with better ventilation and an easier grip. The X13s larger companion the Flow X16 has an HDR Mini LED touchscreen with a 240Hz refresh rate and 1100 nits peak brightness. In addition all ASUS 2023 Flow devices use Cornings Gorilla Glass DXC which can increase hardness by 40 percent and reduce glare. Meanwhile the Flow Z13 a detachable thats like a Microsoft Surface for gamers is updated with the new Intel and NVIDIA components and a QHD Nebula display with a 165Hz refresh rate.,2023-01-03T19:00:25Z

It looks pretty similar to the companys previous Freestyle model but this one includes Samsungs smart TV platform and features its Gaming Hub as well. This also provides access to services such as Xbox Cloud Gaming Amazon Luna and NVIDIA GeForce Now for cloud gaming. However the real magic with this years version of Freestyle may become apparent when you have two units. When projections from the two become one as the Spice Girls might have once sang Edge Blending tech can combine them into a single ultrawide display with a 219 aspect ratio. Samsung says the patented technology can automatically keystone the picture and make adjustments for an even more immersive cinematic experience. So if you have a living room with an enormous wall or happen to know a friend with an art gallery you may be able to set up two Freestyle projectors and play Fortnite on a massive display.

At CES 2023 this week the company revealed the Flex Hybrid OLED mobile screen. It folds from one side and slides out the other. This combination not only increases the size but alters the aspect ratio too. Starting off at a relatively compact 4. 2inch device it folds out to a 10. 5inch 43 display. Then because its not done the right side slides and expands out to create a 12. 4inch display with a 1610 aspect ratio which seems like itd be ideal for watching TV and movies. Samsungs folding phones won me over in 2022 even if they could do with longer battery life. With a screen this big that has to be a major consideration for any realworld devices. Weve seen rollout displays on concept phones before. TCL teased such a device in 2021 but it never showed off a working prototype. If Samsung has one at CES well check it out when the show floor opens. Already weve been barraged by PC and TV announcements. Keep track of all the news from CES 2023 right here.

NVIDIA finally unveiled its latest midrange GPU the RTX 4070 Ti. Starting at 799 its a slightly more reasonable alternative to NVIDIAs 1199 RTX 4090 and 1599 4090. But yes its still pretty costly. Is this the new GPU midrange NVIDIA is positioning the RTX 4070 Ti as the pinnacle of 1440p gaming beyond 120 fps. DLSS 3 is a big reason for that just like with the other 4000series cards it uses machine learning to generate entire frames rather than the pixels DLSS 2 created. That means it should be able to deliver better overall frame rates. The RTX 4070 Ti will be available on January 5th. Apple is raising the price of battery replacements for older iPhones It already costs more to give newer iPhones a fresh battery. Apple is adding 20 to the price of battery replacements for preiPhone 14 models on March 1st. For notched iPhones iPhone X through iPhone 13 this will bump the price from 69 to 89. If you have an iPhone SE or iPhone 8 the price will climb from 49 to 69. Its not clear if selfrepair prices will increase at the same time. However part prices roughly equal the cost of asking Apple to perform a battery swap. The company didnt elaborate on the reasoning but last year said inflation had affected business and it raised iPhone prices in several international markets.

From dualscreen devices to 18inch gaming behemoths this years show has us excited for whats coming next. Intel AMD and Nvidia make their big mobile chip announcements at CES and this year was no different. And once those announcements are made the PC makers follow with the laptops that those processors will be featured in. Most new models with Intels 13thgen Core or AMDs Ryzen 7000 series CPUs and Nvidias GeForce RTX 40 series or AMDs Radeon RX 7000 series GPUs wont be available until spring at the earliest.

Asus even launched the first laptop with a glassesfree 3D display. Whether you care most about gaming or content creation or just getting work done CES 2023 had something for everyone. ProArt Studiobook 16 3D OLEDVivobook Pro 16X 3D OLED Most of Asus CES laptop announcements featured one key ingredient an OLED display. That includes the upcoming release of the worlds first 3D OLED. The 3D is generated via a layer of lenticular lenses bonded to the panel to refract the emitted light to different eyes. That means you get 3D without the glasses.

Instead of basic black or gray LG gave the Style which will come in 14 and 16inch sizes a glasscovered iridescent treatment. Also LG did away with a traditional trackpad and instead put a haptics touchpad in the area below the keyboard. But unlike other haptic touchpads like those on MacBooks theres no artificial outline for the touch area its just flat metal all the way across.

10,Nvidia unveils GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for laptops,Nvidia unveiled the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti graphics card using its latest graphics processing unit (GPU) chip.,https://venturebeat.com/games/nvidia-unveils-geforce-rtx-40-series-gpus-for-laptops/,Nvidia unveiled the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti graphics card using its latest graphics processing unit GPU chip. It also showed off laptops with a whole family of 40 Series GPUs. The 4070 desktop GPU will sell for 800 and will be available on January 5 for custom addon boards. The Santa Clara Californiabased company said the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is faster than the predecessor GeForce RTX 3090 Ti at nearly half the power thanks to its new Nvidia Ada Lovelace architecture innovations and Nvidia DLSS 3 deep learning super sampling technology. The GPUs are part of the 40 Series family that the company began introducing last fall and they will compete against the latest offerings from Advanced Micro Devices Radeon GPU family. Nvidia made the announcement at an online event ahead of the CES 2023 tech trade show in Las Vegas. Nvidia said that the GPUs will be built into more than 170 laptop models. The laptops use the new 4070 4060 and 4050 GPUs from Nvidia. And 4090 and 4080based laptops will start shipping for 2000 on February 8. Other 40 Series RTX laptops 40506070 starting at 1000 will start shipping on February 22. Nvidia said the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti will max out a 1440p monitor delivering over 120 FPS in modern games like A Plague Tale Requiem Warhammer 40000 Darktide and F1 22. Nvidia showed off a bunch of games that will take advantage of the hardware. Other titles that will use RTXs ray tracing include Cyberpunk 2077 Portal with RTX The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and many more. Jeff Fisher senior vice president of gaming at Nvidia said in the press event that gaming added 20 million new PC gamers in 2022 and 100 million since 2019. Steam hit a new peak of 32 million up 16 from 2021 while esports viewing was up 40 from the prior year he said. He noted Call of Duty Modern Warfare II hit 800 million in revenues in its opening weekend. He said the Ada Lovelace architecture launched last fall with the 4090 GPUs represented a quantum leap in PC gaming with more shader cores RT cores and Tensor cores. He showed off Witchfire a new dark fantasy firstperson shooter coming soon from The Astronaut for the PC. And he displayed Warhaven a new PC title coming from Nexon. And he showed off the coollooking Atomic Heart coming on multiple platforms from Focus Entertainment and 4Divinity. The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is targeted at gamers who play at the midrange or 1440p graphics. The GPU has 7680 CUDA Cores and 12 GB of superfast GDDR6X memory. For users with a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti or GeForce RTX 2080 the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti offers a tremendous upgrade Nvidia said. It delivers up to 12 times relative performance over the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. Nvidia DLSS uses AI to figure out the pixels that need to be displayed on a screen and more than 250 gaming and creative apps use it now. Fifty current and upcoming games are using DLSS 3. 0 which doubles the framerate of a game. AI will define the future of computing and this has influenced much of what were covering today said Fisher. AI will change gaming forever. In addition to running faster than the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti uses 43 less power on average while gaming just 226 watts versus the 3090 Tis 398 watts. And while idle web browsing or watching videos its power usage barely registers thanks to architectural enhancements of the GeForce RTX 40 Series the company said. GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs enable live streamers and video editors to use AV1 the nextgeneration codec. Livestreamers will be able to push higher resolutions and frame rates with improved quality at the current max bit rates in popular streaming apps and platforms. GeForce RTX 4070 Ti GPUs enable streaming the latest PC games with RTX at up to 4K 60FPS and 1440p 120FPS with AV1 encoding. AV1 is also enabled in the top video editing apps including Adobe Premiere Pro via the Voukoder plugin DaVinci Resolve and Jianying the top video editing app in China. Along with the improved quality that AV1 delivers GeForce RTX 4070 Ti features dual eight generation Nvidia Encoders bringing video editors up to two times video export speed. 3D creators will see up to 70 increase in performance compared to the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti in the most popular apps like Blender Unity Unreal Engine and Chaos VRay. Every existing GeForce innovation and enhancement is also available for buyers of GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics cards including GSYNC GeForce Experience oneclick overclocking and game optimization Shadowplay recording and so much more. Starting on January 5 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti for desktops will be available from top addin card providers Asus Colorful Gainward Galax Gigabyte INNO3D KFA2 MSI Palit PNY and Zotac as well as from gaming system integrators and builders worldwide. The new GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops are up to three times more power efficient than the previous generation and bring the Ada architecture Nvidia DLSS 3 and fifthgeneration MaxQ technologies to laptops for the first time. For gamers RTX 40 Series laptops deliver up to four times the performance in tripleA games like full raytraced Cyberpunk 2077 with new RT Overdrive Mode the company said. With the Ada architecture we set out to transform the performance and power efficiency of gaming and creator laptops said Fisher. The new RTX 40 Series delivers enthusiastclass performance in laptops as slim as 14 inches a new milestone. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 laptops The Ada architecture has also enabled a new class of enthusiast laptops that are the worlds fastest the company said. Gamers can play on three 4K monitors for surround gaming at 60 frames per second enough to power a professionalgrade driving simulator. RTX 40 Series flagship laptops 4080 and 4090 start at 2000 and will be available beginning Feb. 8. RTX 4070 4060 4050 laptops The new RTX 4070 4060 and 4050 laptops are faster than the previousgeneration flagship model using as little as onethird the GPU power. They deliver 80 fps 1440p gaming and transform creation processes like rendering scenes in Blender which used to take two and a half hours to just 10 minutes. The RTX 4050 laptops start at 1000 and will be available beginning Feb. 22. FifthGeneration MaxQ Technologies improve laptop efficiency With each new GPU generation since 2017 advancements in MaxQ technology have improved laptop design. Today alongside the launch of the GeForce RTX 40 Series laptops Nvidia is introducing its fifthgeneration MaxQ technologies which radically enhance efficiency and accelerate gaming performance using the following upgrades Nvidia DLSS 3 has been optimized for laptops and built into MaxQ technologies including Whispermode and BatteryBoost which improve performance acoustics and battery life by up to two times. The lowest voltage GDDR6 memory ever shipped in partnership with multiple manufacturers. Trispeed memory control enables the GPU to switch to newer lowerpower memory states dynamically. Adas onchip memory has been optimized for MaxQ doubling the bandwidth increasing the size by 16 times and improving clock gating. 14Inch laptops more powerful Before the introduction of the Ada architecture 95 of this fastestgrowing laptop segment was limited to basic tasks and apps Nvidia said. More than 13 million were sold last year Fisher said. Now the company said 14inch laptops can take on tasks that were previously impossible such as fast 3D rendering in Blender and cuttingedge AI tools in popular apps like Adobe Photoshop or Premiere Pro. The 14inch laptops are also gaming powerhouses up to twice as fast as a PlayStation 5 but onesixth the size. Gamers can play graphically intense tripleA games like Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing and DLSS. Purposebuilt for 110 million creators The creator market continues to grow rapidly surpassing more than 110 million professional and hobbyist PC creators. And 3D creation on Nvidia hardware specifically grew 42 since last year the company said. GeForce RTX laptop users can benefit from Nvidia Studio accelerations in over 110 of the most popular creative apps plus exclusive access to AIpowered apps like Nvidia Omniverse Canvas and Broadcast. 3D artists can collaborate with one another in Omniverse from anywhere in the world while video editors can produce on location faster with AI tools and cut export times in half with dual encoders. Creating has grown beyond photos and videos to virtual worlds rendered with 3D cinematic graphics and truetolife physics Fisher said. The RTX platform is powering this growth. Stephanie Johnson vice president of studio and gaming at Nvidia said in a press briefing that AI is transforming the work of the 110 million creators in the market and Nvidia Studio has 110 apps that make life easier for those creators. Nvidia enabled the mod Portal Prelude for its RTX Remix tool. The modding community cant wait to get their hands on Remix Johnson said. She said 90 of internet videos run at 1080p or lower but half of RTX users have higher resolution monitors. RTX video superresolution can remove blocky compression and upscale video resolution starting this February with 30 Series and 40 Series GPUs. GeForce RTX 40 Series flagship laptops will be available starting Feb. 8 from the worlds top manufacturers including Acer Alienware Asus Dell Gigabyte HP Lenovo MSI Razer and Samsung. They will also be available from local makers and system builders including CyberPower PC Eluktronics Hasee PC Specialist 3XS by Scan and Schenker with more coming in Q1.

11,Nvidia boosts generative AI for biology with BioNeMo,Nvidia and Evozyne announced BioNeMo helped build a new generative AI model that could help improve human health as well as climate change.,https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-boosts-generative-ai-for-biology-with-bionemo/,In September 2022 Nvidia announced the launch of its BioNeMo Large Language Model LLM service to help researchers build new artificial intelligence AI models for biology and its an effort that has yielded some strong early results. Today Nvidia along with biotech startup Evozyne are announcing that BioNeMo was used to help build a new generative AI model that could have a significant impact on helping improve human health as well as climate change. The generative AI model was used to create a pair of new proteins that are being detailed today. One of the proteins could one day be used to reduce carbon dioxide while the other might help to cure congenital diseases. Proteins are the building blocks of life Kimberly Powell VP of healthcare at Nvidia said during a press briefing. The field of protein engineering looks to discover new proteins that can help us design more effective drugs remove carbon from the air or make more environmentally friendly clothes. Generative AI is leading a revolution for healthcare While generative AI has become a popular topic for discussion in recent months thanks to the popularity of services like ChatGPG its application in the life sciences field is nothing short of revolutionary. Event Intelligent Security Summit OnDemand Learn the critical role of AI ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies. Watch ondemand sessions today. Earlier this week life science vendor Absci announced that it has built a generative AI model using E. coli bacteria that can create entirely new antibody drugs. IBM has developed an opensource library called Generative Toolkit for Scientific Discovery GT4SD to help advance efforts as well. Using generative AI to accelerate drug discovery is likely to be a major trend in 2023 overall as researchers look to reduce the time it takes to create new treatments. Using Nvidia BioNeMo for generative AI The Nvidia BioNeMo LLM is a model designed to help enable drug discovery. With generative AI which uses large language models as a base new things can be created based on data that the model has already been trained on. Powell explained that the number of potential proteins far exceeds the number of particles in the universe. So in order to accelerate the discovery process Evozyne and Nvidia used Nvidia BioNeMo to create the ProtVAE model for protein discovery in just a few weeks. She said that Evozyne used BioNeMo to finetune ProtVAE for a specific protein family. Once it was finetuned the new model has been used to generate an entirely new library of proteins that maintain or enhance a function in a specific family class of proteins. This model was able to invent proteins never before seen in nature Powell said. This is the capability that is going to be how we can explore the infinite universe of proteins to discover new therapies in materials energy sources and sustainable foods. VentureBeats mission is to be a digital town square for technical decisionmakers to gain knowledge about transformative enterprise technology and transact.

Depending on how you spec them though the likes of Elden Ring should still look pretty great on these laptops. First up is the latest Zenbook Pro 16X OLED which ASUS says is the most powerful Zenbook to date. Youll be able to kit it out with up to a 13thgen Intel Core processor NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40series laptop GPU and 32GB of LPDDR5X DRAM. ASUS says the Zenbook Pro 16X OLED UX7602BZ has a unique Intel processor and a Supernova SystemonModule design that reduces the size of the motherboard core area by 38 percent allowing for more efficient cooling. Theres also more space for the graphics units power components which ASUS says will deliver higher and more stable GPU performance. As the name suggests this model has an OLED display. Its a 16inch 3. 2K HDR touchscreen with an aspect ratio of 1610 and a 120Hz refresh rate. Theres an autotilting keyboard that could help you to find the ideal typing angle. Youll also be able to take advantage of the ASUS Dial which should offer more precise control in creativityfocused apps. The Zenbook Pro 14 OLED is getting a glow up too. The UX6404 model has a 2. 8K 120Hz NanoEdge Dolby Vision display with a 100 percent DCIP3 gamut and Pantone validation for accurate colors. It comes with up to a 13thgen Intel Core processor a GeForce RTX 40series laptop GPU a 2TB SSD and 16GB of DDR5 RAM. Theres a memory slot that can accommodate up to 32GB SODIMM as well as WiFi 6E connectivity and a 76Wh battery. ASUS says it packed all of this into a body that weighs 3. 64 lbs 1. 65 kg and is less than 0. 7 inches 1. 8 cm thick. As for the Zenbook 14X OLED UX3404 that has a 14. 5inch 2. 8K HDR display with a 1610 aspect ratio and 120Hz refresh rate. The laptop comes with up to a 13thgen Intel Core processor GeForce RTX 3050 GPU 32GB of LPDDR5 RAM a 1TB PCIe 4. 0 SSD and a 70Wh battery. The thin and light 14X comes in two colors Inkwell Gray and Sandstone Beige. The latter has a lid with what ASUS describes as a new ecofriendly Plasma Ceramization coating technique that creates a ceramiclike finish and stonelike feel. Meanwhile the businessoriented ExpertBook B9 OLED B9403CVA is an allmetal laptop. The company claims the ecofriendly manufacturing process helps to reduce production materials by up to 29 percent and shortens manufacturing time by up to 75 percent to maximize energy efficiency. Its said to be lighter than most 13inch laptops too. The latest ExpertBook B9 has a 14inch 2. 8K display with a 90 percent screentobody ratio. Theres a touchpad thats almost 27 percent larger than the previous model and you can expect a raft of security features including NFC login face login and a physical webcam shutter. ASUS hasnt revealed pricing for any of these models as yet. The laptops should start shipping between April and June.,2023-01-04T19:00:25Z

But for 2023 in addition to revamped specs ASUS is trying out a fancy new ceramic coating on the laptops lid. The process used to create the coating is called PEO or plasma electrolytic oxidation. This allows ASUS to add a lightweight but durable finish thats not only harder than traditional anodized aluminum because it doesnt require any strong acids or heavy metals during manufacturing its also more environmentally friendly. In person the Zenbook 14Xs ceramic finish feels great. It reminds me of the magnesium chassis Microsoft used on old Surfaces except that its even smoother and better at resisting fingerprints. The downside is that because this is the first time ASUS is using this process the ceramic coating is only available in one color sandstone. On the bright side if you want something a bit more traditional theres also a cheaper model with an aluminum finish in Inkwell gray. Other updates on the Zenbook 14X include a slightly larger 14. 5inch OLED touchscreen a faster 120Hz refresh rate and a taller 1610 aspect ratio. And of course performance is also getting a bump thanks to new 13thgen Intel CPUs support for up to 32GB of DDR5 RAM and even an optional RTX 3050 GPU from NVIDIA. ASUS is also adding faster WiFi 6E connectivity and with a slightly larger 70watt hour battery Im hoping we see a small boost in longevity too. Port selection looks solid as well with two Thunderbolt 4 connectors. And when it comes to making video calls theres a new full HD webcam which is up from the 720p on last years model with support for windows hello and dual mics with AI noise cancellation so you should look and sound better during meetings. Now I know some of you might be disappointed that ASUS didnt find room for Nvidias newest 40series mobile graphics cards. But considering that the Zenbook 14X weighs barely more than four pounds and isnt meant to be your main gaming machine its hard to be too upset. All told between the new ceramic coating the slightly larger display and revamped components the Zenbook 14X is shaping up to be a pretty wellequipped and stylish notebook. I just hope other people like it too because Id love to see ASUS expand the color options for the ceramic coating to more shades than just sandstone. Of course just how much of a premium you have to pay for it may play a role in its success. ASUS has not yet released pricing for the Zenbook 14X OLED though it is slated to go on sale sometime in Q2 2023.,2023-01-04T19:00:16Z
14,Razer rounds out its laptop line with the high-spec Blade 16 and Blade 18,"Razer is no stranger to making high-performance gaming laptops. But with the arrival of 13th-gen CPUs from Intel

But with the arrival of 13thgen CPUs from Intel and 40series mobile GPUs from NVIDIA it really feels like the company is trying to cram as much power as it possibly can in its new Blade 16 and Blade 18 notebooks. Starting with the Blade 16 you get a huge range of beefy components including up to Intel Corei9 HX chips and NVIDIAs topoftheline RTX 4090 graphics cards. On top of that while some other laptop makers sometimes try to limit the power consumption of a laptops GPU in order to preserve battery life Razer is throwing caution to the wind and will support a total graphics power TGP of 175 watts. Interestingly despite going big on performance the Blade 16 isnt that much larger than the Blade 15 with an increase in thickness of just 5mm 21. 99mm for the Blade 16 vs. 16. 99 for the Blade 15. The Blade 16 is also almost exactly the same width as its smaller sibling and less than half an inch deeper as well so theres not a huge increase in overall size despite the big jump in performance. And weighing 5. 4 pounds the Blade 16 isnt overly heavy either. That said my favorite new feature on the Blade 16 which isnt available on the larger Blade 18 is a dualmode 1610 mini LED display that supports two different native refresh rates and resolutions 4K at 120Hz or FHD at 240Hz. This choice of display modes is really handy because it lets you adjust your screen depending on what youre doing. If youre editing photos or videos you can set the screen to 120Hz at 4K in order to view your content at full resolution while also boosting peak brightness to a stunning 1000 nits. Then when you feel like winding down with a game or two you can set the display to operate in FH240Hz mode so you can take full advantage of the laptops performance. The downside is that peak brightness at 240Hz drops slightly to 600 nits though from what I saw thats still more than enough to support vivid HDR graphics. The other minor annoyance is that when you want to switch between different display modes on the Blade you will need to fully shut down and restart the system which just feels clunky. Next we move onto the Blade 18 which Razer says is simply the most powerful laptop the company has ever made. In addition to topnotch components the Blade 18 sports a gorgeous 240Hz QHD display along with a new 5MP webcam so you can live stream in high resolution without needing to plug in an external one. Also as Razers biggest and brawniest desktop replacement the Blade 18 also comes with a booming sixspeaker setup that supports THX spatial audio. And just like the Blade 16 this system offers a great selection of ports including multiple USBC jacks with Thunderbolt 4 a fullsize SD card reader HDMI 2. 1 and even an Ethernet jack which is the one port not available on the Blade 16. Unfortunately the biggest hurdle for anyone considering buying either of these systems is their price The Blade 16 starts at 2700 while the cheapest Blade 18 will go for 2900 with both models quickly moving well above 3500 when fully maxed out. Personally as much as I like the idea of a laptop thats more powerful than my midtower at home the Blade 18 is still a bit too large for my taste. But for those who need highend systems with sleek aluminum builds and have cash to burn it really feels like Razers latest addition to the Blade family are gaming laptops in a class of their own. Both systems are expected to go on sale some in Q1 2023.,2023-01-05T18:00:43Z

Some may find this model a bit more palatable than the 55inch Odyssey Ark Samsung released last year as its an ultrawide with a ratio of 329 the Ark is a 169 display. Sure you might need to turn your head to fully take in Zeta Halo while playing Halo Infinite or see all the apps you have open but it might feel more immersive and be more comfortable to use as an upclose monitor than the Odyssey Ark. Just dont expect to use the Neo G9 in a vertical orientation. The latest Neo G9 which Samsung started teasing in November has an 8K display with a resolution of 7860 x 2160 pixels. Samsung claims its the first dual UHD miniLED monitor. It has a 10000001 contrast ratio and HDR 1000 support along with a matte display to absorb light and minimize glare. The Neo G9 may be a viable option for highperformance gaming given its 240Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time. In addition Samsung says its the first gaming monitor with DisplayPort 2. 1 connectivity as well. The company will reveal more details later including the allimportant price. Samsung has other displays to talk about at CES this year including its first curved OLED gaming monitors. It announced the Odyssey G8 OLED at IFA last year. The 34inch 219 display has a resolution of 3440 x 1440 and a 175Hz refresh rate. Samsung has already started selling it in some markets and says it will be available in the US very soon. The company has now revealed a 49inch curved OLED gaming monitor with many of the same features as the Odyssey G8. Both have a 1ms response time a 3. 6mm thick design and a screen curvature of 1800R along with adaptive sync and AMD FreeSync Premium to minimize screen tearing. They each have a Neo Quantum Processor that Samsung claims can deliver brighter whites deeper blacks and nearinfinite color contrast as well as HDR True Black 400. In terms of ports youll find MiniDisplayPort HDMI and USBC with the latter offering up to 65W charging. Both monitors include the Samsung Gaming Hub with access to cloud gaming services such as Xbox Cloud Gaming and NVIDIA GeForce Now.

Elsewhere theres a new version of the Smart Monitor with support for video streaming and cloud gaming services as well as Microsoft 365 apps and a SmartThings hub. The Smart Monitor M80C is a 32inch 4K 169 display with a detachable SlimFit Camera. Whats new in the latest model is a personalization feature named My Contents. This will show the weather photos schedules and more on the ambient display. The personalized content will only be shown when a connected device is within Bluetooth range. Samsung also announced its first 5K monitor which is geared toward creatives. The 27inch ViewFinity S9 has a resolution of 5120 x 2880 a wide color gamut of 99 percent DCIP3 and HDR 600 support. The idea is to provide users with detailed clear and clean images. In addition theres a matte display detachable 4K camera and HDMI DisplayPort and USBC ports. Youll be able to calibrate the ViewFinity S9 with the help of the SmartThingsApp and a smartphone camera.,2023-01-02T15:00:46Z

17,1 Stock That Proves You Shouldn't Buy What You Know,"Chip stock NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is highly popular among investors. However, the company is facing demand softness in China and export restrictions. Demand for GPUs from the gaming industry has...",https://stocknews.com/news/nvda-umc-stm-aeis-1-stock-that-proves-you-shouldnt-buy-what-you-know/,Chip designer and computing major NVIDIA Corporation NVDA reported higherthanexpected revenues in the third quarter on the back of solid demand in its data center business. Its revenue was 1. 9 above analyst estimates. The companys EPS was 17. 6 below the consensus estimate. Its gross margin fell 11. 6 percentage points to 53. 6. Data center revenue grew 31 yearoveryear while gaming revenue declined 51 from the prioryear period. The companys revenue was hit due to soft demand from China and the U. S. governments ban on the export of GPUs A100 and H100. To counter the financial loss from the ban the company unveiled the A800 GPU which would be an alternative to the A100. The A800 complies with the export control rules and it helped NVDA lessen the financial implication of the ban. After the pandemicinduced rise in gaming NVDAs gaming segment suffered in the third quarter due to the lower GPU sales for desktops and laptops. Moreover with the severe decline in crypto mining the demand for its GPU chips has slowed down. With many analysts expecting an extended crypto winter NVDAs demand from the crypto market could take a hit. For the fiscal fourth quarter ended December 31 2022 NVDA expects its revenue to be 6 billion plus or minus 2 compared to analyst expectations of 6. 09 billion. NVDAs stock has gained 14. 4 over the past three months. On the other hand it has declined 52. 5 in price over the past year to close the last trading session at 143. 15. Heres what could influence NVDAs performance in the upcoming months Disappointing Financials NVDAs revenue declined 16. 5 yearoveryear to 5. 93 billion for the third quarter ended October 30 2022.

19,You're Gonna Need a Bigger Desk: Samsung's New Gaming Monitor Is a Beast - CNET,"Samsung brought a 57-inch curved high-res display, a 49-inch QD-OLED and some smaller fry to CES 2023.",https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/youre-gonna-need-a-bigger-desk-samsungs-new-gaming-monitor-is-a-beast/,CES is when gamingmonitor companies bring out the big guns and few are bigger than the new 57inch Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 a curved DisplayHDR 1000 model. Teased by AMD during its RX 7000series GPU launch in November as the first monitor announced with DisplayPort 2. 1 support the Neo G9 has 7680x2160pixel resolution. The high resolution plus HDR and fast 240Hz refresh rate make the highbandwidth DP 2. 1 essential even though its not a full 8K its a 329 aspect ratio. However theres still a bit of a disconnect between this level of resolution and GPU performance. At the moment the only GPU that can handle it with all the frills is probably the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 but Nvidia hasnt leveled up to DP 2. 1 HDMI 2. 1 can support it but only at 60Hz. AMDs RX 7900 XTX does have DP2. 1 connections but isnt quite up to that level or might be but just under limited circumstances. Its slated to ship later this year but we dont know how much this bad boy is going to cost. Read More CES 2023 Watch Every Announcements from Samsung LG Nvidia The 49inch Odyssey OLED G9 G95SC isnt the companys first Quantum Dot OLED monitor announcement it unveiled a 34inch G8 model similar to the Alienware 34 QDOLED at IFA in August which was supposed to ship by the end of 2022 but thats been bumped to very soon. In addition to the QDOLED panel the G9 has 5120x1440pixel resolution essentially 329ratio 1440p but with a better pixel density than the typical 219 3440x1440 and is DisplayHDR True Black 400 certified. It also has a fasterthanAlienware 240Hz refresh rate and incorporates Samsungs Gaming Hub for cloud gaming. Samsung opted to go with mini DisplayPort instead of fullsize DisplayPort for this model in addition to HDMI and USBC with 65watt power delivery. Samsung expects to ship it later this year and has yet to give us pricing. A little more mundane if you consider 43inch monitors have reached that level of commonplace the flat Odyssey Neo G7 goes a little sleeker and more gamingslashentertainment hybrid than its predecessors. The 144Hz Quantum Dot DisplayHDR 600compliant monitor has integrated stereo speakers and comes with a remote and all the streamingandgaming apps Samsungs Hubs can include. Its scheduled to ship by the end of March in the US for an as yet unspecified number of dollars.,2023-01-04T19:01:50Z
20,Yearning for a Bigger Gaming Laptop Display? Acer's About to Make You Very Happy - CNET,"Acer is going big at CES 2023, with 16- and 18-inch Predator Helios gaming laptops.",https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/yearning-for-a-bigger-gaming-laptop-display-acers-about-to-make-you-very-happy/,A lot of gamers will be pleased with whats coming in 2023 from Acer. The new 16 and 18inch Predator Helios gaming laptops announced Tuesday at CES 2023 feature the latest 13thgen Intel Core processors Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series graphics enhanced cooling beautiful big displays and a whole lot of lights. Read more CES 2023 How to Watch the Biggest Announcements from Samsung LG Nvidia Predator Helios is a premium gaming line so Acer will offer the best in new components inside. Along with the latest Intel and Nvidia options theyll support up to 32GB of DDR54800 RAM and up to 2TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe solidstate drives in RAID 0. The components will be kept cool with dual customengineered fifthgen AeroBlade 3D metal fans and vector heat pipes in the shape of rectangles for improved heat transfer Acer said in its announcement. The Helios 16 will come with three 2560x1600pixel display options with a 165Hz or 240Hz refresh rate or a Mini LED panel with a 250Hz refresh rate 100 P3 color gamut and a peak brightness over 1000 nits. The 18inch Helios has those panel options as well as an entrylevel 1920x1200pixel display at 165Hz. The new designs use a miniLED backlit keyboard with deep 1. 8millimeter key travel. The perkey lighting uses less power while giving the keys bright uniform color. A customizable RGB light bar also runs across the top of the back vents. The Predator Helios 16 is expected in March starting at 1650 with the Helios 18 following in April with a starting price of 1700. Both laptops are expected to be available in Europe a month earlier than in the US though. Pricing for the UK and Australia wasnt immediately available but the price for the Helio 16 converts to approximately 1370 or AU2445.

21,The Razer Blade 16 Doesn't Make You Choose Between 4K and a High FPS,"Normally, when you buy a gaming laptop, you have to make a choice.

Th…",https://gizmodo.com/razer-blade-16-4k-high-fps-mini-led-nvidia-rtx-price-1849952313,Normally when you buy a gaming laptop you have to make a choice. Do you want a high resolution for pretty visuals or a high frame rate for smooth gameplay Most of the time you can only choose one with some middle ground in the 1440p and 120Hz area. The new Razer Blade 16 with its dualmode miniLED display is getting rid of that choice for you. The laptop which launches in Q1 of this year for a not insignificant starting price of 2699 is at least doing its best to keep you from getting buyers remorse. Regardless of the model you pick youll be able to press a button to swap the display between Creator Mode and a Gamer Mode. The Creator Mode swaps your laptop over to a 4K resolution The representing the small number of extra pixels it has to hit its 1610 aspect ratio with a 120Hz refresh rate while the Gamer Mode sets your laptop to an FHD resolution with a 240Hz refresh rate. Your current laptop can swap resolutions and potentially even refresh rates yes. But most 4K laptops dont have the option to hit refresh rates as high as 240Hz even if you lower the resolution. The panel focusing on supporting 4K just cant do that. Now giving yourself the option of fidelity doesnt preclude you from hitting a high fps when youd prefer to lower the quality in exchange for extra smooth animation. Razer hasnt been entirely clear with me about how this works and I assume Ill get more details on that closer to launch as well as an opportunity to test it out myself. What I do know now is that the laptops poised to be as powerful as youd expect from Razer with Intel Core HX CPUs and Nvidias new mobile GPUs. Anecdotally I played a racing sim at a meeting with Nvidia at CES that ran three 4K displays off a single RTX 4090 Razer Blade 16 and I easily would have thought I was playing off a desktop if I hadnt known. I also saw Cyberpunk 2077 running at 121 fps on an RTX 4070 Ti Razer Blade 16 with its power artificially restricted to 30 less than what a neighboring RTX 3090 Ti equipped system was pullingsaid system was only hitting 80 fps. Its always wise to take such demos with a grain of salt since theyre specifically tailored to show the systems in their best lights and may not take them through the most demanding tasks. Were excited to review this system later this year.,2023-01-05T18:00:00Z
22,Asus Gaming Laptops Overwhelm with 2023 Updates - CNET,Even the most basic refreshes announced at CES have some useful enhancements.,https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/asus-gaming-laptops-overwhelm-with-2023-updates/,Asus CES gaming laptop announcements seem to touch every single model in its portfolio and include 2023s biggest gaming hardware trend so far an 18inch gaming laptop. Yes there are also the usual everythingisupdatedto2023generation components like Intel 13thgen H and HXseries processors and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40series GPUs as well as nextgen AMD CPUs and GPUs which were expecting to hear about during the keynote on Wednesday night Jan. 4. The company has announced a couple of interesting gaming monitors as well. Screen updates abound there are lots of 240Hz 1440p displays with smaller bezels and 1610 aspect ratios which youll see everywhere in gaming laptops and youll see 15 and 17inch models swapped out for 16 and 18inch ones which is another big trend at the show. The actual physical redesigns are modest so dont look for an allver new look just new components and features. Optimized for Optimus My fave new feature is the rollout of Nvidia Advanced Optimus support across all Asus gaming laptops with Nvidia GPUs or at least most of them. Thats the technology that enables the laptop screen to switch between operating on the discrete GPU or the integrated GPU without forcing you to reboot and which finally lets the laptop display use GSync. Its potentially a big energy efficiency and battery life saver. Asus ROG Nebula HDR displays available on the Zephyrus M16 Zephyrus G14 Strix Scar 16 and Flow X16 have double the mini LED backlight zones 1024. Theyre DisplayHDR 1000compliant screens with a peak brightness of 1100 nits. They have larger heatsinks too because that level of brightness can get hot. As mentioned above theyre 1440p 240Hz plus 100 P3 gamut coverage. One exception is the Nebula HDR screen in the Zephyrus G14 which is a dimmer DisplayHDR 600. The 3ms pixel refresh isnt stellar though. Asus also has an external GPU box called the XG Mobile. It works with systems like the 13inch Flow X13 and Flow Z13 laptops and the 16inch Flow X16 adding extra graphics power. That XG Mobile previously contained an Nvidia RTX 3080 GPU and this year itll get bumped up to a newer 40series RTX GPU. Thatll help this expensive addon feel like a better longterm investment. AMD isnt getting left out. theres a new model that highlights all the latest and greatest technology on offer from that company called the TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition. Its one of the few laptops incorporating an AMD GPU which is up to generation RDNA 3 this year. Sadly the MUX switch a clunky way to toggle between the discrete and integrated GPU lives on here. Its not as elegant a solution as Optimus nor does it have Thunderbolt 4 support it does have USB 4 because thats still an Intel thing. There are a few other AMD CPUbased models as well and several of the new gaming laptops including the 16inch Zephyrus models have newer sixspeaker arrays. Perhaps more importantly many of the ROG offerings have been finally upgraded to 1080p webcams which is something we should expect from every laptop now. We dont have any pricing yet but they all seem to be slated for Q2 shipping.,2023-01-03T22:49:52Z

Lets get all the nitty gritty out the way first. By now you should be familiar with Nvidias rebranding switch from RTX 4080 to RTX 4070 Ti. The card as such features the AD104 GPU and specs between all three MSI variants remain largely the same save for boost frequencies. The most frugal GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU to date carries a 285W TDP all powered through a single 16pin cable and should be ideal for powerefficient builds requiring only a recommended 600W PSU. Back onto clock speeds for the interim the base clock remains the same across all MSI cards at 2310MHz rising to 2625MHz for the Ventus 3X 2760MHz for Gaming X Trio and 2790Mhz for Suprim X. 12GB of GDDR6X is attached via a 192bit memory bus and clocked at a default 21Gbps resulting in 504GBs bandwidth. Suprim Series MSIs most premium model the Suprim is synonymous for its geometric design cues featuring brushed aluminium on the exterior and an armourlike aesthetic that envelops both the front and rear back plate. This often makes it a highly sought after card due to its more mature and modern appeal. Subtle RGB accent lighting is present on the face ideal for those who love a vertically mounted graphics card and those choosing a more traditional installation will be greeted to an RGBemblazoned MSI logo and text alongside the obligatory GeForce RTX branding. All customisable through Mystic Light of course. Though lavishly constructed Suprim is undoubtedly a thicc boi measuring threeandahalf slots wide. The cooler features seven core heat pipes that run through a massive nickelplated heatsink and copper baseplate and at first glance dimensions appear similar to 4080 and 4090 models. Gaming Trio Series Opting for a if it aint broke dont fix it approach this looks eerily similar to the previous renditions of MSIs Gaming Trio Series save for a few subtle changes that you would most likely miss if it wasnt pointed out. You can expect the same excellent cooling performance except the nickel plated heatsink now houses six heatpipes instead of the aforementioned seven when compared to its Suprim sibling. The overall design is best suited for a more gamer aesthetic featuring a trio of RGB accent lights slashed across the centred fan that give it an edgy appeal without feeling over done. As before Mystic Lighting handles all the exterior RGB lighting to ensure synchronicity with all you RGBinfused components. Ventus Series At the bottom of the stack where RTX 4070 Ti makes most sense the Ventus is well known for its budgetfriendly approach. Delivering a nothrills card its the closest to stock in terms of specs and thats not necessarily a bad thing considering the fact that the Ventus measures in at 2. 5 slots in terms of width which makes it an ideal card for compact builds. Theres no RGB accent lighting though some would see that as a plus and the trio of fans are from the previously used Torx Fan 4. 0 design whereas both the Suprim and Gaming Trio use updated Torx Fan 5. 0 variants which MSI touts as having improved airflow and static air pressure capabilities. Finally while the Gaming X Trio and Suprim X cards come kitted with a dual BIOS for silent and gaming mode operations the Ventus ships with a single BIOS as standard. It doesnt look nearly as impressive as its siblings but pricing ought to be much closer to MSRP. The trio of MSI cards are expected to be available starting January 5 with a suggested retail price of from 799. All eyes are now on retailers to see which cards if any manage to hit that target.,2023-01-04T16:30:00Z
24,It feels like Nvidia is gaslighting us with this ‘new’ GPU,Nvidia doesn't want you to remember that the RTX 4070 Ti isn't really a newly announced GPU.,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-relaunch-feels-like-gaslighting/,Nvidia announced a new GPU dubbed the RTX 4070 Ti via its broadcast ahead of CES 2023. Why the quotations around new you ask Well its not a new GPU at all actually but youd never know it by the way Nvidia GeForce head Jeff Fisher just talked about it. If you werent paying close attention to tech media news for the past few months youd think this was Nvidias fourth GPU in the new RTX 40series but no. Its just a new name for a product that was announced last year and then quickly retracted. In October of last year Nvidia did something unheard of in the tech industry. It unlaunched a recently announced product the RTX 4080 12GB. And that was Nvidias own language not mine mentioned in a quiet blog post with a total of five sentences most of which was spent on talking up the hype around the RTX 4090. And then the rumors starting building that the GPU would get rebranded as the RTX 4070 Ti which Nvidia seems to think would fix all the problems with this overpriced graphics card. Not only does it not magically make this thing a good value even at 100 cheaper but Nvidia just completely skipped over the fact that the RTX 4070 Ti is really just a rebrand. Again if you were watching this broadcast and perhaps missed the news about the unlaunch youd have no idea that this wasnt a brand new graphics card. Its like Nvidia wants us to just forget that all that unlaunching business ever happened or that it announced a GPU called the RTX 4080 12GB that just now materialized with a new name. Rather than come clean about what this new GPU really is Nvidia is trying to do mind wipe. It would have been great chance to poke fun at itself or just be honest about what exactly happened. Why not admit that the change was in response to feedback Tech enthusiasts and PC gamers love to hear that their opinions are heard. But no. Nvidia wants to play it cool and pretend like it didnt totally flub this product launch. At a time when its RTX 40series GPUs already have a pretty bad reputation gaslighting us wasnt the wisest choice here.

25,Nvidia brings the mighty RTX 4090 to laptops at CES 2023,"Laptop gamers, get ready -- Nvidia has just announced the upcoming release of its RTX 40-series mobile graphics cards.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-announces-rtx-40-mobile-gpus/,In huge news for laptop gamers Nvidias RTX 40series is coming to laptops and despite previous expectations the new lineup includes something for everyone. During its CES 2023 keynote Nvidia revealed that the full range of RTX 4000 cards is coming out. The list includes the RTX 4090 RTX 4080 RTX 4070 RTX 4060 and even the budget RTX 4050. Heres everything we know about Nvidias new laptop arsenal. Following the successful launch of the RTX 4090 and the RTX 4080 in 2022 Nvidia is now ready to reveal the mobile RTX 40 Ada lineup alongside the desktop RTX 4070 Ti. The company is trying a different strategy this time around because its set to cover a wider range of budgets with its mobile graphics cards. Nvidia splits its lineup into two sections mainstream and flagship. The RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 mobile both belong to the flagship sector. Nvidia promises 60 frames per second fps surround gaming at 4K the capability of 3D collaboration at seamless In the previous generation of This is most likely going to be one beefy GPU and were expecting to find it paired with the upcoming Intel Raptor Lake mobile flagship that powers some of the best gaming laptops of the year. Next we have the mobile version of the RTX 4080. Weve recently seen it in a leaked benchmark and it destroyed the competition winning by 42 when compared to its predecessor the RTX 3080M. This model is equipped with 7424 CUDA cores 12GB of memory and a maximum boost clock of 2. 28GHz. The mainstream Lastly we have the RTX 4060 and the RTX 4050 which are set to appear in more budgetfriendly laptop models. The specifications of the RTX 4060 include 3072 CUDA cores clock speeds of up to 2370MHz and 8GB of GDDR6 memory while the RTX 4050 comes with 2560 CUDA cores the same maximum clock speed and 6GB of GDDR6 VRAM. When it comes to the mainstream sector Nvidia zones in on the performance per watt promising to deliver the performance of the RTX 3080 at onethird of the power cost. The Instead of the staggered release approach that Nvidia took with its desktop lineup the RTX 40series Nvidia said that the flagship RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 will arrive first on February 8 with a price tag of at least 1999. The RTX 4070 RTX 4060 and RTX 4050 will begin showing up in In addition to mobile GPUs Nvidia revealed new desktop GPUs a new GeForce Now tier and more.

26,CES 2023: Nvidia GeForce Now is coming to internet-enabled cars,"You'll soon be able to stream and play Nvidia GeForce now games like Rocket League in select, internet-enabled cars.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/nvidia-geforce-now-cars-ces-2023/,Nvidia GeForce Now is coming to an unexpected new platform cars. The cloud streaming service will start rolling out in select internetenabled vehicles with three partners announced during Nvidias CES 2023 showcase. GeForce Now is a popular gaming subscription service that allows players to stream games from the cloud. Nvidia expanded the services functionality and reach over the past few years even bringing it to Samsung smart TVs as a native app. The services latest expansion will take the service to the open road. A video accompanying the announcement shows a driver loading up the GeForce Now app via a screen in a car clicking on Rocket League and playing it with a connected gamepad. Nvidia notes that no special equipment is required to get the service running in a vehicle. Three partners will add GeForce Now to their vehicles to start BYD Hyundai Motor Group and Polestar. All three companies are currently working on integrating the service with no other partners named. The move is part of Nvidias vision of the future which it predicts will see car interiors turning into mobile living spaces. The company is careful to note how it expects drivers to play in the car though noting that it sees games being played while an electric car charges or while waiting to pick up a family member. The video also shows kids playing Rocket League on backseat screens during a drive which is perhaps the more practical use case. Nvidia isnt the only company looking to bring games to cars. Tesla recently gave drivers the ability to play Steam games inside of their vehicles.

31,The first RTX 4070 Ti preorders confirm our worst fears,"We've just received our first reports of an Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti graphics card being found for sale. Unfortunately, it's not great news.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-found-for-sale/,Nvidias GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is rumored to be coming out soon and some retailers across the globe have jumped the gun and started putting it up for sale ahead of time. This time the GPU was spotted at a Chinese retailer in two custom versions. These early listings provide us with the first hints as to the pricing of the RTX 4070 Ti. Unfortunately they only serve to confirm what weve already feared the GPU might be just as expensive as the RTX 4090 and the RTX 4080. Leaked images of the RTX 4070 Ti appeared on Baidu a Chinese website and were later shared by Wccftech. The photos show us two custom versions of the card both made by MSI the MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Gaming X and the RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 3X. Each has a slightly different price tag but both of those price tags are not great. The Ventus 3X is priced at 7199 RMB which translates to around 1034 while the Gaming X costs 7599 RMB 1092. This puts these cards just slightly south of the recommended price for the RTX 4080 which is of course quite ridiculous. However its important to note that these prices are likely different from what Nvidia will set as the MSRP for the RTX 4070 Ti. For one were dealing with two custom versions of the card and MSI is known for making some of the more highend models. Theyll have slightly better specs than the Founders Edition but theyll also cost more. Another thing to consider is that there are added taxes so this might be the price on the Chinese market but it doesnt necessarily mean that the U. S. market will receive the same treatment. In all likelihood it will be cheaper in the United States than it seems to be in China. On the other hand seeing an almost 1100 list price in China suggests that it still wont exactly be cheap. The RTX 4090 and the RTX 4080 are both expensive and so far all signs point to Nvidia continuing that trend. A price in the ballpark of 800 to 900 seems quite likely. Rumors say that the RTX 4070 Ti will be equipped with the full AD104400 GPU featuring 7680 CUDA cores. Other specs include a clock speed of 2610MHz likely higher for custom versions 48MB of L2 cache and up to 12GB of GDDR6X memory across a 192bit bus. The memory is supposed to be running at 21Gbps meaning a bandwidth of 504GBs. The RTX 4070 Ti keeps the power requirements fairly mild. With a TBP of 285 watts its set to consume less power than both the RTX 3080 10GB and the RTX 3070 Ti albeit very slightly 35 watts for the 3080 and 5 watts for the 3070 Ti. Performancewise the RTX 4070 Ti is said to be trailing far behind the RTX 4080 which is why its important that its not too expensive. If its priced correctly it could still become one of the best graphics cards for more balanced builds. Nvidia might shed more light on the matter during CES 2023.

32,The Worst Hacks of 2022,"The year was marked by sinister new twists on cybersecurity classics, including phishing, breaches, and ransomware attacks.",https://www.wired.com/story/worst-hacks-2022/,With the pandemic evolving into an amorphous new phase and political polarization on the rise around the world 2022 was an uneasy and often perplexing year in digital security. And while hackers frequently leaned on old chestnuts like phishing and ransomware attacks they still found vicious new variations to subvert defenses. Heres WIREDs look back on the years worst breaches leaks ransomware attacks statesponsored hacking campaigns and digital takeovers. If the first years of the 2020s are any indication the digital security field in 2023 will be more bizarre and unpredictable than ever. Stay alert and stay safe out there. For years Russia has pummeled Ukraine with brutal digital attacks causing blackouts stealing and destroying data meddling in elections and releasing destructive malware to ravage the countrys networks. Since invading Ukraine in February though times have changed for some of Russias most prominent and most dangerous military hackers. Shrewd longterm campaigns and grimly ingenious hacks have largely given way to a stricter and more regimented clip of quick intrusions into Ukrainian institutions reconnaissance and widespread destruction on the networkand then repeated access over and over again whether through a new breach or by maintaining the old access. The Russian playbook on the physical battlefield and in cyberspace seems to be the same one of ferocious bombardment that projects might and causes as much pain as possible to the Ukrainian government and its citizens. Ukraine has not been digitally passive during the war though. The country formed a volunteer IT Army after the invasion and it along with other actors around the world have mounted DDoS attacks disruptive hacks and data breaches against Russian organizations and services. Over the summer a group of researchers dubbed 0ktapus also sometimes known as Scatter Swine went on a massive phishing bender compromising nearly 10000 accounts within more than 130 organizations. The majority of the victim institutions were USbased but there were dozens in other countries as well according to researchers. The attackers primarily texted targets with malicious links that led to fake authentication pages for the identity management platform Okta which can be used as a single signon tool for numerous digital accounts. The hackers goal was to steal Okta credentials and twofactor authentication codes so they could get access to a number of accounts and services at once. One company hit during the rampage was the communications firm Twilio. It suffered a breach at the beginning of August that affected 163 of its customer organizations. Twilio is a big company so that only amounted to 0. 06 percent of its clients but sensitive services like the secure messaging app Signal twofactor authentication app Authy and authentication firm Okta were all in that slice and became secondary victims of the breach. Since one of the services Twilio offers is a platform for automatically sending out SMS text messages one of the knockon effects of the incident was that attackers were able to compromise twofactor authentication codes and breach the user accounts of some Twilio customers. As if that wasnt enough Twilio added in an October report that it was also breached by 0ktapus in June and that the hackers stole customer contact information. The incident highlights the true power and menace of phishing when attackers choose their targets strategically to magnify the effects. Twilio wrote in August we are very disappointed and frustrated about this incident. In recent years countries around the world and the cybersecurity industry have increasingly focused on countering ransomware attacks. While there has been some progress on deterrence ransomware gangs were still on a rampage in 2022 and continued to target vulnerable and vital social institutions including health care providers and schools. The Russianspeaking group Vice Society for example has long specialized in targeting both categories and it focused its attacks on the education sector this year. The group had a particularly memorable showdown with the Los Angeles Unified School District at the beginning of September in which the school ultimately took a stand and refused to pay the attackers even as its digital networks went down. LAUSD was a highprofile target and Vice Society may have bitten off more than it could chew given that the system includes more than 1000 schools serving roughly 600000 students. Meanwhile in November the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency the FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services released a joint warning about the Russialinked ransomware group and malware maker known as HIVE. The agencies said the groups ransomware has been used to target over 1300 organizations around the world resulting in roughly 100 million in ransom payments from victims. From June 2021 through at least November 2022 threat actors have used Hive ransomware to target a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure sectors the agencies wrote including Government Facilities Communications Critical Manufacturing Information Technology and especially Healthcare and Public Health. The digital extortion gang Lapsus was on an intense hacking spree at the beginning of 2022 stealing source code and other sensitive information from companies like Nvidia Samsung Ubisoft and Microsoft and then leaking samples as part of apparent extortion attempts. Lapsus has a sinister talent for phishing and in March it compromised a contractor with access to the ubiquitous authentication service Okta. The attackers appeared to be based primarily in the United Kingdom and at the end of March British police arrested seven people in association with the group and charged two at the beginning of April. In September though the group flared back to life mercilessly breaching the rideshare platform Uber and seemingly the Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar as well. On September 23 police in the UK said they had arrested an unnamed 17yearold in Oxfordshire who seems to be one of the individuals previously arrested in March in connection with Lapsus. The beleaguered password manager giant LastPass which has repeatedly dealt with data breaches and security incidents over the years said at the end of December that a breach of its cloud storage in August led to a further incident in which hackers targeted a LastPass employee to compromise credentials and cloud storage keys. The attackers then used this access to steal some users encrypted password vaultsthe files that contain customers passwordsand other sensitive data. Additionally the company says that some source code and technical information were stolen from our development environment during the August incident. LastPass CEO Karim Toubba said in a blog post that in the later attacks hackers compromised a copy of a backup that contained customer password vaults. It is not clear when the backup was made. The data is stored in a proprietary binary format and contains both unencrypted data like website URLs and encrypted data like usernames and passwords. The company did not provide technical details about the proprietary format. Even if LastPasss vault encryption is strong hackers will attempt to bruteforce their way into the password troves by attempting to guess the master passwords that users set to protect their data. With a strong master password this may not be possible but weak master passwords could be at risk of being defeated. And since the vaults have already been stolen LastPass users cant stop these bruteforce attacks by changing their master password. Users should instead confirm that they have deployed twofactor authentication on as many of their accounts as they can so even if their passwords are compromised attackers still cant break in. And LastPass customers should consider changing the passwords on their most valuable and sensitive accounts.,2022-12-29T12:00:00Z

Do they have anything in common well presumably not This is where the realms of the design world make us believe in things unfathomable and outrightly defying logic. So how about a BMW Motorrad electric bike powered by NVIDIA guts Designer Aaryaman Mistry Just like youd have the freedom to upgrade your PC with a new GPU or other hardware the idea of swapping old motorbike parts with a new one sounds adventurous. Aaryman has created an NVIDIApowered architecture for electric motorcycles of the future that caught my attention. Of course the level of standardization for each of those parts will be a herculean task on its own and whether or not all automotive manufacturers will comply with the idea is still a looming query. If hypothetically everything goes to plan the scope for modularity personalization and upgradability will be immense. Users can reflect their personality with custom parts and even 3D print those parts or buy them. When these parts have served the purpose they can be swapped with newer components rather than changing the electric twowheeler. Just like on this BMW x NVIDIA bike with the option to swap battery console saddle microchip or body frame components. A good example is toggling the handlebar section for racing or city riding configuration. This will give motorbike enthusiasts the flexibility of having different twowheelers for a specific purpose without having to buy a new one. The swapping will be effortless and as easy as changing a toddlers diaper. The bikes core houses the advanced GPU and CPU which can adapt to the ides current configuration. There are highend cooling systems by NVIDIA that keep the electric battery at the optimum operating temperature for peak performance. Everything about this bike seems very balanced without any overpowering elements while maintaining a scifi persona of a highly agile set of wheels.

Out tomorrow January 5th at a starting price of 799 799 Nvidia say its faster than their previous flagship the RTX 3090 Ti and will max out 1440p monitors. In terms of specs youre looking at 12GB of GDDR6X memory a boost clock speed of 2. 61GHz 7680 CUDA cores as well as DLSS 3 support. Its power usage also sits at 285W but Nvidia recommend you pair it with a 700W PSU. Of course if youve been following the drama over Nvidias cancelled 12GB RTX 4080 graphics card those specs will all look intimately familiar and thats because they are. Theyre exactly the same as that cancelled RTX 4080 variant suggesting that Nvidia have indeed just rebadged the unlaunched GPU as the RTX 4070 Ti. To briefly recap said drama the 12GB RTX 4080 was originally meant to launch alongside its 16GB sibling the RTX 4080 proper on November 16th last year. But Nvidia ended up cancelling the card about a month before it was meant to release citing that its not named right and that having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing so in the bin it went. Or so we thought. Instead its seemingly now resurfaced as the RTX 4070 Ti which is more or less what hardware editor James expected theyd do at the end of last year. The main upshot of this slightly protracted renaming process is that the resulting RTX 4070 Ti is now quite a bit cheaper than what it was going to be originally with partner cards starting at 799 799. Dont get me wrong thats still a sizable chunk of change but it is at least a smidge better than the 12GB RTX 4080s proposed launch price of 949 899 which is a particularly good turn out for us folks in the UK I might add. Hardware ed James will no doubt be putting the RTX 4070 Ti through its paces very soon so youll be able to see whether its worth the money in the coming weeks. If you dont want to wait for benchmarks to drop though youll hopefully be able to start putting orders in for RTX 4070 Ti cards tomorrow January 5th.,2023-01-04T11:56:09Z

37,Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti review: not the GPU you’re looking for,"Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti is an interesting case study of how important branding and pricing are, but when it comes to raw numbers, it struggles to compete.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-review/,Better name and a better price but the RTX 4070 Ti still fails to impress. DLSS 3 Excellent thermal performance Solid value at 1440p and 1080p Poor performance at 4K Will likely sell above list price Nvidias RTX 4070 Ti was destined for controversy the moment Nvidia decided to unlaunch its 12GB RTX 4080. We dont have the RTX 4070 yet so an upgraded Ti version is an odd move so early in Nvidias RTX 40series generation and the spec sheet proves that the RTX 4070 Ti is just the 12GB RTX 4080 with a name adjustment. Nvidia is making a price adjustment to match knocking 100 off the announced list price of 900. However early preorders show that the card likely wont sell for that price and the performance isnt worthy of sitting alongside the best graphics cards. There are bright notes such as DLSS 3 and excellent thermal management but the RTX 4070 Ti suffers from high pricing and trailing raw performance. Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti specs The RTX 4070 Ti spec sheet confirms what most of the PC hardware world has suspected for a long time its a rebranded version of Nvidias illfated RTX 4080 12GB. The specs line up and the naming is incheck too. On top of that Nvidia cut the card down to a more fitting 800 list price. Youre getting 21 fewer CUDA cores compared to the RTX 4080 as well as 4GB less GDDR6X memory. Youre losing 21 of the Tensor and ray tracing cores of the RTX 4080 as well further illustrating that the RTX 4070 Ti should have never been in Nvidias xx80 class of graphics cards. Power also takes a dive to a manageable 285 watts which is a far cry from the TGP of the RTX 4090 at 450W. As Nvidias released Ada Lovelace GPUs have shown though the listed power draw is far from what youll typically see. These cards are efficient so they generally operate below maximum power even in highly demanding games. The 12GB of GDDR6X is squeezed through a 192bit bus vastly lowering the total memory bandwidth. The RTX 4070 Ti now has a more fitting name and a more fitting price. Its still 200 more expensive than the RTX 3070 Ti but thats far from the massive 500 upcharge of the RTX 4080. My only concern is the memory specification. It comes with 12GB of GDDR6X memory but thats squeezed through a 192bit bus vastly lowering the total memory bandwidth. Thats a problem the RTX 3060 from the previous generation experienced though with slower GDDR6 memory. In fact lastgens RTX 3070 Ti has around 40 more bandwidth than the RTX 4070 Ti. Memory bandwidth isnt everything and as youll see in my results below the RTX 4070 Ti still puts up a good fight. But higher resolutions stress memory bandwidth more and my results show the RTX 4070 Tis advantage at 1440p and 1080p start to diminish. Synthetic performance Before getting into real games I ran a couple of synthetic benchmarks to get a highlevel view of where the RTX 4070 Ti sits. Genongen youre looking at about a 44 improvement over the RTX 3070 Ti as well as a 13 lead over the RTX 3090. Thats mighty impressive considering the selling price of the RTX 3090 right now. If there are cards available at the list price of 800 on release day the RTX 4070 Ti destroys the value of lastgen options. The comparison with currentgen cards is different though. The RTX 4070 Ti is about 10 slower than the RX 7900 XT and 15 slower than the RX 7900 XTX. The RTX 4070 Ti is about 11 cheaper at list price but Nvidia isnt making a Founders Edition for this card. Board partner cards generally sell for above list price which puts the RTX 4070 Ti in a tough spot against AMDs current flagships. Ray tracing is where Nvidia shows a commanding lead but not with the RTX 4070 Ti. The RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 top the charts in 3DMarks Port Royal AMDs GPUs dont even come close. But the RTX 4070 Ti is only a mere 3 ahead of the RX 7900 XT and 5 behind the RX 7900 XTX. Synthetic benchmarks dont tell the full story though. In real games the RTX 4070 Ti is slightly lower than the synthetic results suggest overall. However certain titles really stress the memory bandwidth especially at 4K and make the RTX 4070 Ti seem much less impressive. 4K gaming Although Nvidia is billing the RTX 4070 Ti as a 1440p graphics card you expect some 4K gaming prowess when youre spending 800. The RTX 4070 Ti surpasses the fated 60 frames per second fps mark at 4K but its still quite a ways below the competition. Its a massive 20 slower than the RTX 4080 and compared to the RTX 4090 its 41 slower. Both those cards are far more expensive than the RTX 4070 Ti but Nvidias latest GPU fails to best even its direct competitors. Its 11 slower than the 900 RX 7900 XT and only a measly 4 faster than the RTX 3090. In some games like Horizon Zero Dawn the RTX 3090 is even a hair faster. The biggest competition comes from AMDs RX 6950 XT though. This lastgen GPU trades blows with the RTX 4070 Ti and its 50 to 100 cheaper at the time of writing. At 4K the RTX 4070 Ti is an inflection point for Nvidias Ada Lovelace generation. Were starting to reach performance levels of lastgen flagships with only minor differences in pricing. If 800 is your absolute limit the RTX 4070 Ti still wins out with better ray tracing and features like Deep Learning Super Sampling DLSS 3. In the opposite direction spending a bit more nets you much more performance putting the RTX 4070 Ti in a precarious spot at 4K. 1440p gaming Its no surprise that Nvidia is selling the RTX 4070 Ti as a 1440p graphics card because it looks a lot more impressive at that resolution. At 4K it trades blow with the RTX 3090 but at 1440p the RTX 4070 Ti is around 13 faster. Thats not a bad deal considering the RTX 3090 still sells for around 900 to 1000. The margins against AMDs latest GPUs tighten up too with the RTX 4070 Ti falling 8 short of the RX 7900 XT and 14 below the RX 7900 XTX. For generational improvements the RTX 4070 Ti is 40 faster than the RTX 3070 Ti but its also 33 more expensive. Performance should scale much higher than price but its not as bad as the RTX 4080 we recently saw. That card provided a 40 improvement over the previous generation with a 71 markup in price. On the other end though the RTX 4090 brought a 58 improvement for a minor 6 markup. The RTX 4070 Ti sits somewhere in between. Although the RTX 4070 Ti is more impressive at 1440p its not a showstopper. The RTX 3090 is still faster in games like Gears Tactics but the RTX 4070 Ti claims a small victory in Horizon Zero Dawn. On the other end the card dominates in Forza Horizon 5 matching the RTX 4080 and showing how out of sorts the pricing is with that card. My main reservation about the RTX 4080 is if well ever see any cards for 800. Nvidia isnt making a Founders Edition design and board partners tell me that overclocked models will go for around 100 more. The math changes a lot if the RTX 4070 Ti ends up selling for north of 900 where AMDs RX 7900 XT despite being a poor value on its own shows a commanding lead. 1080p gaming Jumping down to 1080p a clear gap between lastgen and currentgen offerings starts to emerge. CPU bottlenecks come into play with such powerful GPUs at a low resolution and the gaps between the most powerful GPUs shrink to no more than a dozen frames. Its not worth going into the individual results because frankly there are far better 1080p graphics cards on the market that are leagues cheaper than any in the chart above. Whats interesting here is how the RTX 4070 Ti performs compared to higher resolutions. Its 20 faster than the RTX 3090 8 slower than the RX 7900 XT and 11 behind the RX 7900 XTX. Those are very similar results as 1440p but far different than what I saw at 4K. Thats the narrow memory bus of the RTX 4070 Ti at play. As the resolution climbs the card starts showing its limitations. Its far more impressive at 1440p and 1080p but its hard to justify an 800 GPU for these resolutions when there are much cheaper options. Ray tracing and DLSS 3 Ray tracing is an area where Nvidia has claimed a dominating lead over AMD but the RTX 4070 Ti challenges that position. At 4K its barely faster than the RTX 3090 and RX 7900 XTX. Ray tracing performance was a major reason to go with Nvidia over AMD in the previous generation but the RTX 4070 Ti proves those margins are slipping. Once again though the RTX 4070 Tis limited memory bus is at play with a 4K resolution. Jumping down to 1440p the RTX 4070 Ti ends up 10 faster than the RX 7900 XTX and 19 faster than its closest currentgen competitor the RX 7900 XT. And at 1080p that gap widens even more with the RTX 4070 Ti starting to reach toward the RTX 4080 in ray tracing. The big question is how important ray tracing is for you. It can be a revolutionary piece of kit in games like Portal RTX but in a lot of titles ray tracing still represents a big performance loss for a minor visual gain. Nvidia still holds a lead in ray tracing but unlike the previous generation AMDs competing GPUs can hold their own. The major plus for the RTX 4070 Ti is support for DLSS 3. This upscaling tech includes a frame generation feature that can double and sometimes triple your frame rate in games. Its not perfect as you can see from the visual artifacts in Marvels SpiderMan Miles Morales above. However DLSS 3 is a huge benefit for high refresh rate gaming at 4K with ray tracing maxed out. Its only in a few games right now but Nvidia is rapidly rolling the feature out to new releases like Warhammer 40000 Darktide and Need for Speed Unbound. Temperatures and power Now that we have AMDs nextgen graphics cards as a basis for comparison Nvidias efficiency and temperature control in the Ada Lovelace generation becomes all the more impressive. Just like the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 the RTX 4070 Ti comes with a relatively highlisted TGP. Youll rarely hit its power limit though. Throughout my test suite the RTX 4070 Ti hovered around 200W to 230W occasionally dipping down to 150W at lower resolutions. The highest power I measured was 260W in Gears Tactics at 4K which is consistently the most powerhungry game in my test suite. The Asus Tuf Gaming models I reviewed stayed cool and quiet as well never going above 65 degrees Celsius. It often went lower between 55 and 60 degrees and that was with the Performance BIOS on Asus card. This particular card includes a dual BIOS so you can toggle it over to Quiet mode if you want. Based on my testing you dont need to. Performance is still king for a graphics card but the unsung advantage of the RTX 4070 Ti over a card like the RX 7900 XT is that it runs cooler quieter and more efficiently. For all of Nvidias Ada Lovelace GPUs I forget I have them installed because they just dont get very loud. The RTX 4070 Ti is no different. Not the GPU youre looking for Although there are positive points for the RTX 4070 Ti its still the rebranded RTX 4080 12GB without a major drop in price. 100 off is nothing to sneeze at but without a Founders Edition design and the expectation from board partners to sell a 900 GPU I dont see too many cards actually going for list price. The biggest competitor is oddly AMDs RX 7900 XT. That card isnt a great value but it looks a lot more enticing when stacked up against the RTX 4070 Ti. AMDs card is nearly 12 faster and although Nvidia still holds a slight edge in ray tracing its not the massive lead we saw in the previous generation. At 800 the RTX 4070 Ti is a solid if slightly overpriced GPU. It would be a smash success if you could find cards around 700. At 850 to 950 where I expect most cards to sell there are better options. The RTX 4070 Ti offers DLSS 3 at a more affordable price but you trade a decent amount of performance compared to the competition for that feature.

Some might think that only games and gamers actually benefit from advancements in this field but the proliferation of 2D and 3D digital art the push for the metaverse and even the booming industry of live streaming all depend on not only powerful but also accessible graphics. At the heart of all these is of course the graphics processing unit or GPU the dedicated piece of hardware that can make or break the graphics experience. Graphics cards especially those inside thin laptops are no longer just a luxury for gamers and NVIDIAs latest GeForce RTX 40 Series is demonstrating how these same technologies presumed to be just for gamers are also essential in supporting the sophisticated needs and workflows of todays creators. Designer NVIDIA Announced a few months ago NVIDIAs GeForce RTX 40 family is built on the companys new Ada Lovelace architecture that as you might expect pushes the envelope in terms of graphics performance while balancing thermal and power efficiency. The graphics giants CES 2023 address was naturally filled with the technical terms and buzzwords that both gamers and game developers drool over including the nextgen AIpowered ray tracing technology DLSS3. These very same features however support more than just the consumption of content but more importantly empower creators with new tools to bring their ideas and imagination to life. The GeForce RTX 40 graphics cards naturally make apps run more smoothly and fluidly particularly those that depend heavily on graphics performance such as Blender and Photoshop. NVIDIAs graphics cards also include a tiny supercomputer inside for machine learning and AI and this power also boosts the performance of AIbased tools like image generation realtime avatar control and other neat features like Eye Focus which remaps your eye so that it seems like youre always looking straight at the camera. NVIDIA also presents its Omniverse platform and a suite of new tools in its NVIDIA Studio that allow creators to collaborate on a single project from different parts of the world using different tools. Whether its creating 3D animation or 2D art NVIDIAs latest generation of graphics cards provides the power and intelligence to make it happen. Of course all that power would remain unused unless it landed in the hands of the creators it was made for. Taking aim at the growing trend of 14inch laptops NVIDIA is bringing the GeForce RTX 40 family to a wide variety of laptops from different brands some starting as low as 999. By bringing this technology in a more portable and accessible form NVIDIA is empowering creators designers gamers and live streamers to dream big and go big bringing their ideas to life and making this world a more vibrant and lively place.,2023-01-03T17:30:09Z
43,NVIDIA GeForce Now gaining RTX 4080 support and coming to cars,"During CES 2023, NVIDIA announced that the new Ultimate tier of its GeForce Now service will be powered by the RTX 4080 GPU, and the service is also heading to cars.",https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/nvidia-geforce-now-gaining-rtx-4080-support-and-coming-to-cars,NVIDIA GeForce Now gaining RTX 4080 support and coming to cars NVIDIAs GeForce Now cloud gaming service is getting more powerful and coming to more places. What you need to know NVIDIA GeForce Now is a cloud gaming service powered by NVIDIAs highend RTX GPUs. During CES 2023 NVIDIA announced that GeForce Nows Ultimate tier will be moving to the RTX 4080 platform. This means support for up to 240 FPS while streaming games with DLSS 3 and full RTX raytraced visuals. NVIDIA is also working with car manufacturers like Hyundai and Polestar to bring GeForce Now to cars. Cloud gaming is an excellent way to game wherever you are and NVIDIAs GeForce Now is one of the most impressive services currently available. Powered by NVIDIAs industryleading RTX GPUs GeForce Now lets users stream well over a thousand different games and its about to get a major performance upgrade and become available in new places. Announced by NVIDIA during CES 2023 GeForce Now is making the jump to the immensely capable NVIDIA RTX 4080 GPU allowing players subscribed to the services most premium Ultimate tier to take advantage of the latest NVIDIA technologies. With the 4080 in tow players will be able to stream games at the highest settings up to a staggering 240 FPS with DLSS 3 and fullfledged RTX raytracing on board. NVIDIA is promising improved visuals and reduced latency with the introduction of the RTX 4080. GeForce Now is also gaining framepacing technology when used in its 240 FPS mode allowing varied streaming rates to further reduce input latency. NVIDIA GeForce Now gained support for up to 120 FPS in Aug. 2022 and its already upping the ante significantly alongside its major power boost. The Ultimate tier which is 19. 99 a month or 99. 99 every six months is already powered by the stillimpressive RTX 3080. Current subscribers will be upgraded to the RTX 4080powered servers when they become available starting later this month in North America and Europe. In other news GeForce Now will also become available in more places as NVIDIA is partnering with several car manufacturers to bring the cloud gaming service to your vehicle. Hyundai which also owns the Kia and Genesis brands and Polestar will count among the first manufacturers to include NVIDIA GeForce Now in their vehicles allowing users to stream hundreds of their favorite PC games when away from home and presumably when at a stop. Windows Central take Making cloud gaming better and more accessible I recently wrote about how I finally believe in the dream of Xbox Cloud Gaming after reviewing one of the first cloud gamingfocused devices in the Logitech G Cloud which also supports NVIDIA GeForce Now. Im interested in seeing the space continue to evolve and NVIDIA certainly has one of the most interesting solutions. Rather than paying for a service that provides the games over the cloud NVIDIA lets you stream the games you already own on Steam the Epic Games Store GOG and more via its own servers. This is how GeForce Now supports over 1500 PC games including some of the most popular titles in the world and can stream those games at the very best settings as the NVIDIA RTX 4080 is significantly more powerful than any console including the Xbox Series X. Its great to see NVIDIA invest more into GeForce Now and for the service to already begin supporting the companys latest generation of gaming technologies. Im a little more dubious about the usefulness of cloud gaming in vehicles but NVIDIA isnt the first to attempt this. Teslas recently gained the ability to play Steam games and Windows Centrals Sean Endicott believes that the feature isnt as stupid as it may seem at first glance. Either way Ill be interested to see if GeForce Now in vehicles is what the service needs to really hit the mainstream.

44,NVIDIA upgrading GeForce Now in 2023 — RTX 4080 GPUs bring 4K gaming and more,NVIDIA is upgrading its cloud-gaming GeForce Now service with RTX 4080 GPUs for faster response times and higher-quality visuals.,https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/nvidia-upgrading-geforce-now-2023-rtx-4080-and-more,NVIDIA upgrading GeForce Now in 2023 RTX 4080 GPUs bring 4K gaming and more GeForce Now boasts 120Hz ultrawide gaming and a new membership tier. What you need to know NVIDIA is upgrading its cloudgaming GeForce Now service with RTX 4080 GPUs for faster response times and higherquality visuals. New SuperPOD servers are powered by the Ada Lovelace architecture supporting all visual enhancements provided by NVIDIA RTX. A new Ultimate membership tier will include the latest upgrades including up to 4K resolutions at 120 FPS with NVIDIA Reflex support for low latency input response. NVIDIA made waves at CES 2023 in Las Vegas by announcing a series of incoming upgrades to its cloudgaming GeForce now service. Current RTX 3080 membership subscribers will see their account upgraded to a new tier and newcomers will have opportunities to access the service for free with bundle deals from NVIDIA partners. Product manager Andrew Fear gave us a briefing to describe their plans for GeForce now over the year ahead including new features and support for upcoming devices. Acrosstheboard improvements to its service promise exciting times ahead for cloud gaming. Region expansion As of January 2023 NVIDIA reports that over 25 million users have tried the GeForce Now service. Moving into the year ahead its cloud platform is available in over 100 countries with more planned for expansion until all hemispheres are covered so that the sun never sets on GeForce Now. GeForce Now is supported by 30 data centers arranged across the globe by NVIDIA and its partners with three new operations including coverage for Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan by GFN. AM Malaysia by YTL and South Africa by Rain. Plans for upcoming regions havent been confirmed but NVIDIA seems determined in its aim for expansion. RTX 4080 in the SuperPOD One of the most significant announcements from NVIDIA at CES 2023 regarding GeForce Now was unveiling its SuperPOD cloud gaming supercomputers powered by the RTX 4080 GPU and the Ada Lovelace architecture within. These hefty servers are exclusively designed for gaming providing over 64 TFLOPs of processing power in the cloud 1. 7x faster than the current service using RTX 3080 GPUs. Supporting the RTX 4080 for GeForce Now brings more RTX goodies including complete ray tracing and DLSS 3 support for improved visuals with AV1 encoding saving around 15 bandwidth compared to H. 265. The flexible encoder is part of NVIDIAs aim to bring cloud gaming as close to desktop gaming as possible with sidebyside demonstrations at CES exhibiting how that is becoming a reality. RTX 4080 SuperPOD servers also support NVIDIA Reflex 240Hz in competitive mode reducing input latency to around 35ms when using a typical 120Hz TV in testing. Currentgeneration RTX 3080 systems for GeForce Now perform at about 60ms close to the average Xbox Series X output latency at 120Hz so anything less is a win for cloud gaming. Increasing to 240 FPS for rendering with NVIDIA Reflex frame pacing tech helps the cloudbased GPU process inputs from the user and respond with lowlatency visuals as fast as possible. Any titles with Reflex support should be more responsive on GeForce Now with the incoming upgrades depending on your membership level. New devices and features Working alongside manufacturers developing hardware specifically designed for cloud gaming NVIDIA is expanding its range of GeForce Now games with support for touch screens. Describing companies including Razer and Logitech as those who believe in the cloud NVIDIA demonstrated its new category additions to the cloud gaming library when launched on touchscreen devices. Titles with native touchscreen support including Genshin Impact will appear in a dedicated section alongside others designed for a natural experience whether or not you use a joypad attachment on mobile or tablets. Games with recent RTX enhancements will see similar publicity on GeForce Now including Fortnite for highend visuals over the cloud. Cloud gaming hardware is set to make waves this year with our Logitech G Cloud review proving that some of the only drawbacks are region restrictions which NVIDIA is actively working against. Upcoming Chromebook laptops from Acer ASUS and Lenovo will officially support GeForce Now. They offer a versatile and affordable method of accessing the platform alongside their cloudbased operating system. NVIDIAs product manager Andrew Fear confirmed that while a native GeForce Now application isnt available for Steam Deck they are looking to do more with it in 2023. Ultimate membership The new GeForce Now Ultimate membership tier was another huge announcement for NVIDIA at CES 2023 upgrading any existing RTX 3080 members. Starting in Q1 2023 these users will automatically be moved to the new RTX 4080 SuperPOD servers powered by Ada Lovelace but the subscription price is not planned to change. Alongside the improvements to this highend service including 4K resolution at 120 FPS and NVIDIA Reflex 240Hz Competitive mode support is support for ultrawide screens streaming up to 3840x1600 resolutions at 120Hz with HDR. Owners of compatible LG or Samsung TVs with GeForce Now will benefit from the same 4K resolution boost throughout Q1 of 2023. Promotions and partnerships Opportunities for free access to GeForce Now include bundles from ATT as new fiber broadband or 5G customer mobile customers will receive a 6month Ultimate membership worth 120. Google offers a similar deal with select cloud gamingfocused Chromebooks bundled with three months of Ultimate membership. Partnerships with NVIDIA and three automotive groups were also announced at this years CES convention including BYD Hyundai and Polestar. Ideal for electric cars for cloud gaming as owners charge their batteries with saves backed up to the NVIDIA servers ready to continue playing on any device at home. Exact timings and plans havent been confirmed for specific model implementation or availability but more information will be released throughout the year. GeForce Now is set to enjoy a significant upgrade with its brandnew SuperPOD servers powered by the RTX 4080 GPU and all its benefits including some of the lowest latency gaming in the cloud. Boosts to framerates and resolutions with support for ultrawide monitors and even more mobile devices means its appeal should broaden throughout 2023 especially with bundled memberships from ATT and Googles gaming Chromebooks. The updated servers are set to roll out throughout January by region with access depending on your location. If youre already a GeForce Now member you can expect to hear from NVIDIA confirming the migration soon.

47,ASUS updates its ROG Zephyrus gaming laptops with NVIDIA RTX 40 series graphics,"ASUS has also updated its ROG Zephyrus family of gaming laptops at CES with Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA-supplied upgrades and the Zephyrus Duo is still unmatched.",https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/asus-updates-its-rog-zephyrus-gaming-laptops-with-nvidia-rtx-40-series-graphics,ASUS updates its ROG Zephyrus gaming laptops with NVIDIA RTX 40 series graphics The Zephyrus Duo is still totally bananas. What you need to know ASUS has updated its Zephyrus gaming laptop at CES 2023 with minor changes on the outside and the latest and greatest on the inside. Latest generation CPUs from AMD and Intel are offered across the range. All use NVIDIAs latest RTX 40 series graphics for laptops. If theres one thing that CES is never short of that would be new gaming laptops and ASUS has taken enough to fill the show all by itself. Joining the 2023 Strix lineup is a refreshed range of Zephyrus laptops that follow much the same trend. The ROG Zephyrus laptops share much of the same DNA as the Strix family but are more focused on being slimmer lighter and altogether more portable. None of that is changing and from the outside it doesnt look like much has at all. All the good stuff is going on under the hood. That means new CPUs from Intel and AMD are on offer and of course NVIDIAs latest RTX 40 series laptop graphics. The Zephyrus Duo is also sticking around and gets itself a suitably ludicrous 2023 performance upgrade too. ROG Zephyrus Duo is still absurdly impressive The dualscreened Zephyrus Duo has always been the star of the lineup and its getting itself a nice little upgrade package for 2023. The basic package remains the same but the internals have been given a kick in the pants with about the most power you could squeeze in. The CPU has been upgraded to a 16core AMD Ryzen 9 Zen 4 unit while the graphics are taken care of in the form of the NVIDIA RTX 4090. The max TGP is limited to 125W but given how sleek this laptop is and the fact you have two displays its nothing to be sniffed at. It also still commands a serious price nudging 4000. But theres still nothing else like it. Hardware upgrades across the range The rest of the Zephyrus range also sees significant upgrades. The M16 has been completely redesigned and will come with up to a 13th Gen Intel Core i9 24core CPU and NVIDIA RTX 4090 graphics. Packing ASUS latest TriFan cooling system and fullwidth heatsink the TGP on the latest model is 20W higher than its predecessor. The chassis has also had an upgrade with a better finish on its exterior and a muchimproved version of ASUS matrix display on the lid. As with the Strix family the Zephyrus laptops will be getting the latest Nebula displays with 3ms or less response time and 100 DCIP3 color gamut. The M16 additionally gets the Nebula HDR panel with 1100 nits brightness and QHD resolution at 240 Hz.

48,CES 2023 preview: What to expect at the Las Vegas tech extravaganza,"Next week at the CES 2023 tech trade show in Las Vegas, we'll once again be able to see the latest tech trends in person. Here's our preview.",https://venturebeat.com/ai/ces-2023-preview-what-to-expect-at-the-las-vegas-tech-extravaganza/,Next week at the CES 2023 trade show in Las Vegas well once again be able to see and hear about the latest tech trends in person. Last years event also took place in person but it was a shadow of its former self as the Omicron wave of COVID19 took its toll. The event only drew about 45000 last year far below the 175212 that showed up in January 2019. This year theyre expecting around 100000 people to show up according to Gary Shapiro CEO of Consumer Technology Association the trade group that stages the event. Last years event looked like a ghost town. At least it seemed that way in pictures as I canceled my trip about a week before the show after everybody else canceled their appointments with me. The same kind of cancellation tsunami hasnt happened this year. This year the show gets underway on Tuesday morning with some virtual sideline events from Nvidia and Acer. I think its safe to say well see plenty of new chips and PC gaming rigs announced. The difference this year is that because of the recession we can probably expect to buy more of these products sooner than we were able to do so during the shortages of the past couple of years. Event Intelligent Security Summit OnDemand Learn the critical role of AI ML in cybersecurity and industry specific case studies. Watch ondemand sessions today. A few thousand press people will start converging on Las Vegas on Tuesday and Wednesday for media events that officially begin with a talk on tech trends by Steve Koenig vice president of research at the CTA followed by the opening CES Unveiled press event. If its your first time to the show check out my tips and tricks for CES. On Wednesday big companies like LG Panasonic Samsung TCL and Sony will have their press conferences where they show off the new products coming this year. By Thursday the main show floors will open with nearly 3000 exhibitors across more than 2. 1 million square feet of space Shapiro said. Thats down from 4500 exhibitors and 2. 9 million square feet in January 2020. But its still a sizable show and it runs through Sunday. And while CES is still a place for the giants like Samsung and Sony the show will have 1000 new exhibitors and it will also have its traditional Eureka Park startup space in the Venetian. The big trends Last week PR Newswire reported that there was a 340 increase in mentions in CES 2023 press releases with more than 66 mentions in 2022 compared to 2021. NFT mentions were up 200 to 12 up from four. Sustainability mentions were up 63 to 49 up from 30. Robots were mentioned 49 times up only 2 from 48 a year ago. The losers Augmented reality slipped 12 to 30 from 34 and wearable dropped 38 from 88 to 55. In our interview Shapiro said well see an incredibly strong health tech category. Shapiro expects well see a lot of food tech like from a company called Suvie which cooks food while youre away and is ready when you get home. Based on the pitches Im getting I think well see a lot of tech related to AI health wearables energysaving devices the internet of things IoT sleep care elder care mental care smart cars robots and virtual reality think Sony and HTC at the very least. AI AI is kind of an invisible product but its presence will be visible everywhere at the show. Generative AI startups might be arriving on the scene too late to make a big presence at the show but everyone from big companies to startups will be talking about how AI is fueling a new generation of products. Embodied maker of the social interaction robot Moxie uses interactions enabled by generative AI to help promote social emotional and cognitive development in children ages five to 10. It is now shipping the robot that it has been showing for a couple of years. Square Off a maker of smart chessboards with an adaptive AI will be back to show off what it can with its partnership with Miko a consumer robotics company that makes AI robots for kids. There are a lot of people concerned about the encroachment of AI into our lives. Alice Little an awardwinning legal courtesan currently operating out of the Chicken Ranch brothel near Las Vegas said in a statement that AI tech will threaten the livelihood of sex workers who have come to depend on digital experiences such as Only Fans during the pandemic. She believes these kinds of creator platforms could be significantly hurt by AI particularly deepfake technology that creates fake images of real people. Well see this debate play out in industry after industry. Smart green vehicles on the rise AI is also going to get used in the latest vehicles. More than a dozen automakers will be at the show and theyll be showing off electric vehicles assisted driving features and more. John Deere which has one of the keynote slots for its CEO John May will show off AIbased tractors that can operate around the clock. Candela is manufacturing a new electric flying C8 consumer boat. It is an electric vehicle that rides above the waves and is a sibling to Candelas P12 electric hydrofoil ferry. Cenntro Electric Group is will unveil five new electric vehicles at CES including a hydrogenpowered semi and the production version of its iChassis. And as you can see below well have our share of flying cars again. Aska will be showing off its first driveandfly electric vertical takeoff and landing eVTOL aircraftcar hybrid. It is an electric vehicle that you can drive on the road like a car and fly in the air like a quadrocopter. Is it real Lets hope so. The metaverse Wherever AI gets mentioned the metaverse cant be far behind. And where the metaverse gets mentioned Web3 will come up as well. Its still early and a bit rare to see actual metaverse experiences on display at the show. Source Digital and Sansar announced they will show off a metaverse experience on smart TVs where you can engage in VRlike 2D or 3D experiences from the makers of Sansar which spun out of Second Lifes Linden Lab and was sold in 2020 to Wookey Projects. While we may not see a ton of actual metaverse projects at the show we will hear people talking about it especially in the visions presented in keynote speeches and panels. In fact Im going to moderate a panel at CES on Friday January 6 about how gaming will lead the metaverse. It will take place at 3 pm on Friday January 6 at LVCC North N262 and feature speakers from Area15 Upland Holoride and Tilt Five. With all this talk about the metaverse Shapiro isnt so worried that demand for an inperson CES will fall off. Were very optimistic that CES is so important to people around the world as buyers investors suppliers partners media consultants market analysts that we expect a strong showing in Las Vegas Shapiro said. But the digital platform will be an important supplement to many of the people going to Las Vegas who are just too busy to get to the conferences or connect with the exhibitors that they want to. Thats what the platform will be for to serve those people. As for blockchain OpenCarbon is touting its first nonfungible token NFT marketplace for carbon credits. The OpenCarbon platform delivers SECcompliant carbon offset financial products to efficiently source construct manage and retire largescale and complex carbon asset portfolios. The internet of things LG is partnering with Asleep to create smart home appliances that respond to human breathing and diagnose sleep stages to operate at an optimal level. So your air conditioning and heating and other home appliances can respond to how youre sleeping at night. Well see plenty of other examples of the internet of things creeping deeper into our lives. Lets hope the theme of Ubisofts Watchdogs game that these devices will be used by hackers and governments to spy on us wont come true. You can bet that the internet of things will further infiltrate its way into smart homes smart buildings and smart whatevers. Artificial intelligence buoyed by successes in computer vision neural networks and machine learning will be pervasive within these IoT devices. VR and gaming gear Sony will take the stage at CES to share details about its PlayStation VR2 headset and the games coming for the device which debuts on February 22. HTC is expected to make an announcement and a number of other VR headset makers are showing up at CES. And VRs platform is always changing. bHapticss new TactGlove can be worn like regular gloves. Its compatible with commercial VRAR headsets with camerabased hand tracking systems including Meta Quest 2 and costs 300 per pair. The new haptic gloves have 12 Linear Resonant Actuatortype motors LRA which the company says allows delicate and sophisticated feedback at the fingertips and wrists. Holoride will be at the show again display how you can play virtual reality games in the back seat of a car without losing your lunch. On the gaming side well see LGs 27inch OLED gaming monitor and Alienwares latest 18inch gaming laptop. Nvidia will likely talk about the GeForce RTX 40series graphics chips and AMD will attempt to outdo Nvidia with its own GPUs. MSI will show a flagship gaming laptop Titan GT77 that will feature a 4K144Hz Mini LED display. You can bet there will be a ton more on display at the show. Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su will kick off the show at 630 p. m. on Wednesday with a keynote speech. So were likely to hear about the latest Ryzen and Radeon chips. As for TVs some aficionados are hoping to hear more about QDOLED as the future of cuttingedge TV tech so itll be interesting to see if anyone has anything to add on that front. Health tech Valencell unveiling the first calibrationfree cuffless fingertip blood pressure monitor. Companies like Omron Healthcare have been whittling away at this kind of problem for years. Dexcom has received clearance from the FDA for its glucose monitor Dexcom 7 which makes it much easier to measure blood sugar levels for people with diabetes. Withings a pioneer of connected health will unveil its first foray into urine analysis with a miniaturized health lab that will change the way people monitor their health from the comfort and privacy of their own bathroom. If this works you may not have to pee in a cup at the doctors office or a lab so much. While we urinate on average seven times a day urine analyses are usually performed only once a year when requested by your health professional. Now Withings is making it possible to conduct health assessments from the comfort and privacy of your bathroom on a regular basis. And Im expecting to see more solutions than ever that target elderly people and their caregivers as tech has finally woken up to the demographic trend of the baby boomers get older. Tech isnt going to be just for the young anymore. Japans Asilla is showing off a security camera that sends you alerts to unusual things happening in real time like if someone falls on the ground. We can expect to see more of these products as Synaptics has created falldetection sensors that use AI to detect if people have fallen and need help. Food tech OneThird a Dutch food tech company will show a ripeness checker designed for use by grocers or grocery store shoppers. It lets them quickly scan an avocado and get accurate information about when it is ready for consumption no squeezing necessary. Apparently were not so good at the squeezing part as onethird of all food produced is wasted due to spoilage costing upwards of 1 trillion. OneThirds solution helps endconsumers get the freshest food and allows growers food distributors and grocers to predict the shelf life of fresh produce. Typhur will show off its allinone smart Sous Vide cooking machine with cooking classes and recipes from chefs all around the world including Michelin Star Chefs. Retro trends If youre not into all this new stuff you can see old stuff too. RCA will be among the retro brands coming to the show and it will show off home automation ebikes scooters and retrostyle electronics. For some of us that brings back some memories. Weird uses for new technology Ive been pitched some oddball things that I didnt expect see. For instance Glxkind is showing off an AIpowered baby stroller with a motor. It comes with an sleep solution with rockmybaby white noise and 360 safety bubble around the stroller. I suppose I shouldnt call this weird because it could be very useful for its target consumers. But its certainly something I didnt expect see. Meanwhile Osim is going to show off its uLove 3 WellBeing Chair which uses AI to help give you massages. The chair is designed to measure monitor and manage stress while giving you a fullbody massage. After picking up a video from your own library or by using a YouTube link you can add scents on the timeline to set up the perfect smell timing and duration for a scent to go with your video. Whats missing from CES Some common CES events wont happen. Nvidia will be doing an online press event but it wont be on the show floor. Apple doesnt exhibit at the show as it always does its own events. I expect we wont see as many masks either. But I suggest everybody be extra safe with so many people concentrated in Vegas. With as many as 71000 fewer people Im certainly hoping for fewer lines and crowds around the popular booths. But like many people Im curious what it will be like seeing people facetoface again at a huge trade show. Hopefully it will feel like were all getting back to business. Tech for the rest of us I have some hope that there will be some interesting technologies from nontech companies. Halio is showing off smart glass. You can put this on windows and building facades to prevent solar heat from cooking everybody inside a building. This reduces a facilitys carbon footprint by limiting energy used for air conditioning or heating. I like how its another example of how tech fades into the woodwork of everyday things. My favorite CES talk about tech from nontech companies was a few years ago when Arnold Donald the CEO of the worlds largest cruise company Carnival Cruises unveiled the Ocean Medallion wearable. That was interesting because it was an example of how technology was infiltrating a nontech business where the technology faded into the woodwork and the woodwork itself got smart. Carnival is now outfitting its 100plus cruise ships with the technology. In recent years Procter Gamble has also showed up with cool uses of tech in ordinary products such as putting sensors and AI into products such as skin advisers heated razors and more. It will be back this year with more products that promise the same kind of creativity as last years products which included a blemish remover that worked well on my face. I could still use more of that and I think we could all use tech that makes the current products that we use every day even better.

50,Graphics card prices are ridiculous — that's (one reason) why I'm backing Intel,"Graphics cards are ridiculously expensive nowadays and the market leader, NVIDIA, is very happy with that. But I'm not, and I'm backing Intel to help solve it.",https://www.windowscentral.com/graphics-cards-are-too-expensive-backing-intel,Graphics card prices are ridiculous thats one reason why Im backing Intel The 800 NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti is not the answer to the problem. I am really truly tired of graphics card prices. Dont get me wrong I love the NVIDIA RTX 4090 as a thing a feat of engineering. The performance it delivers is truly breathtaking even if its size is equal to its power. But its also insanely expensive. Even more so in the UK where I am. The same applies to the RTX 4080 and even AMDs newest range of highend Radeon cards. Albeit theyre at least more affordable than NVIDIAs. And the new 800 RTX 4070 Ti isnt close to being a solution. There are now three companies making consumer GPUs and its the newcomer Intel thats getting the most backing from me. The Intel Arc A770 is my favorite of all recently released graphics cards and I really really hope that Intel sticks it out and helps to change the game for us all. NVIDIA is the market leader and can do what it likes You know how the iPhone is crazy expensive and Apple has no interest in trying to make it more affordable Its popularity alone means theres little need to consider it. I feel like a similar situation is in play with NVIDIA graphics cards too. AMD has plenty of diehard fans but NVIDIA is the clear market leader. So wheres the motivation to try and make these things cheaper NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has already proudly declared Moores Law to be dead as part of the justification for high GPU prices. Not everyone shares the same opinion but NVIDIA has done everything it can to tell us that these things are expensive theyre always going to be expensive from now on and that its perfectly OK. Except its not. Not for those of us out there who dont live in a bubble and have bills to worry about. Theres also the small fact that NVIDIA like AMD starts at the highest end most expensive models first. As of now theres no RTX 4050 or 4060 series for desktop users. The RTX 4070 Ti is the lowest end new card available and its 800 at least. So buyers on tighter budgets either have to get something older or used. The same with AMDs latest highend Radeon cards. Or they could buy from Intel. Intel seems committed to trying to be affordable When the Intel Arc desktop graphics cards first launched the company was very clear in its press briefings that it believes in trying to keep prices as reasonable as possible. The Arc A770 16GB is the most expensive of the current batch with a recommended price of around 350. Sure it cant touch the RTX 4090 4080 or even the 4070 Ti. Not in gaming performance at least. But its not trying to be highend and I can tell you from plenty of experience using one its a very good graphics card. I play at 1440p and the A770 is capable of delivering high frame rates and graphical fidelity at this resolution. Hell it can even just about handle ray tracing at times. Its also every bit as modern as the 40 series. Besides ray tracing one of the standout features is the hardware AV1 encoder. All Intel Arc desktop GPUs have this right down to the circa 150 A380. AV1 encoding is going to become more important for content creators in the future and Intel has an affordable way to add one to your system without spending a heap of your hardearned cash. There are drawbacks such as no hardware support for DX9 so older games are hitandmiss as to how well they work if at all. Intel has since said it plans to work on this but it relies on Microsoft translating it into a more modern API. For example I can play the older Borderlands titles just fine but Batman Arkham Asylum will crash at the same point at the beginning of the game every single time. But for modern games things are generally fine. Intels commitment to value though alongside how good the firstgeneration Arc graphics cards actually are when you spend enough time with them is why Im fully behind the blue team. I like an underdog anyway but I have a real appreciation for what Intel is trying to do. Long may it continue. Saving money with Intel and cloud I also want to bring up cloud gaming because its becoming more and more attractive even from NVIDIA itself. Were not in a position yet where it can replace local gaming but its getting better all the time even if Google decided to get out of it. Naturally in areas without great internet its a nonstarter and the library available is nothing like what youll find on Steam for example. But with Microsoft and NVIDIA in particular putting a ton of effort into making it work for a lot of folks its another reason not to spend a fortune on an expensive graphics card. NVIDIAs own GeForce Now service has just announced a new tier based on the RTX 4080 at the same event as the RTX 4070 Ti launch. You can subscribe to this for a number of years for the same price as an RTX 4070 Ti and if you have the connection and hardware for it youll get better performance from the games. All of this adds up and Im definitely in the camp of spending less money on graphics cards without really having to sacrifice a great deal. Im enjoying my gaming and with the combination of Intel Arc and the cloud I dont feel like Im missing out on anything. No matter how much I love the RTX 4090.

51,"CES 2023 roundup: NVIDIA 4070 Ti, AMD Ryzen 7000, 13th Gen Intel, and PCs from Lenovo, Razer, HP, ASUS, and more","During CES 2023, we saw major announcements from AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA. Just about every major laptop and PC manufacturer also unveiled new hardware. Here are the highlights.",https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/ces-2023-roundup-nvidia-4070-ti-amd-ryzen-7000-13th-gen-intel-and-pcs-from-lenovo-razer-hp-asus-and-more,CES 2023 roundup NVIDIA 4070 Ti AMD Ryzen 7000 13th Gen Intel and PCs from Lenovo Razer HP ASUS and more CES saw a massive range of devices from the biggest names in tech. CES 2023 has officially wrapped up leaving us with a litany of devices to study and look forward to throughout the year. Just about all of the major tech brands made at least one announcement during or centered around the conference. AMD Intel and NVIDIA made CPU and GPU news while Dell LG Lenovo and Razer were among the many OEMs to unveil laptops PCs and accessories. With so many announcements to sort through its easy to miss a few or even tune out the news since it comes so quickly. Heres a recap of the biggest announcements at CES 2023 at least on the Windows side of things. Our colleagues over at Android Central covered CES too. NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti What was arguably the biggest news of last week wasnt necessarily good news. NVIDIA confirmed pricing for its RTX 4070 Ti graphics card. That GPU was once known as the RTX 4080 before NVIDIA pulled its launch and rebranded it under the 4070 Ti moniker. The RTX 4070 Ti was officially announced at CES 2023 in a move that was a bit of a surprise. The graphics card is designed for 1440p gaming. Its pricing starts at 800 which is 100 less than what it was going to priced at when it was the RTX 4080. That fact irked many who point to the price drop as proof that the card was overpriced under its previous branding. While the pricing proved controversial the RTX 4070 Ti will likely be among the best graphics cards when it comes to performance. The card should handle the best PC games at 1440p and be able to power some 4K gaming especially if you take advantage of Deep Learning Super Sampling DLSS 3 which is exclusive to NVIDIAs RTX 40 series. AMD Ryzen 7000 laptop CPUs AMD also hit the showroom floor at CES. The company unveiled its Ryzen 7000 series laptop CPUs for the next wave of PCs. Many of the laptops announced at the conference had variants powered by AMDs latest chips. Since the Ryzen 7000 range has a mixture of architectures and naming schemes it can be a bit confusing. Our managing editor Richard Devine broke down all of the new chips last week. Heres a quick rundown Ryzen 7020 series Based on Zen 2 with a maximum of 4cores and 8threads. Integrated graphics based on RDNA 2. Supports LPDDR5 memory. Ryzen 7030 series Based on Zen 3 with a maximum of 8cores and 16threads. Integrated graphics based on Vega and supports DDR4 and LPDDR4 memory. Ryzen 7035 series Based on Zen 3 with a maximum of 8cores and 16threads. Integrated graphics based on RDNA 2 and supports DDR5 and LPDDR5 memory. Ryzen 7040 series Based on Zen 4 with a maximum of 8cores and 16threads. Integrated graphics based on RDNA 3 and supports DDR5 and LPDDR5 memory. AMD also announced Ryzen AI last week. Its an XDNA Adaptive AI architecture that will feature in the Ryzen 7040 series of processors. This is the first time that an AI engine has been integrated into an x86 CPU and it promises better efficiency in the area. Intel 13th Gen chips Intel had a massive CES. The chipmaker unveiled the 13th Gen Intel Core mobile CPUs that power many of the newly announced laptops from CES 2023. The company also expanded its 13th Gen desktop CPU lineup and announced the new entrylevel Core i3 Nseries mobile CPUs. The family of 13th Gen Intel Core mobile processors includes the worlds first 24core processor for a laptop. In total Intel announced 32 chips across its latest generation of mobile CPUs. The flagship Intel Core i913980HX holds the top spot of the family thanks to its 24 cores. Our channel editor Ben Wilson shared the complete specs of all of the mobile CPUs last week. Intel first announced its 13th Gen desktop CPUs back in September 2022 but those were Kseries processors. Last week the chipmaker took the wraps off its 65watt and 35watt 13th Gen desktop CPUs. The chips have up to 8 more efficiency cores than the previous generation maxing out at a total of 24 8 performance and 16 efficiency. I broke down the full specs of the chips during CES. On the lower end of the processor spectrum Intel announced its entrylevel Core i3 Nseries mobile CPUs. The Nseries chips have up to 8 efficiency cores and are built on Intel 7 process tech. Those processors are designed for efficiency and are aimed at the education sector. Lenovos unique PCs Lenovo announced a large library of devices at CES 2023 including Legion gaming PCs a ThinkBook Twist with an eink display and an OLED screen and a powerful AllinOne. But one device stood out the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. That laptop features a pair of OLED displays and looks like the spiritual successor to the neverreleased Surface Neo. The Yoga Book 9i can flip around into different postures similar to Lenovos other Yoga Books. Unlike its flexible siblings the Yoga Book 9i can also be used with its dual displays stacked vertically or horizontally allowing the PC to act as a portable desktop. An included Bluetooth keyboard can attach to the Yoga Book 9i magnetically which lets a person use the computer as a traditional clamshell laptop. The Yoga Book 9i looks like a mix of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold and the Microsoft Surface Neo both of which have garnered attention from our readers over the years. The foldable PC is expected to ship in June 2023 with a starting price of 2100. Razer Blade 18 16 and more Razer announced its new lineup of Razer Blade laptops powered by 13th Gen Intel Core processors. The Razer Blade 16 features a dualmode LED QHD display with a refresh rate of 240Hz and a brightness of 1000 nits. The company also unveiled the Razer Blade 18 and a range of accessories including a webcam a PC soundbar and a gaming chair cushion with speakers and haptic feedback. The Razer Blade 18 and Blade 16 run on 13th Gen mobile processors from Intel alongside NVIDIA RTX 4000 series graphics. They also support DDR5 memory and max out several other aspects of their respective spec sheets. Based on their specs and designs both of Razers new offerings should rank among the best gaming laptops. There are quite a few models of the Razer Blade 18 and Blade 16 all of which were broken down by our gaming editor Rebecca Spear. Quite a few gaming accessories and peripherals were shown off by Razer last week. Project Carol is a gaming chair head cushion that includes haptic feedback powered by Razer HyperSense and 7. 1 surround sound audio. The Razer Edge is the latest gaming handheld. It has a 6. 8inch AMOLED display and runs on the Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 processor. With that hardware the Razer Edge can play native Android games while also supporting streaming through Xbox Cloud Gaming. Rounding out the wave of announcements was the Razer Kiyo Pro Ultra Webcam the Razer Leviathan V2 Pro soundbar and an adjustable head strap for the Meta Quest 2. HPs powerful PCs HP showed off some powerful new PCs at CES 2023. Laptops and desktops from the OMEN lineup were unveiled as well as the HP Dragonfly Pro and Dragonfly G4 laptops. The PCs run on the respective 13th Gen Intel CPUs for their form factor. The OMEN 40L and 45L top the charts with support for 13th Gen Intel Core i913900K and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090. On the laptop side of things the OMEN 17 features a 13th Gen Intel Core i913900HX mobile processor. The Dragonfly laptops are aimed at creators and freelancers. The Dragonfly Pro has an AMD Ryzen 7736U inside while the Dragonfly G4 has a 13th Gen Intel Core processor. ASUS 3D display ASUS showed off a new type of 3D OLED display that can make images appear in three dimensions without requiring special glasses. The screen is featured in the ASUS ProArt StudioBook 16 and VivoBook Pro 16X laptops. The laptops use what ASUS calls Spatial Vision to deliver a 3D experience thats unlike anything weve seen on a laptop before. In addition to the screen itself the secret sauce behind the 3D tech is eye tracking which is built into both laptops. By following where a persons eyes are the laptop can make the images appear properly in front of the user. Its a difficult feature to show off in videos since it requires hardware that wont be available until later this year. One of the demos I experienced was a simple showcase of some 3D models and its hard to put into words how impressive they looked. The level of detail visible is remarkable said our managing editor Richard Devine. It takes a second or two for your eyes to adjust but otherwise it just feels well normal. ASUS also detailed its 2023 Strix lineup of gaming laptops at the event. Those PCs feature the latest hardware from Intel NVIDIA and AMD depending on the model you choose.

52,This year's blockbuster IPO is between a rock and a hard place: listing in New York or London won't change Arm's fortunes in brutal downturn,"The SoftBank-owned chip designer is set to return to public markets this year, but listing in New York or London won't change the difficulties ahead.",https://www.businessinsider.com/arm-ipo-faces-rough-ride-2023-brutal-downturn-weighs-listing-2023-1,This years blockbuster IPO is between a rock and a hard place listing in New York or London wont change Arms fortunes in brutal downturn ARM is preparing for an IPO in 2023 that couldnt come at a more tricky time. The SoftBankowned chip designer will enter the market during a brutal downturn. The listing of Arm on the stock exchange in 2023 is set to be one of the years standout IPOs but the timing for a blockbuster public market entry couldnt be worse. The UK chip designer bought by SoftBank in 2016 for 32 billion is being prepared for a return to the public markets this year by the Japanese conglomerates CEO Masayoshi Son in the midst of one of the most brutal market downturns in recent decades. An attempt by US chip giant Nvidia to buy Arm for 40 billion fell flat last year amid intense regulatory scrutiny. This pushed SoftBank to reposition Arm for the public markets as the Japanese firm seeks to generate profits from assets that can offset losses in its venture capital business. Arms relisting isnt quite as clearcut as SoftBank would like with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak upping efforts in December for a duallisting involving London according to the Financial Times. This triggered a tugofwar with the US over a company considered the crown jewel of UK tech. But its a battle whose outcome is likely to prove futile either way for Arm a chip firm behind proprietary designs that find themselves in the worlds leading smartphones and cars with its fortunes even less clearcut in a future fraught with risk. Squashed investor appetite for speculative tech firms and a brutal downturn for the chip sector means SoftBanks attempt to steam ahead with listing Arm to support its own balance sheet woes in 2023 could prove to be more turbulent than it needs to be. The IPO door remains mostly shut Few other privately held tech companies itching for a public listing are rushing to market at a time when the IPO window appears all but shut. Figures from EY suggest that after a record year of listings in 2021 last years IPO market went into reverse mode. Deal volumes fell 45 and proceeds dropped by 61 in the face of reduced appetite for more speculative stocks against a backdrop of soaring interest rates. There is no sign of that trend changing in 2023. On Saturday after it emerged that fintech giant Ant Financial would no longer be under the control of Chinese billionaire Jack Ma the company confirmed to Reuters that it had no plans to carry out an IPO. Its previous plans to raise 37 billion in an IPO in late 2020 fell over after Chinese regulators introduced new lending rules. Any future plans for an IPO in the nearterm seem all but diminished as investors have become even more cautious around Chinas creeping involvement in markets that are at their most volatile in more than a decade. Others are biding their time too. Tech darlings in the West have all been points of conversation in recent years when it comes to techs next big IPO but few have signaled direct intent to go public as markets go through their rough and tumble moment. A Klarna IPO had been talked up right until it was forced to take a significant down round that slashed its valuation from 46 billion to 6. 7 billion. Meanwhile Stripe which filed plans with the SEC to go public in 2021 has been hesitant to make another move having laid off 14 of its staff towards the end of last year. SpaceX is another big company around which IPO talks have been swirling the rocket company led by Elon Musk. Given the challenges hes enduring with Twitter and Tesla adding to his headaches with a public listing for SpaceX seems unlikely though anything is possible with Musk. Plans to publicly list Arm have already been pushed back from early 2023 over concerns surrounding a market gripped by fear But the company is still on course for an IPO this year Ian Thorton Arms head of investor relations wrote in a letter in November. Clearly we want to IPO as soon as is possible. But given the current global economic uncertainty given the state of financial markets thats probably now unlikely to happen before the end of March 2023 the letter reportedly said. Chip sector in turmoil Arms other challenge with going public in 2023 lies in the state of the chip sector its down. Chip stocks in particular took a bruising in 2022 as supplychain crunches and shortages triggered by the Covid19 pandemic continued through the year with only some sign of letup for the sectors biggest players this year. Still many are continuing to suffer. Last week South Korean giant Samsung announced that its operating profits fell by almost 70 in its fourth quarter amid lower demand for chips spurred by reduced consumer spending on electronics and a chip oversupply. Former Arm pursuer Nvidia meanwhile has seen its shares take a hit following new license requirements implemented by the US government. In an SEC filing the company warned that the licenses would impact 400 million worth of sales to China in its third quarter last year. Such export controls have already hit Arm as it emerged last month that Alibaba was unable to buy chip designs from the British firm over fears that a license to sell highperformance designs to the Chinese tech giant wouldnt be approved. Such events are likely to spook wouldbe public investors in Arm at a time when they are belttightening. There are some signs that Arm would be insulated from some of the market tumult its growing focus on the car industry for instance has seen revenue for its automotive unit more than double since 2020 a rare spot of subsisting demand according to the Financial Times. But with chip revenue set to fall by almost 4 in 2023 to 596 billion per projections by Gartner it is hard not to think that any IPO of Arm may just be throwing it into treacherous waters.

53,NVIDIA relaunches 12GB RTX 4080 as the RTX 4070 Ti for $799,"NVIDIA scrubbed the launch of the 12GB RTX 4080 after user backlash, and the card is now being launched again under a new name. Say hello to the RTX 4070 Ti.",https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/nvidia-relaunches-12gb-rtx-4080-as-the-rtx-4070-ti-for-dollar799,NVIDIA relaunches 12GB RTX 4080 as the RTX 4070 Ti for 799 The 12GB version of the RTX 4080 is back in a new avatar. What you need to know NVIDIA has officially launched the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti for 799. The card is identical to the 12GB version of the RTX 4080 that debuted in November 2022 but was later scrubbed. NVIDIA isnt rolling out a Founders Edition variant of the RTX 4070 Ti. Back when NVIDIA introduced the GeForce RTX 4080 in November there were two variants a 16GB model and a 12GB version with tweaks to the memory bus width and number of cores for 899 300 less than the 16GB RTX 4080. However a lot of users took issue with the 12GB model and the backlash got to a point where NVIDIA scrubbed the variant altogether. It was a given that the model would launch under a different name and the brand is doing just that the 12GB RTX 4080 is back and it is now called the RTX 4070 Ti. The best part about the introduction of the RTX 4070 Ti is that it is debuting at 799 100 less than its asking figure when it was branded as the RTX 4080. Thats great news for gamers looking to get their hands on a card based on the new Ada Lovelace architecture. The new architecture brings exciting efficiency gains and huge performance uplifts with NVIDIA touting that the card is 3x faster than the mighty 2000 RTX 3090 Ti. Theres obviously a caveat associated with a claim like that but in my testing I found the RTX 4080 to be noticeably faster than the RTX 3090 Ti at 4K and QHD resolutions and the 4070 Ti is likely to be in a similar boat. NVIDIA hasnt shared much in the way of technical details just yet but given that it was officially launched in November the hardware is unchanged. That means were looking at 7680 cores 12GB of GDDR6X memory at a 192bit wide interface leading to a bandwidth of 504GBs. And coming in at a requirement of 285W the RTX 4070 Ti is a little more efficient than the 4080. The RTX 4070 Ti is turning out to be the best GPU for customers still on the GTX 1080 Ti or the firstgen RTX 2080 and NVIDIA notes that the card is able to provide a 12x relative performance upgrade over the 1080 Ti. Sales of the RTX 4070 Ti will kick off starting January 5 for 799 and notably NVIDIA isnt offering a Founders Edition version of the card it will only be available with AIB vendors like Zotac ASUS MSI Gigabyte Colorful and others.

54,How to Fix Nvidia GeForce Drivers Not Downloading or Installing,The latest drivers will let you make the most out of your Nvidia GPU. But what should you do if you can't download and install them?,https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-nvidia-geforce-drivers-not-downloading-or-installing/,Having trouble downloading graphics drivers with Nvidia GeForce Experience or its other tools Have you tried installing the downloaded drivers only to find that they do not follow your directions If so you may not be able to fully utilize the powerful graphics card youve purchased for hundreds of dollars from Nvidia. Why does this happen So lets explore why Nvidia drivers wont download or install on your device and what you can do about it. How to Fix Nvidia Drivers Not Downloading on Windows There are two primary reasons why Nvidia drivers do not download the automatic download setting is disabled or there is a problem with the Nvidia graphics software itself. Here are the steps you need to follow to fix it. 1. Enable Automatic Downloads in the Nvidia GeForce Experience Client To enable the automatic downloads in the Nvidia GeForce client follow the below steps Launch GeForce Experience by searching for GeForce Experiencein Windows Search. In the topright corner click Settings gear icon. In the left sidebar click the Generaltab. Then scroll down to the bottom of the Generalsettings page and check the box for Automatically download driver updates and let me choose when to install. Close the Nvidia client and relaunch it after that. Then select the Drivers tab on the clients home screen and youll find the latest update available for installation. If you dont see any click the Check For Updates box which will load the latest update. If that doesnt help move on to the next step. 2. Manually Download the Drivers If the above method doesnt work you can manually download and install the driver. Here are the steps you need to follow. Go to the Nvidia Driver Downloads page. Choose the correct Product Type Product Series and Product. Next choose the proper Operating System. Select Game Ready Driver GRDfrom the Download Typedropdown menu. Click on the Searchbutton once the correct options have been selected. Depending on the hardware Nvidia will find the appropriate driver. Click on the Downloadbutton. Thats it. If Nvidia Experience or any other Nvidia client fails to download the driver automatically you can manually download them. But what if they dont install after downloading How to Fix Nvidia Drivers Not Installing on Windows Nvidia drivers fail to install due to interference from Windows security protection or an antivirus app protecting your device using an outdated Nvidia GeForce client downloading an incompatible driver that is not supported by your graphics card having a physical connection issue or having an outdated operating system. If Nvidia software fails to install drivers follow these steps. 1. Turn Off Antivirus Protection The Windows Defender or thirdparty antivirus software helps us catch viruses before they cause havoc on our devices. There are times however when they dont let even the safetoexecute processes complete because they consider them a threat. Firstly you should ensure that antivirus or Windows Defender doesnt interfere with the drivers installation. Disabling them is the best way to accomplish this. Not sure how to disable Windows builtin security Check out our guide on how to disable Windows Defender. Additionally if youre using any thirdparty antivirus software refer to the official instructions on their website explaining how to turn them off. After disabling them try installing the drivers again. Reenable Windows Defender or your antivirus after successfully installing the drivers. You could put your device at risk otherwise. 2. Ensure Windows Is UptoDate Running an outdated Windows OS can also impede the installation of drivers just as outdated GeForce Experience clients can cause problems. Therefore make sure that no operating system updates are pending. Our guide on managing Windows Updates will show you how to check for the most recent updates and install them. 3. Rule Out Compatibility Issues Your Nvidia drivers may also fail to install if youre trying to install incompatible drivers. Every graphics card requires a different driver. Hence the Nvidia client will simply give up if the driver you are trying to install does not match your hardware. Thus you should carefully check the graphics card installed on your device then manually download the driver corresponding to your hardware per the instructions about manually downloading drivers. If you are confident that your drivers are compatible with your hardware proceed to the next step. 4. Install the Driver Manually If the Nvidia client cannot install the drivers you can install them manually. To do that follow the instructions listed above for downloading drivers manually. When the driver has been downloaded rightclick the driver installer package and click Run as administrator. After that follow the onscreen instructions to install the drivers manually. 5. Install an Older Driver Version Are you trying to install a newly released driver Occasionally newly released drivers contain bugs that prevent them from installing. If you encounter this issue with a driver released recently by Nvidia try installing an older version. If the old version installs smoothly the problem must be with the new drivers. The Nvidia forum can be an excellent place to confirm this since other users may also have the same issue. If they are then wait for Nvidia to fix the problem. You can stick with the older version until then. 6. Reinstall the GeForce Experience Client If none of the above fixes helps you install the drivers your last resort should be to uninstall the GeForce Experience or any other client youre using and reinstall it. This will undoubtedly be timeconsuming. However it will save you from having to deal with this issue again in the future. For a successful reinstall uninstall your current installation and delete any junk files on your system. In some cases remnants of some client files may remain in the following locations which will need to be manually deleted CProgram FilesNVIDIA Corporation CProgram Files x86NVIDIA Corporation Smoothly Download and Install Nvidia Drivers Being unable to download and install newly released drivers can be tempting. If you follow the fixes in the list you should be able to download and install Nvidia drivers seamlessly. If the fixes dont work you can use thirdparty tools to update your drivers.,2023-01-11T22:00:06Z

However the autonomous vehicle market remains in its infancy with many of the enabling technologies still under active development. Israelbased Mobileye may have won early credibility among automakers like BMW Nissan Volkswagen and Chinas Zeekr but its not the only chipmaker eager to claim their share of the autonomous vehicle hype. At GTC last fall Nvidia unveiled its nextgeneration autonomous driving platform called Drive Thor. Based on the companys Hopper microarchitecture the system will reportedly deliver 2000 TOPS trillion operations per second of inferencing performance when it rolls out to automakers in 2025. Thats about the time Mobileye plans to launch its sixthgen EyeQ chips. Qualcomms Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC announced at the Consumer Electronics Show CES in Vegas this week is expected to hit the road a year earlier. Much like Nvidias Drive Thor the chip integrates multiple vehicle domains like infotainment ADAS and autonomous driving into a single platform. According to a Gartner report from September these autonomous vehicle AI chips which ingest and process the streaming data from vehicle sensors are among the more accessible technologies necessary to realize the dream of fully autonomous vehicles in the near term but theyre only part of the equation. Qualcomm Nvidia gain share steal customers In the six years since Intel acquired Mobileye for 15 billion the division has gained steady traction growing revenues quarter over quarter often by doubledigit margins. After much anticipation Intel spun off the division in an initial public offering IPO last October. However the IPO mustered just 16 billion a fraction of the nearly 50 billion valuation the division had hoped to fetch earlier in the year. Despite a somewhat lackluster entrance to the public market the company still leads Nvidia and Qualcomm at least when it comes to revenues. During Mobileyes first quarter as a publicly traded company it posted revenues of 450 million. Including the three quarters leading up to the companys IPO its 2022 revenues topped 1. 66 billion. By comparison Qualcomms automotive business managed 1. 4 billion while Nvidias netted just 566 million during the 2022 fiscal year. Tesla driver blames fullselfdriving software for eightcar Thanksgiving Day pile up Waymo selfdriving robotaxi goes rogue with passenger inside escapes support staff Intels Mobileye unveils first productiongrade fully electric selfdriving vehicle partners with Sixt for Munich launch When the chips fall Intel preps for 16b Mobileye IPO And while Shashua was quick to highlight the companys 17 billion in bookings Qualcomm claims its order pipeline is nearly twice that with General Motors Renault Volkswagen and BMW lining up to purchase its Snapdragon Ride Flex platform. If some of those names sound familiar thats because many of the same companies buying Mobileyes products today are also eyeing its competitors. Nvidia is also poised to steal customer share away from Mobileye. During his keynote Thursday Shashua touted automaker Zeekr which has already put 70000 vehicles using its ADAS platform on the road. But as we learned at GTC Zeekr was also one of Nvidias launch partners for Drive Thor. Robotaxis first autonomous vehicles later Interest in autonomous vehicles is gaining momentum quickly stoked by everimproving ADAS systems like Teslas Autopilot or GMs Super Cruise. Looking ahead Gartner predicts that by 2028 the number of assisted autonomous vehicles think lane keeping automatic cruise control and braking will increase to just under 75 percent up from 60 percent in 2020. Analysts expect more capable systems which Gartner refers to as partially autonomous will jump from 1. 5 percent of vehicles in 2020 to a quarter of all vehicles by 2030. This class reflects the kinds of handsoff autonomous driving capabilities available in some premium vehicles today. Where Gartner expects to see the most advanced fully autonomous systems first isnt in a vehicle youll be able to buy. Instead analysts believe that the first fully autonomous vehicles will show up in the form of robotaxis. Today a handful of companies have fielded autonomous taxis usually with a driver on board as a failsafe. Waymo and Sixt are just two examples. By 2025 Gartner expects robotaxis will be fairly common with services available in at least 25 cities in North America. But just like autonomous vehicles robotaxis face safety concerns. In 2021 a Waymo robotaxi went rogue evading support staff while Autopilotrelated crashes continue to be a source of controversy for Teslas Muskmobiles.,2023-01-06T16:15:11Z

The post Nvidia wants to stream GeForce NOW games into your car appeared first on BGR.",https://bgr.com/tech/nvidia-wants-to-stream-geforce-now-games-into-your-car/,Nvidia wants to bring cloud gaming right into your car. In a press release Nvidia announced that it is working to bring GeForce NOW the companys game streaming service directly into cars. The company says that it will take no additional hardware besides you know adding screens and processors and that it is already working with Hyundai Motor Group BYD and Polestar to launch the service in their vehicles. Stella Li Vice President of BYD and CEO of BYD America hailed the partnership. We are excited to offer our customers the best in technology comfort design from BYD and now the latest in gaming through NVIDIA GeForce NOW highperformance cloud gaming service. The experience of driving our cars is becoming increasingly sophisticated entertaining and sustainable. You can check out what it might look like in their announcement video below While you may be jumping at the screen screaming that drivers will turn the highway into an actual recreation of Grand Theft Auto due to their eyes being locked into the game dont worry. The company notes that drivers and front seat passengers can access games while parked or charging while those in the backseat of vehicles where rear entertainment is enabled can play anytime on the road. The gaming service seems to be coming only to vehicles that feature the companys NVIDIA DRIVE technology something that Hyundai BYD and Polestar all have. Nvidia says it should work with over 1000 titles on the service that support a controller and press images appear to indicate it will work with the Xbox Wireless Controller. Nvidia and the automakers did not provide a launch date for the service on any of their cars so we could have quite a wait. However if successful Nvidia could beat other game streaming services like Xbox Cloud Gaming to bring cloud gaming to the car. I for one am ready to play Battlefield while Im charging my electric car at Whole Foods. What a time to be alive,2023-01-03T23:33:16Z

Meanwhile the TCL lineup starts at 129 launching initially in Europe before coming to the US and all three variants include a 50megapixel main camera. All signs point to increasing manufacturer interest in the budget phone market. Smartwatches want to know if youre OK Smartwatches to track heart rate sleep quality and bloodoxygen levels abound but Citizen takes it a step further with its CZ Smart watch which also measures fatigue and alertness levels. Itll even tell you your chronotype that is whether youre a night owl or an early bird. Its another sign that smartwatchmakers are focusing more and more on measuring the way sleep and stress impact overall wellbeing. BMWs concept car doubles as your buddy Technology can be so impersonal. BMWs i Vision Dee hopes to fix that. Using sophisticated AI this concept car ditches the servant schtick of Siri and Alexa. Instead it hopes to double as both your car and your friend. The i Vision Dee is an EV sports car with an exterior of 240 E Ink panels. You can use those panels to program a digital face into the cars grille because its an EV the ventilation that grilles typically provide isnt actually needed or change the cars colors at the click of a button. The BMW i Vision Dee is for now just a concept but some of its features will trickle out to BMWs actual cars. BMW CEO Oliver Zipse said for instance that the AIpowered HUB technology the company put into the i Vision Dee will come to real cars in 2025. The thinnest gaming laptop in the world Alienware surprised us with four new laptops ahead of CES including the Alienware x14 which the company said is the thinnest 14inch gaming laptop in the world. Featuring a 2560x1600pixel display with a 165Hz refresh rate itll sell from 1799 when it ships this winter. A bigger version the Alienware x16 starts at 3099. These laptops are for people who are willing to sacrifice some power for slicker designs. Read more Best Gaming Laptops From CES 2023 So Far Invisible laptop touchpads LG showed off its new Gram Style laptop which features a hidden touchpad that presents itself only when you touch the palm rest. The stealthy haptic touchpad lights up under your fingers when touched showing you where to tap and drag to navigate the screen. Its a neat detail we didnt know we wanted. A giant leap for PC gamers who also use consoles Dells Concept Nyx gaming controller looks at first glance like just another thirdparty Xbox controller albeit with some fancy lights. Alas its more than that. The Nyx controller is tricked out with a bunch of hidden inputs which multiply the functionality of the controller. The idea seems to be to bridge the gap between a gamepad and a keyboard. PC gamers are able to use hotkey setups to have dozens of inputs far more than the typical gamepad which is often limited to the options presented by a dpad. That means they can use a wider range of attacks in an MMO for instance or cycle between six or seven guns in a firstperson shooter rather than the two or three that console gamers are often limited to. Roku has entered the chat Roku announced its expanding into TVs essentially competing with its own partnerships with more established TVmakers such as TCL Hisense and Sharp. The move has long been rumored and makes a lot of sense for the streaming devicemaker. Roku TVs will come with the brands Voice Remotes which include the popular and everuseful find my remote feature. Looks like LG and Samsung have some new competition. Upgrades coming to your laptops brains Sleek displays and dazzling screens are nice but often its the tech you dont see that matters most. Intel unveiled a boatload of new 13thgeneration processors which will power a huge range of products and improve performance on a wide range of laptops. Less abstract than chip performance are the upgrades they can yield. The new generation of Intel CPUs bring with them Unison which lets iPhone and Android devices send and receive texts from your PC as well as Thunderbolt 4 which among other improvements will set as a standard the ability to run two 4K external displays. Expect to see these features in product announcements over the next few days. Then there was AMDs press conference. Much of what the company touted was its prograde tech like the AMD chips that were used to build Avatar 2s visual effects. As far as products you can actually buy AMD has partnered with HP for the Dragonfly Pro a laptop designed for freelancers and Lenovo for new Legion Pro gaming laptops. For PC gamers AMDs highend Ryzen 7 7800X3D and 7950X3D processors are coming this year. Cloud gaming now in your car Chief among Nvidias announcements are improvements to GeForce Now its cloud gaming service which allows you to stream games on laptops phones and more. In short the power of Nvidias GeForce 4080 GPU is coming to the cloud. If you subscribe to the premium tier of GeForce Now henceforth known as GeForce Now Ultimate you can now stream games at 240Hz utilize ray tracing which significantly improves how light is rendered ingame and DLSS 3 which uses an algorithm to boost frame rate while retaining image quality. Plus GeForce Now is coming to... cars. If your car has a screen on its dash you can play while the car is in park. If there are screens behind the driver or passenger seats those sitting in the back can game on the go. For starters Nvidia is partnering with Hyundai BYB and Polestar.,2023-01-10T03:02:00Z

While these cover the majority of computing needs especially gaming they arent the only personal computers available to us today. Thanks to advancements in technology we have a variety of devices available today that make computing more mobile more efficient and even more personal. At CES 2023 Lenovo is showing off how it goes beyond regular computers with its most powerful tablet yet a new ePaper solution and the next step in bringing mixed reality to your living room. Designer Lenovo Lenovo Tab Extreme There was a point in time when it seemed that tablets were on the way out. As smartphones became bigger the need for tablets with big screens became almost pointless. Recently however the tablet has taken on a new mission as a true mobile computer almost like a laptop replacement and Lenovo is taking that to the extreme with its biggest and most powerful tablet yet clearly designed for more than just watching videos. Of course its also a delight to do that on the Lenovo Tab Extreme thanks to its spacious 14. 5inch 3K 120Hz OLED screen and eight highperformance JBL 4channel speakers. The tablet shines brightest however when used for more than just consumption but also for creation whether its a work of art or a work document. The MediaTek Dimensity 9000 12GB of RAM and Android 13 all work together to deliver this productivity experience on the go and the gigantic 12300mAh battery ensures youll have as little downtime as possible. Beyond just the specs the Lenovo Tab Extreme is designed to be flexible and stylish in any situation. A magnetic dualmode stand makes it convenient to prop up the tablet horizontally or vertically while the optional dualhinge keyboard lifts it up for a more ergonomic position while you type your next great novel. The tablet can even be used as a digital sketchpad by plugging it in via its DPin USBC port or as a second monitor through the DPout port. The Lenovo Tab Extreme will be available later this year with a starting price of 1199. 99. Lenovo Smart Paper Not everyone needs a fullblown tablet though. There are some who just need the digital equivalent of a notebook one that blends the conveniences of mobile tech with the universality of pen and paper. Fortunately there is a new breed of devices that promise exactly that and the new Lenovo Smart Paper takes the lead in combining digital and analog in a smart and meaningful way. Powered by a 10. 3inch EInk display the Lenovo Smart Paper presents the perfect size for a paper notebook one that does away with wasteful paper without giving up on the experience of using a pen. Its all digital of course but the feeling and texture of guiding the Smart Paper Pen over the ePaper display are as close as you can get to the real thing. And like a normal pen or pencil you dont need to worry about batteries or charging the pen as well. The device is specifically designed to make taking notes not only enjoyable but also efficient. With two integrated microphones you can record a meeting or lecture while youre scribbling down notes. And when its time to review those notes simply select the written text to hear a playback of the recorded audio to help jog your memory. The Lenovo Smart Paper is expected to launch sometime this year for 399. 99. Lenovo Project Chronos Most of the computing devices we have today come in the form of something we can touch be it a laptop a tablet or a smartphone. The future of computing however might be less tangible. Buzzwords aside the metaverse and mixed reality represent an inescapable future but its a future thats hindered by clunky headsets and devices. Lenovo is taking a plunge into this stillgestating market with an innovative concept device that removes the need to weigh your body down just so that you can move your virtual avatar. Project Chronos is basically a box with a camera that can keep track of your body movement to control a virtual character often your avatar. It uses advanced depth cameras and algorithms to recreate your movement within a 3D environment without having to wear glasses or mocap sensors. It can even track your facial expressions so that your avatar can truly express your emotions just as your own body can sometimes betray you in the physical world. Despite that seemingly magical capability Project Chronos is designed for home use and its simple and discreet design can easily blend with the rest of your entertainment system. You simply connect the box to a TV or monitor and youre good to go. And once youre done you can rotate the camera down to ensure your privacy. This gearfree mixed reality device opens a whole new world of applications from creating content with a VTuber avatar to getting personalized realtime coaching from a fitness expert. The Lenovo Project Chronos however is still a concept and work in progress and its full name and capabilities will be disclosed when its ready to launch.,2023-01-05T16:00:13Z
61,How to Stream PC Games on NVIDIA Shield TV via Steam Link,"Steam Link isn't as good as NVIDIA GameStream, but if you're a Shield TV user who wants to stream games from your PC, you have no other option.",https://www.makeuseof.com/stream-games-on-nvidia-shield-tv-via-steam-link/,If you want to stream PC games to your NVIDIA Shield TV NVIDIA recommends using Steam Link. And while its not the only available option Steam Link can be a worthy replacement to the nowdefunct GameStream service. In this article we explain everything you need to know about Steam Link and how to use it to stream games to an NVIDIA Shield TV. What Is Steam Link First lets clear up what were talking about when we refer to Steam Link. Were not referring to the hardware variant of Steam Linkwhich was discontinued in 2018 and replaced with the Steam Link app. When we refer to Steam Link in this guide were referring to the app not the hardware. With that clarification out of the way how does it all work Steam Link streams games from your gaming PC to the device you wish to stream to in our case your Shield TV by bridging a connection between the two. Setup is straightforward though you may encounter caveats once you try to stream. But more on that later. Its a decent option when you want to stream PC games to your Shield TV especially with NVIDIA discontinuing GameStream. Even though youll be limited to Steams ecosystem you can still play games from other digital marketplaces by adding nonSteam games to your Steam library. How to Install and Set Up Steam Link on NVIDIA Shield TV Open the Play Store app on your Shield TV search for Steam Link. and then select Install Open Allow. Now Steam Link will search the PCs currently running Steam. In most cases your PC will be found automatically. If not youll have to manually add the PC more on that in a moment. Now lets bridge the connection between your gaming PC and the Shield TV. Heres how Select the gaming PC you want to connect to. Choose Start Playing. Take note of the fourdigit PIN that appears. Go to the gaming PC you want to connect to and enter the code in the blank field. Select Confirm. If you have more than one gaming PC running Steam on your home network and want to bridge another connection to your Shield TV select Settings and then Computer to see every PC found by Steam Link. Select a computer you want to steam from then select Start Playing to bridge another connection. Thats it But what can you do if Steam Link fails to find your gaming PC on your home network Thats an easy fix so read below. What to Do if Steam Link Cant Find Your PC If Steam Link cant find the PC you want to stream games from to your Shield TV go to Settings Computer Rescan to see if it can be found a second time around. But if the Steam Link app still cannot find your gaming PC youll have to add it manually. Fortunately Steam Link also makes this process simple. So follow these simple instructions Go to Settings Computer. Now select Other Computerat the bottom. Take note of the fourdigit PIN. Open the Steam client on the gaming PC you want to stream from. Now click on Steam Settings and head to Remote Play on the left pane. Enter the fourdigital PIN and select Confirm as we did in the previous example. If successful the Steam Link app will bridge a connection between the PC and your Shield TV. Connecting a Controller to the Shield TV Android and iOS users may already know that they dont necessarily need to connect a controller if they want to stream their PC titles to their mobile devices. But since the goal is to stream PC games to the Shield TV we dont have that option. So well need to pair a Bluetooth controller to your Shield TV. You can skip this step if youve done this in the past. For everyone else you have two options Pairing a Steam Controller with the Shield TV. Pairing other controllers like DualSense and Xbox Series XS controllers. For the few that still own a Steam Controller and wish to pair it to the Shield TV first update the Steam Controllers firmware. To do this Open Steam on your PC where the Steam Controller is paired. Click on Viewand choose Big Picture Modefrom the dropdown menu. Now follow the onscreen instructions for updating the firmware if an update is available. Turn off the Steam Controller by holding the Steambutton. To pair any Bluetooth controller to your Shield TV including the Steam Controller follow the instructions below Select Settingsand choose Remotes accessories. Hold the pairing button on your controller. Select Add Bluetooth accessories. Using your Shield TV remote choose the controller you are pairing. Select Pair. To unpair a controller from the Shield TV go to Settings Remotes accessories and go to the bottom of the list to find your connected controller under the Paired devices section. Select the controller then choose Unpair. Troubleshooting Steam Links Latency Issues Although not everyone will experience latency issues with Steam Link its a common problem. Unfortunately latency woes can occur for any number of reasons. If youre getting undesirable bandwidth speeds via Steam Link conduct a bandwidth test on the PC you want to stream to your Shield TV. You can do this within Steam Link itself. Select Settings Streaming Network Test. Enter the fourdigit PIN on the gaming PC you want to stream to the Shield TV and then select Confirm to conduct a speed test. If your connection crawls at a turtles pace consider plugging your gaming PC into an Ethernet port on your home network. Alternatively switch your PC from 2. 4GHz to 5GHz. Additionally you can enable hardware encoding to minimize latency woes by opening the Steam client on your PC and going to Steam Settings Remote Play Advanced Host Options Enable hardware encoding OK. While youre on the Steam client its a good time to adjust the stream quality of your gaming PC. Return to Settings then select Remote Play. Look for the section Client options streaming to this computer at the bottom of the page. You will find three choices Fast Balanced and Beautiful. By default Steam sets this to Balanced but if your connection is slow make sure you choose Fast. Steam Link Is the Next Best Thing to GameStream Steam Link isnt perfect and it may make you feel nostalgic for the days when you could stream from your gaming PC to your Shield TV via NVIDIAs GameStream service. Still its arguably the easiest solution for streaming your PC games to the Shield TV. If you have a few minutes to spare follow our guide and see if Steam Link streams optimally on your home network.,2022-12-23T11:15:16Z
62,"Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 12GB becomes the RTX 4070 Ti, starting at $799","Nvidia's latest desktop GPU promises to be three times faster than an RTX 3090 Ti at nearly half the power. However, there's no Founders Edition.",https://www.xda-developers.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-ces-2023/,In addition to the new lineup of GeForce RTX 40 series laptop GPUs Nvidia is introducing the new GeForce RTX 4070 Ti desktop GPU today. This is essentially a rebranded version of the Nvidia RTX 4080 12GB which was announced last September and quickly relaunched a few weeks later due to backlash from the community. Nvidia is rebranding it as a lowertier GPU and launching at a lower 799 price tag 100 below the original price of the RTX 4080 12GB. Performance and availability Nvidia claims the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is up to three times faster than a GeForce RTX 3090 Ti while using nearly half the power. This is thanks to support for DLSS 3 which includes deeplearning frame generation technology to create additional frames in supported games without using traditional rendering. Frame generation can greatly improve framerates though latency tends to increase to more typical rendering. The GPU also includes two AV1 encoders for faster highquality video rendering. Since its the same hardware as the canceled RTX 4080 12GB it has 7680 cores and 12GB of GDDR6X memory. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is set to be available later this week on January 5th. interestingly Nvidia is opting not to launch a Founders Edition version of the card so it will only be available from board partners. More DLSS games on the way and Nvidia Studio features Along with the announcement of the new GPU Nvidia also announced today that more games are adding support for DLSS 3 as well as some games also adding support for DLSS 2 which doesnt include frame generation. Games adding support for DLSS 3 include Marvels Midnight Suns which is adding support via nan update later this month. Upcoming games like Witchfire and Atomic Heart will also launch later this year with support for the technology. Additionally Dead Space is launching on January 27th with support for DLSS 2. For content creators there are a few new features across the Nvidia Studio apps. Nvidia Omniverse is getting enhancements for Blender and new experimental generative AI tools and the Nvidia RTX Remix modding platform will enter early access soon. This allows users to easily create and share mods for classic games including adding support for ray tracing and enhanced materials. Nvidia Broadcast is getting enhancements like a new eye contact feature as well as improvements for virtual backgrounds. Additionally Nvidia Canvas is introducing 360degree images that can be used as environment maps for 3D apps. Finally theres a new RTX Super Resolution a new feature that will be enabled in web browsers like Chrome and Microsoft Edge. This uses AI to enhance the quality of video playback removing compression artifacts and upscaling the video resolution of online content. This will be available in the February release of Chrome and Edge. New Nvidia GeForce Now Ultimate tier with RTX 4080 One last but of news out of CES is the new Nvidia GeForce Now Ultimate tier which is powered by Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 GPUs. The new Nvidia SuperPODs powered by these GPUs promises up to 1. 75x the performance of the previous generation and 5x more performance than an Xbox Series X. With support for DLSS 3 players can stream games at up to 240 frames per second with full ray tracing including games like Portal with RTX. Nvidia also claims clicktopixel latency of just 40 milliseconds which is a first for cloud gaming. The new Nvidia GeForce Now Ultimate tier is basically a rebranded version of the RTX 3080 tier and its available today for the same price at 19. 99 per month or 99. 99 for six months. The upgraded streaming experience will start rolling out later this month in North America and Europe with further expansion in the coming months.,2023-01-03T17:04:22Z
63,We're entering a horrible era: bad names for laptop chips,"AMD, Intel, and Nvidia have been introducing some god awful names for laptop chips. Why is this happening?",https://www.xda-developers.com/terrible-names-for-laptop-chips/,The announcement of Ryzen 7000 mobile and the GTX 40 series for laptops brings us into a new chip generation but also at the end of an era where naming schemes and nomenclature for laptop processors were accurate intuitive and relatively simple to understand. We wont sugarcoat it the names AMD Nvidia and Intel have come up with for their new chips are terrible. We find ourselves doublechecking what a processor actually is because its name no longer says anything useful or informative. We thought we were seeing improvements after years of horrible naming conventions but were going backwards. So what happened The end of an era of openness Back in the old days laptop CPUs and GPU naming schemes were terrible. You might think a GeForce GTX 980M was just a mobile version of the GeForce GTX 980 but in fact it had just 75 of the cores. Meanwhile Intel and AMD CPUs had a totally different nomenclature compared to their desktop chips. This prevented assumptions about the relationships between similarly named desktop and mobile parts but it meant you had to learn two different naming schemes for each brand. Things started to change in 2016. With its GTX 10 series Nvidia began to name laptop GPUs similarly to how it named its desktop GPUs. A GTX 1080 was a GTX 1080 whether it was in your desktop or your laptop with the same core count and memory amount. When Intel launched its Coffee Lake CPUs in 2017 the company also introduced eighthgeneration Hclass CPUs that mostly followed the same naming scheme the desktop eighthgeneration chips did. AMD never completely unified the nomenclature of its desktop and laptop parts but did make significant progress in developing a decent naming scheme. A GTX 1080 was a GTX 1080 whether it was in your desktop or your laptop. Of course this system wasnt perfect. A GTX 1080 in a laptop is always slower than a GTX 1080 in a desktop because laptops have stricter power and heat limits. That means clock speeds have to come down leading to lower performance. Different laptops have different power and cooling capabilities so one laptops 1080 wasnt always the same as anothers for example. This was a key complaint about mobile components when companies did away with M prefixes and wholly unique nomenclature. I strongly disagree with those complaints because naming schemes arent just about performance but what youre buying. You can and should expect to pay lots of money for a highend RTX 3080 GPU whether its in a desktop or a laptop and you can also expect it will be a higherend GPU relative to other options. The naming was both clear and honest and it worked. However thats now dead with the announcement of nextgeneration CPUs and GPUs. The RTX 4090 mobile is probably one of the most highprofile examples of this new nomenclature. Its just an RTX 4080 Intel hasnt gotten much flak for its situation with 13th Gen but thats probably because only higherend CPUs like the 13900H which has 10 fewer cores than the Core i913900K and 13900HX have notably bad names. Im particularly worried about AMDs naming scheme catching on as obfuscating architectural differences is especially misleading. AMD even made a whole generation exclusively for its APUs just to avoid confusion about architecture and series names and now most Ryzen 7000 mobile CPUs dont use Zen 4 instead using the older Zen 2 and 3 architectures. Accuracy has gone out the window and as a user names are no longer intuitive. Companies want to eat their cake and have it too There are a couple of reasons why Nvidia AMD and Intel are all moving away from good nomenclature at the same time. Mainly its getting harder and harder to squeeze efficiency gains out of each generation of new hardware. Laptops live and die on how efficient they are because as previously discussed there are power and heat limits. Its why new desktop CPUs and GPUs are increasing in power which is the only way to meet expectations of continuously growing performance on the higher end. Its just not economical to put a full 4090 into a laptop because its clock speed has to go way down to meet power and heat limitations. When power is limited highend processors cant stretch their legs and they end up being about as fast as lowerend models. This has always been an issue but now its worse than ever before which becomes a huge problem when youre naming desktop and laptop parts similarly. So why doesnt Nvidia just limit itself to the 4080 and leave the 4090 off the table It wouldnt be unusual there wasnt a 1080 Ti 2080 Ti or 3090 for laptops. In the same vein Intel didnt need to name a 14core CPU the same as one associated with a 24core processor and AMD doesnt need to use the Ryzen 7000 branding for CPUs that belonged to other series. These companies want to use the highend branding theyve been using for years and theyre not going to let the technical specifications get in the way. Ultimately it just comes down to branding. These companies want to use the highend branding theyve been using for years on desktop and laptop components and theyre not going to let the technical specifications get in the way of that. They can even use higherend branding more freely for components that wouldnt otherwise fit the requirements. It was probably inevitable it would end up this way no matter how great or small the efficiency gains were but steadily decreasing generational improvements certainly sped things up. The result is the worst naming system weve ever seen. Its similar to what we had in the pre2016 era except without the prefixes that tell you mobile parts arent the same as desktop parts. Instead seemingly minor number and character differences now denote completely distinct processors in the most important ways. Ultimately were all left wondering if what were paying for is actually worth the money. Either add an M or change the names I get it naming a processor is difficult. Its hard to express all the little intricacies in a name with four or five numbers and a letter or two. However thats not a license to act as if names dont mean anything. At the very least I expect product names to convey the value of the part in question. The cost of producing an RTX 4080 is much lower than that of an RTX 4090 but Im sure an RTX 4090 laptop GPU which is actually an RTX 4080 will be priced based on its name not its specifications. If Nvidia AMD and Intel want to use these highend and currentgen names they need to add a clear marker that signifies whats what. I think wed all be fine with the RTX 4090M even if it still costs an arm and a leg. Right now were getting the worst of both worlds and my biggest fear is that this scheme will be so profitable that its permanent. On the other hand lots of terrible decisions have been reversed or corrected with enough criticism and Im hoping next generation well see a course change.,2023-01-11T14:01:16Z

Nvidia has announced new GeForce gaming laptops powered by the RTX 40 series. Over 170 laptop models from all major manufactures will be gradually released starting on February 8. The new line includes graphic cards from all across the RTX 40 line including the 4080 4070 4060 4050 and even the 4090for the first time on a laptop. New GeForce 40 series laptops are up to three times more efficient than the previous set of laptops. The energy efficiency is in part because of how they ship with the lowest voltage GDDR6 memory yet and how the trispeed memory control lets the GPU switch to lowerpower memory states automatically. With Ada Lovelace architecture Nvidia DLSS 3 and fifthgeneration MaxQ tech 40 series laptops can provide four times faster performance. Creatives can also take advantage of the chips power to cut export times with dual AV1 encoders. Flagship laptops with 4080 and 4090 cards start at 1999 and will start to be available on February.

66,AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX vs. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080,Should you go for AMD's Radeon RX 9700 XTX or NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 4080?,https://www.xda-developers.com/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xtx-vs-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080/,One of the most important components of any gaming PC is the graphics card. Its what will be handling all the processing to deliver video output to an external monitor. The more powerful the GPU the higher the possible frame rate the higher the supported resolution and the more you can be expected to pay. Striking a balance between affordability and performance will land you the best graphics card for your system. Were going to be looking at the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX vs. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 right here to help you decide between the two. Source AMD AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX AMD strikes back at NVIDIAs RTX 40 series with the impressive AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. This new flagship may not be the most powerful GPU around but it can easily handle 4K gaming. Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 is a midrange graphics card designed for 1440p and 4K gaming. Rocking all the latest NVIDIA tech this is one capable GPU. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 may be a little too powerful and expensive which is where the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 comes into play. It may be priced considerably higher than the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX but the ingame performance is largely comparable between the two with AMD more often than not coming out on top. Both GPUs are capable of driving 2K 1440p and 4K 2160p monitors with excellent gaming experiences. If youre not too fussed about value and performance per dollar the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 may be the better choice for you especially if you prefer the companys drivers. AMD is our recommendation however thanks to the price performance and likelihood of considerable gains through platform and driver maturity. RX 7900 XTX vs. RTX 4080 Price and availability The two graphics cards were launched in 2022 and AMD came to the market a little later in the year with the RX 7900 XTX. The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX costs 999 as the MSRP. This undercuts the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 by 200 a considerable sum of money considering both graphics cards are very comparable on paper and ingame. The AMD GPU does come out on top in tests though this quickly flips when ray tracing is enabled. NVIDIAs technologies are more mature than AMD allowing the company to ramp up performance in heavier areas. We expect AMD to improve the overall experience of the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX through driver updates as this generation ages. Architecture AMD RDNA 3 is the latest generation of architecture used as a base for the Radeon 7900 series of GPUs. The same goes for Ada Lovelace with the RTX 40 series from NVIDIA. These two platforms are excellent for gaming and are the result of decades of research and development from both sides. Like AMD vs. Intel for processors the two GPU brands have their own solutions. NVIDIA is sticking with a traditional configuration built on a 4nm process whilst AMD brought across its chiplet design from its CPU families. This allowed the company to effectively split up its GPU cores by having the graphic dies on a 5nm process and the smaller memory dies on a mature and less expensive 6nm process. This results in a cheaper design that allows AMD to ramp up its processing power. This is all new to AMD and the company continues to struggle to keep up with the performance of NVIDIA GPUs with ray tracing. Team green makes use of AIassisted calculations and when paired with its super sampling tech DLSS the results are spectacular. AMD has made a notable improvement with RDNA 3 and the RX 7900 XTX but it still falls short of what the RTX 4080 is capable of. Performance Whether you choose the Radeon RX 7900 XTX or GeForce RTX 4080 youll have a very powerful graphics card. Connecting either to a 2K or 4K monitor will result in an incredible experience. Weve compiled a list of game benchmark test results below to show just how close these GPUs are aside from when ray tracing is activated. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 has the lead in almost all games when ray tracing is activated at 2K and 4K resolutions. Which GPU is best This is a difficult question to answer as not everyones needs are the same. If youre wanting the best possible performance with ray tracing at 4K the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 will be the graphics card to buy. Should you desire better value with a card thats still capable of driving video to the same panel with decent results the AMD Radeon RX 9700 XTX is the better buy. AMD has undercut NVIDIA with its new flagship GPUs. The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX could still be considered overpriced but compared to NVIDIAs pricing structure this is far better bang for your buck. RDNA 3 is new and weve come to expect a rougher early adoption experience with AMD cards but theyre usually vastly improved as the generation matures. AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX AMDs RDNA 3 is here and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX is the new flagship GPU with enough performance for 4K and a more reasonable price. Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition NVIDIA is still king at gaming with ray tracing enabled. The GeForce RTX 4080 may be overpriced but its still a solid GPU.,2022-12-26T20:30:16Z
67,MSI might have the best 14-inch gaming laptop this year,"During CES 2023, MSI unveiled three new Stealth laptops, and it looks like it might be winning the 14-inch laptop game this year.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/msi-announces-new-stealth-laptops/,MSI has just unveiled a slew of new products at CES 2023 including some Stealth Studio laptops. These notebooks aimed chiefly at creative professionals and gamers come equipped with some of the latest hardware that could make them highly competitive. While there are three different variants the one that stands out the most is the 14inch Stealth 14 Studio which could be well on the way to being one of the best gaming laptops this year. Heres why we think this particular laptop might set MSI ahead of the curve. The three laptops on the way are the Stealth 17 Studio A13V Stealth 16 Studio A13V and Stealth 14 Studio A13V. The 14inch model sounds rather juicy MSI itself introduces it as the most powerful 14inch gaming laptop. To back up that claim it provides data that states it will be up to 33 more powerful than other 14inch laptops. Of course this kind of data is not very useful so well have to wait for some real benchmarks to truly compare the Stealth 14 Studio to The Stealth 14 Studio which is a CES 2023 Innovation Awards honoree features a slim build that houses a lot of goodies. Weve got a proper gaming keyboard with 83 keys an IR HD webcam with shutter and a larger touchpad. Despite the small size of the chassis MSI promises decent temperatures thanks to the use of vapor chamber cooling. It only gets more interesting from there. The 14inch notebook packs a topquality QHD screen with high refresh rates 240Hz an IPS panel and a 1610 aspect ratio. When it comes to the internals the laptop comes equipped with an Intel Core i713700H CPU alongside a choice between two GPUs the Nvidia RTX 4070 and the Nvidia RTX 4060. Were also getting a PCIe Gen 4. 0 SSD and up to 64GB of DDR5 RAM as well as Thunderbolt 4 connectivity. Lets move on to the Stealth 16 Studio. Available in UHD 3840 x 2160 and with a refresh rate of 120Hz the 16inch version adds a numpad for a total of 99 keys and bumps the IR camera up to Full HD. Theres also an Intel Core i913900H CPU but the GPU choice is limited to an Nvidia RTX 4070 8GB. The company doesnt go into much detail about the Stealth 17 Studio. This will presumably be a 17inch laptop with features that cater to gamers but well have to wait and see the specs at a later time. Gaming and creator laptops are famously heavy on battery life you often have to keep them plugged in to get anything done. To limit this issue MSI equipped them with Discrete Graphics Mode including a MUX switch on the motherboard. This should help you prioritize battery life or performance depending on what youre currently doing. MSI is yet to announce the pricing of these laptops but both the 14inch and the 16inch Stealth Studios sound pretty exciting. Depending on what else comes out this year the Stealth 14 Studio could turn out to be one of the most interesting gamingcreator Editors Recommendations The best VR and metaverse tech of CES 2023 3 reasons why you should buy a gaming laptop in 2023 We now know the eyewatering price of Nvidias RTX 4090 gaming laptops You can buy this LCD mod for one of the best PC cases now As a laptop reviewer this is the CES 2023 laptop Im most excited for,2023-01-04T17:00:13Z
68,"The ROG Flow X13 redesign makes it even thinner, even more powerful","Asus announces updates to its thin-and-light ROG Flow line of gaming laptops, including the Flow X13, Flow Z13, and Flow X16.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/asus-rog-flow-x13-redesign-more-power-ces-2023/,Asus has announced updates to its Flow family of ROG gaming laptops at CES 2023 including a full redesign of the Flow X13 improved graphics and screens across the board and an updated XG Mobile external graphics card. The Flow X13 the companys gaming laptop with a 360degree hinge is the biggest news though. The chassis has been shrunken down by 10mm from the original Flow X13 without having to shrink down the keyboard. Asus has even added extra battery capacity going from 62 watthours up to 75 watthours. Battery life should be improved further by including both a MUX switch and support for Nvidia Advanced Optimus which allows the device to automatically switch between taxing the discrete GPU and the integrated GPU. The Flow X13 also features a reimagined hinge that allows for better airflow and a new grippy texture on the lid. Up above the screen is now a 1080p webcam and an IR camera for Windows Hello facial authentication both new to the device in 2023. As expected the device will feature a nextgen Ryzen Zen 4 processor and RTX 40series graphics. The previous model maxed out an RTX 3050 Ti so Id expect similar configuration options for this one. Alongside the new Flow X13 Asus has also announced an update to last years Flow Z13 which is the 2in1 model that I was impressed by last year even naming it the most innovative laptop of 2022. The Surface Prolike design is still intact but the internals have been bumped to the latest from Intel and Nvidia 13thgen processors and RTX 40series graphics. More importantly the Flow Z13 now also gets a Nebula Display meaning the 13inch screen has a 1440p resolution and a 165Hz refresh rate. The larger model the Flow X16 has also received a sizable update especially with its display. It can now be configured with a Nebula HDR miniLED touchscreen which can hit up to 1100 nits of peak brightness. That should allow for some pretty incredible HDR gaming brighter even than the OLED panels featured in the Razer Blade 15 or MSI Raider GE67 HX. Asus calls it the best possible The Flow X16 also gets a bump to Intels latest Core i9 processors and RTX 40series GPUs. Lastly Asus completes its Flow lineup with an update to the XG Mobile the external graphics enclosure that can connect only to these three laptops via the proprietary port. This year its been updated to the Nvidia RTX 40series cards adding even more performance when connected to one of these laptops. Like previous models this still uses a laptop GPU which is what enables it to be so small. But if you have a firstgeneration Flow X13 being able to pick up a 40series XG Mobile should provide a significant uptick in gaming performance. All of the ROG Flow laptops and XG Mobile will be available sometime in the second quarter of this year.

69,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti preorders and where to find stock - live report,"The RTX 4070 Ti may be pricier than previous 70-class NVIDIA GPUs, but it's a beast for 1440p gaming and does a solid job handling 4K as well. We're covering its launch live right here, and are highlighting all of the retailers you can get one from.",https://www.windowscentral.com/news/live/where-buy-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070ti,Live NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti preorders and where to find stock live report The latest 40 series NVIDIA GPU is here. Heres where you can get your hands on one during its global launch. NVIDIAs GeForce RTX 4070 Ti graphics card is the latest GPU in Team Greens 40 series lineup offering PC gamers a more affordable alternative to the RTX 4090 and 4080 cards that launched in late 2022. Though the 4070 Ti began life as NVIDIAs cancelled RTX 4080 12GB variant it has been reborn into a GPU aimed at fans in need of an elite graphics card for 1440p gaming complete with a 100 price cut. Notably its also a solid choice for some 4K gaming as well especially if you opt to take advantage of Deep Learning Super Sampling DLSS 3 the cutting edge version of NVIDIAs upscaling technology thats exclusive to the 40 series. Now mere days after NVIDIAs surprise announcement of the RTX 4070 Ti at CES 2023 the graphics card is available to purchase and preorder around the globe. Thankfully though inventory hasnt depleted as quickly as it did for 30 series GPUs during The Great GPU Shortage of 2020 and 2021. This is because stock has proven to be fairly stable throughout the arrivals of other 40 series cards Intels Arc lineup and AMDs Radeon RX 7000 series. Notably the 4070 Ti didnt even sell out on launch day though many specific models have gone in and out of stock as gamers continue to flock to digital storefronts. Ultimately you should still act fast if you intend to buy as its still harder to get a new GPU than it was several years ago. To help you snag a 4070 Ti as quickly as possible weve provided links to where you can find listings for the card at major retailers below. On top of that weve also provided some important information about the GPU including its price power draw and more. Further down youll also find our live coverage of the launch and its aftermath which will feature links to specific SKUs availability updates news about the sale of prebuilt PCs equipped with an RTX 4070 Ti and more. Well be frequently updating our live blog with the latest information throughout the next several days so stay tuned Where can you buy an RTX 4070 Ti Like the RTX 4090 and 4080 before it the RTX 4070 Ti can be purchased from major online retailers that frequently sell PC components. In the US this includes sites such as Amazon Best Buy Newegg and BH. Meanwhile the card is available from Overclockers Scan Ebuyer and Newegg UK for folks in the UK. Below weve compiled a list of retailers for both regions. Make sure you keep a close eye on these sites both throughout and after the 4070 Ti launch as new listings for the graphics card will likely be added over time. Even if a retailer is fully sold out when you check it a new model of the card may become publicly available later. US NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Best BuyStock coming soon NeweggIn stock now BHStock available Amazon USIn stock now WalmartCheck stock UK NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti What time does the RTX 4070 Ti go on sale The RTX 4070 Ti became available around 6 a. m. PT 9 a. m. ET 2 p. m. GMT on January 5 2023. That means its available right now as youre reading this so keep an eye out for listings If you see a listing that says coming soon you should select it and refresh the page often. Theres a good chance youll be able to get the card right as it becomes available this way. What is the RTX 4070 Tis price and MSRP The RTX 4070 Ti is less expensive than both the RTX 4090 and the RTX 4080. While those graphics cards have eyewatering MSRPs of 1599 and 1199 respectively the 4070 Ti comes in at 799. As a result its much more affordable although its worth noting that its still a full 200 pricier than NVIDIAs 599 RTX 3070 Ti from the previous GPU generation. Its also important to note that while the price of the 4070 Ti is starting at 799 models of the GPU sold by NVIDIAs various manufacturing partners can and surely will be listed for a higher price. Typically graphics cards with higher prices have bonus features like RGB lighting customizable LED displays water blocks or some form of overclock. What power supply do you need for the RTX 4070 Ti Getting your hands on a brand new RTX 4070 Ti would be awesome but its important to make sure your system has a power supply with enough capacity to actually support it. Since the 4070 Ti is rated for a maximum power draw of 285W its best paired with a 750W PSU. A power supply of this caliber will give the graphics card the juice it needs for maximum performance while also providing enough power for other components like your CPU and RAM modules. If you need to upgrade your PCs PSU youll be happy to know that even the best power supply units arent terribly expensive. Youll have no problem finding a quality PSU that falls in the 100150 range provided youre not looking at power supplies with extremely high 1000W capacities. Should you buy an older graphics card instead of a 4070 Ti New graphics cards like the 4070 Ti are very expensive more than theyve ever been in the past in fact. This in addition to the fact that GPUs are also harder to find in stock than they used to be makes cards from previous generations attractive alternatives. While older GPUs like the RTX 3070 3070 Ti and 3080 wont offer the same elite 1440p and ultrawide gaming performance youd get with the 4070 Ti theyre fairly easy to track down and are much more affordable too. If youre on a budget or a tight timeframe and youre okay with sacrificing some performance taking advantage of the best graphics card deals for an older GPU is a fantastic idea. With that said we recommend sticking with the 4070 Ti if youre looking for an experience without compromise. Its the most powerful 70 class card that NVIDIA has ever released and its perfect for pushing high framerates at max settings with a 1440p or ultrawide display. Best Buy just dropped a range of pickuponly cards from various brands ranging from 840 to 1050 although the ASUS TUF Gaming and standard variant still display coming soon so grab the others at your nearby store while you can PNY RTX 4070 Ti 12GB 840 at Best Buyopens in new tab GIGABYTE RTX 4070 Ti Eagle OC 12GB 850 at Best Buyopens in new tab GIGABYTE RTX 4070 Ti Gaming OC 12GB 900 at Best Buyopens in new tab MSI RTX 4070Ti 12GB Gaming X Trio 12GB 900 at Best Buyopens in new tab MSI RTX 4070Ti 12GB VENTUS 3X OC 12GB 840 at Best Buyopens in new tab If youre trying to get a 4070 Ti at a price close to its MSRP act fast on these BH and Walmart listings for PNYs variants of the graphics card. Theyre only 800 and 830 respectively which is fully in line with NVIDIAs suggested price. The difference between the two GPUs is that the OC variant is overclocked which should give you a small amount of extra performance.

Unfortunately most available cards also have a ballooned price of 1200 which we dont recommend pulling the trigger on unless youre really really desperate and have tons of money to burn. However GIGABYTE does have a 900 variant of the 4070 Ti available on Newegg which is currently the closest to MSRP you can get if you dont want one of PNYs cards.

Put together by respected and reputable builders like CyberPowerPC and iBUYPOWER these systems pair the 4070 Ti with top notch components like 13th Gen Intel and AMD Ryzen 7000 series CPUs some of the best DDR5 RAM modules on the market and speedy high capacity SSDs. All of them also feature great cooling and many even include lots of snazzy RGB lighting. Prices for one of these PCs ranges from about 20002500 which isnt bad considering how insanely expensive many 4070 Ti cards are individually right now.

At 840 and 900 respectively theyre decently close to MSRP and because of that theyre a much better option than wildly overpriced alternatives. Its possible that additional cards at this price might release later especially since some listings across various retailers havent gone live yet. For now though these are some of the best options available. MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ti VENTUS 3X OC 840 at BH GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 4070 Ti GAMING OC 900 at Newegg Were pretty late into the 4070 Ti launch day now but even though many models of the card have sold out at this point several SKUs of it priced at or at least somewhat close to MSRP have gone back in stock and available to buy at US retailers. This is great news if youve been waiting patiently for a decent price though youll probably need to act fast since we dont expect inventory of these GPUs to last for long. Inventory at UK retailers meanwhile has so far remained very healthy throughout the 4070 Tis launch. The reasonably priced GPUs we highlighted earlier in the day are all still in stock allowing you to comfortably snag the card without having to worry about inflated costs or scalpers ripping you off.

Most if not all of the cards for sale we linked to earlier are still available so if you want a 4070 Ti for a price decently close to MSRP now is the time to nab one. In the following days its likely that well see some new SKUs hit the market alongside some additional options for prebuilt systems. On top of that models that have sold out could become available again as retailers work to replenish their stock. We still recommend pulling the trigger as soon as you can while both prices and availability are this stable though. In any event our live coverage of the 4070 Tis launch will continue as NVIDIAs new elite 1440p gaming GPU makes its way to retailers worldwide. Stay tuned for more spotlights on individual 4070 Tis prebuilt PCs and more.

70,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti vs. RTX 4080: Which Ada Lovelace GPU should you buy?,"If you absolutely must have the latest Nvidia 40 series graphics cards, you have two options with the 4070 Ti and the 4080.",https://www.xda-developers.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-vs-rtx-4080/,NVIDIA introduced the GeForce RTX 4080 as part of its 40 series launch and for 2023 the company outed the RTX 4070 Ti to sit just below the GPU and offer a more affordable entry point. In this guide well take a closer look at the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti vs. RTX 4080 to see which would be the best graphics card for you to buy. Source MSI NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti NVIDIAs GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is part of the RTX 40 series of cards based on Ada Lovelace. Its also the most affordable RTX 40 GPU to date which doesnt mean much with the current state of graphics card pricing. Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 is an overpriced GPU for whats on offer especially when compared to AMDs more affordable Radeon RX 7900 series of cards. NVIDIA has a few graphics cards out now for its 40 series including the most powerful GPU around in the form of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090. The RTX 4080 is positioned below it offering capable 4K performance at an inflated price of 1199. The RTX 4070 Ti was released with a price tag of 799 but can still tackle 4K gaming with some settings turned down. When shopping around for a new GPU value really should be of no concern as it doesnt really matter which new graphics card you end up buying youre likely getting a subpar deal. Even the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX could be viewed as overpriced. For better outright performance the RTX 4080 is the way to go. If youd rather not spend too much the RTX 4070 Ti is your card. RTX 4070 Ti vs. RTX 4080 Price and availability Its difficult to discuss GPU pricing without having a giggle. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 launched for 1199 which is a lot of money to pay for a graphics card that isnt even the flagship model. To put this into perspective its predecessor the RTX 3080 originally launched for 699. Sure NVIDIA made some serious improvements with the latest Ada Lovelace architecture but does it warrant an additional 500 The newer NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti launched with an MSRP of 799. Thats still more than what the previous gen RTX 3080 launched for. Now the RTX 4070 Ti is technically the better card over the RTX 3080 and so that may make some sense but the older RTX cards were substantial upgrades without such a steep price hike. Gamers are struggling to fund PC gaming and new card releases such as this dont help. Both the RTX 4080 and RTX 4070 Ti arent great deals at all which makes recommending either GPU difficult. Its also worth noting that NVIDIA will not be releasing its own Founders Edition of the RTX 4070 Ti meaning you can expect to pay more than 799 for AIB partner cards. Architecture The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is actually a relaunch of sorts. Originally announced as a 12GB RTX 4080 the card was met by much deserved criticism from just about everyone. The company is back with the RTX 4070 Ti and its based on the very same platform and architecture as its RTX 4080 sibling. With the RTX 4070 Ti NVIDIA cut down the RAM by 4GB and its on a slower 192bit bus compared to the 256bit bus with the RTX 4080. This is a substantial step down and adds to the performance deficit of the RTX 4070 Ti which is largely what caused all the fuss about it originally being listed as an RTX 4080. To go alongside the reduction in memory bandwidth are fewer CUDA cores fewer ray tracing cores and slower clock speeds. But the Ada Lovelace architecture is really efficient and you wont see the RTX 4070 Ti or RTX 4080 hit draws anywhere close to the ridiculous numbers of the RTX 4090. Performance We havent been able to get our paws on the RTX 4070 Ti to compare against the figures we have for the RTX 4080 but its easy to picture where the card should be standing thanks to the specifications. The 4070 Ti should sit comfortably behind the two AMD Radeon RX 7900 cards which is largely reflected in the price though the similarly priced RX 7900 XT wins here. There are also fewer ray tracing cores and so you can expect to see an even worse showing for the RTX 4070 Ti compared to the RTX 4080 when the feature is enabled in games. The table below has all our figures for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080. If were to assume the RTX 4070 Ti performs behind the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT wed subtract upwards of 20 from these numbers to reach an estimation for the 4070 Ti. Which GPU is best This is a difficult one to answer. Both GPUs dont offer great value. If you want the best performance go with the RTX 4080 if you absolutely must buy a 40series GPU from NVIDIA. If you want to save money and get a better deal the RTX 4070 Ti is the choice for you. If youd like my honest opinion... check previous generations for better value. Theres also AMDs Radeon RX 7900 XTX which may be overpriced but is a far better value proposition than both NVIDIA cards here. The GPU landscape looks set to continue offering terrible value for PC gamers in the coming months and holding out may not provide a golden opportunity to bag a GPU deal. NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti NVIDIAs GeForce RTX 4070 Ti is part of the RTX 40 series of cards based on Ada Lovelace. Its also the most affordable RTX 40 GPU to date which doesnt mean much with the current state of graphics card pricing. Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Founders Edition NVIDIAs Geforce RTX 4080 is an impressive 4K gaming GPU but its also incredibly expensive. Its the outright better card for performance if you can stomach the price tag.,2023-01-10T19:30:16Z
71,Acer launches new Nitro laptops with AMD Ryzen 7000 processors and GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs,"Acer is adding two more models to its Nitro gaming laptop lineup, powered by the latest AMD Ryzen processors and Nvidia graphics.",https://www.xda-developers.com/acer-nitro-swift-go-14-amd-ryzen-7000-ces-2023/,AMD has just unveiled the Ryzen 7000 series of laptop processors and because of that many new laptops are also being announced featuring the new goodies. Acer is jumping on board the Ryzen train with a few new devices of its own which are mostly AMDpowered variants of laptops announced earlier this week. Intel announced its new processors first so those announcements happened a bit earlier. The new AMDpowered Acer laptops include the Nitro 16 and Nitro 17 gaming laptops plus the Acer Swift Go 14 which is more geared toward mainstream audiences. Acer Nitro 16 and Nitro 17 For the gamers Acer is launching the new Acer Nitro 16 and Nitro 17 with AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors along with Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series GPUs. Both laptops are available with up to an AMD Ryzen 9 though the GPU configurations werent fully revealed. The Acer Nitro 16 is arguably the more unique of the two featuring a 16inch display with a 1610 aspect ratio which is slightly taller than a typical laptop display. It comes in either WUXGA 1920 x 1200 or WQXGA 2560 x 1600 resolution and a 165Hz refresh rate making it suitable for gaming as well as some productivity thanks to the taller screen. The screen also covers 100 of sRGB so its good enough for office work. The Acer Nitro 17 features a 17. 3inch display with a more traditional 169 aspect ratio and its available in Full HD versions with either a 144Hz or 165Hz refresh rate or a Quad HD model with at 165Hz. Both laptops feature a wide range of ports including support for USB4 HDMI 2. 1 and Intel Killer E2600G Ethernet. The Acer Nitro 16 and Nitro 17 with AMD Rzen 7000 will be available in May with prices starting at 1149. 99 1499 in Europe for the Nitro 16 and 1199. 99 1599 for the Nitro 17. Acer Swift Go 14 Another Acer laptop getting treated to AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors is the new Swift Go 14. Similar to the Intel model the Acer Swift Go 14 with AMD processors features a 14inch 2. 8K 2880 x 1800 OLED display with a 1610 aspect ratio which should provide a great viewing experience thanks to the 500 nits of brightness and 100 coverage of the DCIP3 color space. It also has a 90Hz refresh rate making motion and animations appear much smoother and making for a more pleasant experience overall. Acer touts a battery life of over 9. 5 hours on this machine and its using its TwinAir cooling system with dual fans and copper heat pipes helping keep things cool. The keyboard is also an air inlet so there should be plenty of cool air circulating into the chassis. Another highlight of the Acer Swift Go 14 is the webcam which supports 1440p resolution and temporal noise reduction for highquality video. It also supports Acers PurifiedView suite of features for a better video calling experience. The Acer Swift Go 14 with AMD Ryzen processors will be available in June in North America with a starting price of 849. 99. In Europe it will launch in April starting at 999.,2023-01-05T03:30:16Z

The post Google and Nvidia join the campaign against Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard deal a…",https://bgr.com/tech/google-and-nvidia-join-the-campaign-against-microsofts-activision-blizzard-deal/,Google and Nvidia are the latest companies to try and kneecap Microsofts acquisition of Activision Blizzard. As reported by Bloomberg the two companies have joined Sony in expressing concerns about Microsofts planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Microsoft which is currently being sued by the Federal Trade Commission in the United States to block the deal is fighting a mounting battle to make the acquisition happen. According to the report Google and Nvidia have provided information to the FTC that backs one of its key arguments that such an acquisition would be damaging to competition in the gaming industry. Google and Nvidia provided information that backs a key FTC contention that Microsoft could gain an unfair advantage in the market for cloud subscription and mobile gaming according to the people who asked not to be identified because the process is confidential. In its remarks to the FTC Nvidia stressed the need for equal and open access to game titles but didnt directly oppose the acquisition according to one of the people. Microsoft originally announced its plan to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022. The company is planning to pay a whopping 68. 7 billion to acquire the rights to a ton of huge titles like Call of Duty World of Warcraft Diablo Overwatch Starcraft and Candy Crush. Rumors of a suit from the FTC lingered for months and in December 2022 the FTC officially sued Microsoft to block the deal. While Sony claims that such an acquisition would stifle innovation and competition in the gaming industry it has mostly focused on how Microsoft could remove the Call of Duty franchise from the console which it obviously has a major stake in. Microsoft has pushed back saying that it plans to release Call of Duty on the PlayStation as long as the console exists. The company has also already promised to bring the franchise to Nintendo and Steam if the acquisition goes through of course.,2023-01-12T23:20:22Z
75,OBS Studio 29 launches with AV1 encoding for AMD and Intel Arc,OBS Studio version 29 is now available to all and the headline feature is support for AV1 encoding on AMD and Intel Arc GPUs.,https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/obs-studio-29-launches-with-av1-encoding-for-amd-and-intel-arc,OBS Studio 29 launches with AV1 encoding for AMD and Intel Arc The next big thing in encoders is now available for all three GPU makers. What you need to know The OBS Studio version 29 update has now hit the stable channel and is available to all. The headline new feature is AV1 encoding support for both supported AMD Radeon and Intel Arc GPUs. NVIDIA 40 series cards already had access to AV1 but now all three GPU makers are included. Content creators that use OBS Studio have a little treat in store as version 29 is now generally available. The opensource broadcasting software has many new features included as always but the headline feature is one that will be of significance to owners of Intel Arc GPUs and AMDs latest Radeon releases. Version 28 had support for hardware AV1 encoding utilizing the new NVIDIA 40 series graphics cards version 29 brings that to both AMD and Intel users as well. Intel actually beat NVIDIA to the market with hardware AV1 encoding with the release of the Arc A380 and then the subsequent launch of the A750 and A770. OBS support however was initially not available. OBS Studio 29 is now outThis release brings additional encoders including AV1 on the AMD RX7000 series and AV1HEVC for supported Intel GPUs on Windows and HEVC and ProRes support on macOS as well as fixes for bugs and crashes. Full changelog httpst. cotomxlPgOvnJanuary 9 2023 Here are the highlights from the changelog as it relates to Windows users of OBS Added support for the AMD AV1 Encoder for the RX7000 series GPUs on Windows Added support for the Intel AV1 Encoder for Arc GPUs on Windows Note CQP is available but not fully supported Added support for the Intel HEVC Encoder on Windows Added an upward compressor filter Added a 3band equalizer filter Added update channels for opting into receiving betareleasecandidate builds to Windows There are a number of tweaks and improvements added too and you can peruse the full changelog on the OBS GitHub repo. Windows Centrals take Ready for AV1 streaming when you are Twitch and YouTube AV1 is a big deal though right now its not entirely useful. Content creators can use it and upload their content to YouTube but right now live streaming isnt supported. You would imagine its only a matter of time but that time frame isnt yet something we know. We do know that Twitch plans to support AV1 and since YouTube already does you would imagine its a given that live broadcasting will be included at some point. The fact that all three GPU makers now offer hardware encoders for AV1 may also help to speed up the process. AV1 is a more efficient way of encoding video so its also in the platforms best interests to get on board. In simple terms AV1 allows for video encoding at comparable quality to existing encoders but with smaller file sizes. And for streaming this could well become a game changer. Sure you need an Arc Radeon 7000 series or NVIDIA 40 series to make use of it but of the three Intel is definitely the best bet. For example the Arc A380 is around 150 and also has the hardware AV1 encoder. Its a lowcost fairly lowpower graphics card and its conceivable you could add one of these to your streaming rig as a dedicated encoding card versus splashing a lot of cash on a new AMD or NVIDIA card.

76,Nvidia revives canceled RTX 4080 as 'new' 12GB RTX 4070 TI,"Hopefully it comes with a 'new' competitive price, too
Nvidia this week quietly, and perhaps unintentionally, revealed the previously canceled RTX 4080 12GB would be reborn as the RTX 4070 TI.…",https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/30/nvidia_rtx_4080_graphics/,Nvidia revives canceled RTX 4080 as new 12GB RTX 4070 TI Hopefully it comes with a new competitive price too Nvidia this week quietly and perhaps unintentionally revealed the previously canceled RTX 4080 12GB would be reborn as the RTX 4070 TI. The GPUgiant pulled the card shortly after its launch at GTC this fall after facing backlash for launching two RTX 4080s based on entirely different GPU dies and sporting a hefty 300 price difference. The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card but its not named right. Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing. So were pressing the unlaunch button a news release from October read. Many had speculated the card would reappear reborn as the 4070. And this week Nvidia confirmed those suspicions after the RTX 4070 TI appeared on the companys 40series product page. A glance over the specs reveals no real surprises here. The card boasts 7680 CUDA cores a 2. 52GHz boost clock and 12GB of GDDR6X memory. You may recall those are the same specs promised by Nvidias lowerspec RTX 4080. The new GPU world order is beginning to take shape Nvidia admits mistake unlaunches 12GB RTX 4080 AMDs latest greatest Radeon graphics card 600 cheaper than Nvidias top RTX 4090 Nvidia unveils RTX 4090 but its the 4080 to watch out for The new 40series cards full spec sheet hasnt been published yet but its safe to say itll use Nvidias AD104 GPU die have a 192bit memory bus and a 285W TDP. It appears the cards details may have been published early by mistake but as of Friday morning Nvidia had not removed them for their site. What we dont know is what the card will retail for. At launch the 12GB 4080 had an MSRP of 899. However in the months since GTC the PC market has changed considerably. GPU demand has plummeted in the wake of the cryptocrash Ethereum merge and other inflationary pressures. With the launch of AMDs RDNA3 GPUs last month Nvidia is facing stiff competition particularly when it comes to pricing. Team Reds flagship card the 999 RX 7900 XTX undercuts Nvidias RTX 4090 by nearly 600. The more pedestrian RX 7900 XT meanwhile retails for 899. As it stands Nvidias cheapest 40series card the 16GB RTX 4080 has a suggested retail price of 1199. And while it appears you can actually find cards at that price at least in the US weve also seen boardpartner cards selling for more than 1700. Given how poorly Nvidia and the broader PC market have performed in recent quarters it wouldnt be surprising to see the RTX 4070 TI introduced at a lower price this time around. This week the industry watchers at Wccftech citing multiple unnamed sources claimed the card would instead launch at 799. Its also not clear when the card to hit will be available. Nvidias website claims rather unhelpfully that the card is coming Month XX. But given the timing of the cards appearance on Nvidias site a CES launch early next month seems a likely bet.,2022-12-30T20:25:54Z

78,"Microsoft acquires Fungible, a maker of data processing units, to bolster Azure - Yahoo Movies Canada","In December, reports suggested that Microsoft had acquired Fungible, a startup fabricating a type of data center hardware known as a data processing unit...",https://ca.movies.yahoo.com/microsoft-acquires-fungible-maker-data-185737148.html,Microsoft acquires Fungible a maker of data processing units to bolster Azure In December reports suggested that Microsoft had acquired Fungible a startup fabricating a type of data center hardware known as a data processing unit DPU for around 190 million. Today Microsoft confirmed the acquisition but not the purchase price saying that it plans to use Fungibles tech and team to deliver multiple DPU solutions network innovation and hardware systems advancements. Fungibles technologies help enable highperformance scalable disaggregated scaledout data center infrastructure with reliability and security Girish Bablani the CVP of Microsofts Azure Core division wrote in a blog post. Todays announcement further signals Microsofts commitment to longterm differentiated investments in our data center infrastructure which enhances our broad range of technologies and offerings including offloading improving latency increasing data center server density optimizing energy efficiency and reducing costs. A DPU is a dedicated piece of hardware designed to handle certain data processing tasks including security and network routing for data traffic. The approach is intended to help reduce the load on CPUs and GPUs for core computing tasks related to a given workload. Fungible was launched in 2016 by Bertrand Serlet a former Apple software engineer who sold a cloud storage startup Upthere to Western Digital in 2017 alongside Krishna Yarlagadda and Juniper Networks cofounder Pradeep Sindhu. Fungible sold DPUs that relied on two operating systems one open source and the other proprietary and a microprocessor architecture called MIPS to control flash storage volumes. Fungible managed to raise over 300 million in venture capital prior to the Microsoft acquisition from investors including SoftBanks Vision Fund and Norwest Venture Partners. But its DPU architecture was difficult to develop for reportedly which mightve affected its momentum. In August after a rumored failed sale to Meta the company revealed that it had laid off staff and was scaling back its product portfolio. Increasing competition in the market for DPUs put pressure on Fungible as well. Nvidia acquired DPU maker BlueField in 2019 while AMD snatched up Pensando late last year. Other rivals included GigaIO Liqid Lightbits VMwares Project Monterey and Amazon Web Services Nitro cards which provide DPUlike functionality. In Fungible Microsoft gets DPU tech it could use to bolster Azure perhaps by selling it as a subscription product or tiered service for block storage. Its the second data centercentric acquisition in recent months for the tech giant interestingly following the purchase of highspeed fiber startup Lumenisity in December. The Fungible DPU was invented in 2016 to address the most significant problems in scaleout data centers the inefficient execution of datacentric computations within server nodes Fungible wrote in a statement on its website. We are proud to be part of a company that shares Fungibles vision and will leverage the Fungible DPU and software to enhance its storage and networking offerings. The Fungible team will join Microsofts data center infrastructure engineering teams Bablani said.,2023-01-09T18:57:37Z

81,Colorful GeForce RTX 4080 NB EX-V review: 4K gaming extraordinaire,"Colorful's GeForce RTX 4080 has an elegant design and offers huge gains over the RTX 30 series, outshining even the mighty RTX 3090 Ti.",https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/colorful-geforce-rtx-4080-review,Windows Central Verdict Thanks to an energyefficient node and architectural changes the GeForce RTX 4080 delivers huge gains in all key areas over the RTX 3080. This is the secondfastest video card available today and while youre paying a hefty premium you are getting a lot of power the card offers better performance than the 2000 RTX 3090 Ti. If you intend to play at 4K this is the card to get. Pros Amazing at 4K gaming DLSS 3 is groundbreaking 16GB of video memory Noticeably faster than 3090 Ti Understated design without overt RGB lighting Cons Costly Power connector is finicky Threeslot design Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. The GeForce RTX 30 series was characterized be extremes. An overwhelming demand for these video cards at launch coincided with a pandemicdriven manufacturing shortage and it was extremely difficult to get a hold of any of these cards I had to wait over eight months to get my RTX 3080. But even as NVIDIA and its AIB partners started to get manufacturing under control in 2022 demand for the best mining GPUs declined as the industry crashed leading to a glut of inventory. Its in this setting that the RTX 40 series makes its debut. NVIDIA is taking things to a new level with the Ada Lovelace architecture and the RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 deliver huge gains over their RTX 30 series predecessors. The RTX 4080 in particular is in an interesting position this year the card was originally meant to launch in two variants a standard 16GB model and a lowercost 12GB variant with fewer cores and user backlash against the 12GB model led NVIDIA to spin off that card into its own SKU. That leaves us with the 16GB version of the RTX 4080. NVIDIA has a lot to offer with this generation other than new cores the overhauled architecture aims to deliver much better efficiency figures and the introduction of DLSS 3 is a huge differentiator for the brand. For this review Im using Colorfuls base variant of the RTX 3080 the Colorful GeForce RTX 4080 16GB NB EXV. This card is in line with NVIDIAs RTX 4080 Founders Edition offering the same 9729 cores with a 16GB GDDR6X interface over a 256bit memory bus and a base frequency of 2205Mhz. The RTX 4080 starts off at a lofty 1199 500 more than the RTX 3080 when it debuted two years ago. Both launches in the RTX 40 series thus far have been listed at a premium with the RTX 4090 starting off at a ridiculous 1599. So lets take a look at what youre getting with the RTX 4080 and whether it makes sense to get the card over the RTX 3080. Colorful GeForce RTX 4080 Pricing and availability NVIDIA unveiled the RTX 4080 series on November 15 2022 with sales kicking off the same week. Like previous generations NVIDIA sells its Founders Edition on its own and there are several AIB partners that offer their own version of the RTX 4080 with the notable omission of EVGA. The Founders Edition of the RTX 4080 retails for 1199 and youll find AIB cards that start off at the same 1199 figure and go all the way up to 1550. The Colorful variant Im using costs 1249. Thankfully availability isnt an issue here and as of January 2023 the RTX 4080 is available direct from NVIDIA as well as major retailers. The card is selling at its list price unlike the RTX 4090 which is sold out at most retailers or going for upwards of 2000. Colorful GeForce RTX 4080 Hardware overview NVIDIA made a lot of tweaks with this generation not least among which is how the GPUs are manufactured. Unlike previous years NVIDIA isnt reusing the same silicon with fewer cores the RTX 4080 features its own AD103 silicon that has a smaller surface area than the AD102 thats used for the RTX 4090 and this allows for savings in manufacturing costs. That said youll find a wider gulf than usual between the RTX 4090 and 4080 with the latter offering 9728 cores 40 less than the 4090 and 16GB of memory over a narrower 256bit wide interface versus 14GB at 384bit for the 4090. Similar to its predecessor the 4080 gets a TDP of 320W. NVIDIA went with a new 124 pin 12VHPWR connector that delivers up to 450W of power and youll find a connector in the box that lets you plug in three PCIe 8pin cables to the card. Not much has altered when it comes to the ports with the RTX 4080 offering three DisplayPort 1. 4a ports along with one HDMI 2. 1a. The RTX 30 series introduced hardwarelevel AV1 decode and thats available here as well. Heres a highlevel overview of what youre getting with the RTX 4080 and how it fares against the RTX 4090 and the RTX 3080 Colorful GeForce RTX 4080 Architecture The RTX 4080 sees the introduction of the Ada Lovelace cores and a new Optical Flow Accelerator along with new RT cores. NVIDIA has shifted from Samsungs 8nm to TSMCs 4nm node for this generation leading to much better efficiency figures after all the best Android phones are made on the same node. The GPU has a PCIE 4. 0 x16 host interface and features 16GB of GDDR6X memory over a 256bit interface leading to bandwidth of 716GBs. The AD103 silicon has seven raster engines and each of these has six Texture Processing Clusters. The TPC houses two Streaming Multiprocessors and a Polymorph unit. These SMs contain 128 CUDA cores each and like the RTX 30 series theyre divided into two clusters half of the cores are solely for FP32 while the other half is for FP32 or INT32 with a distinct data path available for both clusters. With six TPCs in an engine we get 1536 cores for each unit and the AD103 silicon has a total of 10752 cores. But NVIDIA lobbed off four TPCs for the RTX 4080 so we get 9728 cores instead. NVIDIA overhauled the RT cores and the thirdgen cores are able to deliver better shading performance while utilizing fewer resources. Possibly the biggest change with this generation is the introduction of DLSS 3. It now comes with a new Frame Generation mode that leverages AI to automatically create every alternate frame and this is achieved with the new Optical Flow Accelerator and fourthgen Tensor units. How it works is that the Optical Flow Accelerator predicts what the next frame in a scene will be and it uses Optical Multiframe Generation to inject an intermediate frame in between so you basically get higher framerates without any decline in quality. As the Optical Flow Accelerator is a key part of the feature Frame Generation is limited to RTX 40 series cards. Colorful GeForce RTX 4080 Design Having used NVIDIAs Founders Edition cards for the last two generations in my gaming machine and then switching to the RGB lighting extravaganza that is the EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 FTW3 I was interested in seeing what Colorful is doing in this category. The GeForce RTX 4080 16GB NB EXV has a dark grey color scheme that looks quite good and the red accents with the jagged edges add a bit of flair to the design. I also got Zotacs GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 alongside the Colorful RTX 4080 and they have a much more aggressive style. Colorful did a good job delivering a clean aesthetic here and if you dont want a card with too much RGB lighting this is a great alternative. That said the RTX 4080 is inherently larger and heavier than its predecessor and the threeslot design means it will take up a lot of room in your gaming rig. It is also quite heavy at 3. 7 lb 1. 7kg and thats in no small part down to the backplate. Like NVIDIAs own cards Colorful went with a vented design here to allow air to flow via the backplate and that makes a difference. The 124 pin 12VHPWR connector is located at the top and I thankfully didnt see any issues in this area. I was initially worried when plugging in the three PCIe 8pin cables to the connector but after using the card for a month things have been rocksolid. Colorful GeForce RTX 4080 Efficiency and performance The RTX 4080 is aimed at gamers looking to get the best possible framerates and is frankly overkill if you dont have a 4K monitor youre better served by the RTX 3080 or even the RTX 3070 if youre using a QHD or FHD monitor. It still makes sense to get the RTX 4080 if you have a QHD monitor with 144Hz or higher refresh rates as it will deliver better framerates than the RTX 3080 but you will be paying a huge premium. Thanks to the switch to 4nm there are huge gains on the efficiency side of things and the RTX 4080 consumes less power for the same workloads as its predecessor. It consumes less than 20W when idling going up to 25W for video playback. While gaming it hits just over 300W a full 40W less than the Founders Edition RTX 3080. It can go up to 370W under full load and from an efficiency point of view it demolishes the RTX 3080. At 4K resolution and the settings maxed out in each game the RTX 4080 delivers huge gains across the board against the RTX 3080. Whats particularly interesting is that the card is consistently faster than the best of the RTX 30 series the 2000 3090 Ti. Theres a noticeable 10 to 15 uptick against the mighty RTX 3090 Ti in most games and whats incredible is that youll see a performance delta of an insane 45 between the RTX 3080 and 4080 in 4K titles. The RTX 4080 is second only to the RTX 4090 in this regard and if youve invested in a 4K monitor and want to make the most of it the RTX 4080 is the way to go here. Youll find a similar story at QHD resolution and the RTX 4080 has a comfortable lead over the RTX 3080 and even the 3090 Ti bested only by the 4090. The card is a great choice if you have a QHD monitor with a high refresh rate but if you want to maximize value Id still suggest getting the RTX 3080 for this resolution. As with the last two generations enabling ray tracing leads to a huge hit in framerates but thanks to the new cores and architecture the RTX 4080 fares significantly better than its predecessors particularly at 4K. The RTX 4080 has a huge advantage over the RTX 3080 at QHD as well and youll see nearly double the scores for most titles. There arent many titles out with DLSS 3 at this moment but in games like The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt the card was able to deliver over 80fps with the new Frame Generation feature an increase of 35. Overall DLSS 3 is a groundbreaking new addition that turbocharges ray tracing and NVIDIA has managed to carve out a significant lead over AMD in this area. Colorful GeForce RTX 4080 The alternatives The biggest issue with the RTX 4080 is just how much it costs and if youre not willing to shell out that much money youre in luck. NVIDIA and its AIB partners have a lot of unsold inventory of the RTX 30 series and you can get the RTX 3080 or 3080 Ti at a decent discount. While the RTX 30 series doesnt quite hold up against the RTX 4080 when it comes to 4K you are getting a much better value. AMDs Radeon RX 7900 XT is also an enticing choice if youre interested in 4K gaming. It retails for a few hundred dollars less than the RTX 4080 and while it doesnt quite deliver the same smooth framerates it gets quite close. Colorful GeForce RTX 4080 Should you buy it You should buy this if Youre looking for the ultimate video card for 4K gaming You need a card that excels at ray tracing You need good energy efficiency You want a card thats faster than the RTX 3090 Ti You shouldnt buy this if You want a video card thats affordable You need a video card that isnt too big With the RTX 4080 NVIDIA is delivering huge gains in all key areas against the RTX 3080. The Ada Lovelace architecture and the shift to a new 4nm node lead to much better efficiency and the card is nearly twice as fast as the RTX 3080 at 4K resolution you finally get 60fps in most titles without breaking a sweat. However all of those gains come at a cost. The RTX 4080 starts off at a hefty 1199 and while you are getting good value here it is demonstrably faster than the 2000 RTX 3090 Ti at 4K that is a lot of money to pay for a video card particularly given that discounted RTX 30 cards are still available. At the end of the day you will have to decide if you want to invest that kind of money toward a video card. For what its worth the RTX 4080 is the ideal choice if youre using a 4K monitor or QHD monitor with a high refresh rate and NVIDIA is doing all the right things with DLSS 3. That feature has plenty of potential and Im interested in seeing how game makers leverage it in the future. For now though the RTX 4080 is the best option if you want effortless 4K gaming. If you dont want to shell out that kind of money the RTX 30 series is still a reliable option as is AMDs recent Radeon RX 7900 XT theres no shortage of choice at the moment. Colorful did a great job with the GeForce RTX 4080 NB EXV. The card has an elegant design that looks great and it is on par with other AIB cards that arent factory overclocked. If youre in a country where it is available this is a great alternative to the Founders Edition RTX 4080.

82,"ASUS details its 2023 Strix line-up with the latest and greatest from Intel, NVIDIA, and AMD","ASUS has used CES 2023 to reveal its new ROG Strix lineup of gaming laptops, with the latest CPUs and GPUs joining improved and enlarged displays.",https://www.windowscentral.com/asus-rog-strix-2023-lineup,ASUS details its 2023 Strix lineup with the latest and greatest from Intel NVIDIA and AMD ASUS has a ton of impressive upgrades for its 2023 gaming laptops. What you need to know ASUS has revealed its first 2023 ROG Strix laptops at CES with some big promises. Latest hardware from Intel NVIDIA and AMD all in play. Strix Scar 18 headlines the lineup with insane power and size but not weight. ASUS has held the first of its CES 2023 launch events and first on the slate are its latest and greatest gaming laptops. And theres a lot of them. Rather than detail every single laptop though Im going to break down some of the key details that ROG buyers will find on their 2023 machines as well as some of the most impressive new models including the goliath that is the Strix Scar 18. On one hand theres some similarity because ASUS was forwardthinking enough to have its laptop designs prepared in prior years for increases in display size. So while the outsides may look familiar theres plenty of good stuff underneath. Intel 13th Gen NVIDIA 40 Series and AMD Ryzen 7000 inside ASUS as expected is packing the latest from all the major players into its new ROG gaming laptops. From Intel that means 13th Gen CPUs all the way up to the Core i913980HX from NVIDIA the RTX 4090 and from AMD up to the Ryzen 9 7945HX. Naturally the highestend internals are reserved for the flagship models with the highest prices but ASUS ROG laptops for 2023 will be packing the best of the best if you want it. At the highest end that now means a 24core CPU is on offer alongside a 175W GPU providing insane performance for gaming. High quality and larger displays no increase to size It looks like 2023 is going to herald the arrival of the 18inch laptop like the colossal Strix Scar 18. In truth despite having the largest display of any of ASUS recent gaming laptops its overall size hasnt increased compared to the older 17inch version. ASUS was prepared for the increase so the chassis was already there to accommodate it. What it does mean is slimmer bezels all around and we get a 1610 aspect ratio to boot. The same applies where the display sizes have been bumped to 16 inches as well. Besides increases in size ASUS is going big on the quality of its displays for its 2023 gaming laptops. All Strix machines are equipped with a Nebula display. The standards for these panels are at most a 3ms response time at least 500 nits brightness and all cover 100 of the DCIP3 color gamut. In years past some of ASUS laptop displays were definitely lacking in color accuracy so a commitment here is most welcome. Whether for gaming or for creative work. Additionally display options on the Strix lineup go up to 240 Hz refresh rate at QHD. The Strix Scar 16 however will have the option for a Nebula HDR display. Based on Mini LED this will have a peak brightness of up to 1100 nits. Improved cooling systems with three fans First seen on the 2022 Flow X16 ASUS is bringing its TriFan cooling system to its 16 and 18inch Strix gaming laptops. This is exactly as it sounds with three internal fans compared to the two found on most gaming laptops. It isnt just about an extra fan though. These are paired with a fullwidth heatsink again first seen on the Flow X16. But its now bigger and using a new liquid metal compound from Thermal Grizzly on selected models. Full surround vents allow for maximum airflow and when all is combined it allows ASUS to push the TGP of the CPU and GPU further than ever. Available through Q1 and Q2 2023 The various ROG Strix laptops will become available throughout the first two quarters of the year. Most versions of Strix and Strix Scar will hit the shelves in Q2 while the rangetopping Strix Scar 18 complete with Intel Core i9 and RTX 4090 will become available in Q1.

What you need to know MSI is a huge manufacturer of laptops desktops PC components accessories and more. During CES 2023 the company revealed a huge lineup of new gaming products. The announcements included four gaming laptops a gaming desktop four monitors and much more. The company also announced its lineup of GeForce 40Series GPUs a new motherboard and other components and accessories. CES 2023 is the place to be for the latest developments in the world of PC gaming and MSI is one of the biggest players in the space. During the tech conference MSI revealed a veritable avalanche of new products ranging from highend gaming laptops to individual PC components and accessories. Theres a lot here so well jump right into it. Many exact details are light on the moment for these products unfortunately but heres everything you need to know about MSIs announcements during CES 2023. MSI Stealth Studio gaming laptops MSIs Stealth line of gaming laptops are meant to deliver impeccable creative and gaming performance in a thin and light package. During CES 2023 MSI revealed two new laptops with the Stealth 14 Studio and the Stealth 16 Studio. As you can imagine these laptops are similar in many ways but with the former possessing a 14inch 240Hz 1610 QHD IPS display and the latter possessing a 16inch display with the same resolutions and specs. Both laptops are powered by the latest 13th Gen Intel Core processor and up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 GPU. MSI also packed these laptops with RGBbacklit keyboards from SteelSeries quadspeaker audio setups and Thunderbolt 4 support. The 16inch model boasts a 99Whr battery the largest it can legally be which will hopefully lend it halfway decent battery life for a gaming laptop. The duo certainly looks sleek but it remains to be seen if they or any of MSIs latest gaming laptops have what it takes to compete with the best gaming laptops on the market. MSI Raider GE78 HX gaming laptop The MSI Raider GE78 HX is equipped with some of the most powerful and capable hardware you can currently find in a gaming laptop. With up to a 13th Gen Intel Core i913980HX and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 the Raider GE78 looks like a truly ridiculous powerhouse of a laptop.

85,ASUS is bringing the first glasses-free 3D OLED display to two of its 2023 laptops and it's amazing,3D might actually be good this time.,https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/asus-is-bringing-the-first-glasses-free-3d-oled-display-to-two-of-its-2023-laptops-and-its-amazing,ASUS is bringing the first glassesfree 3D OLED display to two of its 2023 laptops and its amazing 3D might actually be good this time. What you need to know ASUS has debuted its new ProArt StudioBook 16 and VivoBook Pro 16X laptops both with glassesfree 3D OLED displays. Eye tracking allows the image to shift to always remain in clear focus. Both are backed by the latest CPUs and GPUs from NVIDIA. Thought 3D was dead Think again. ASUS has debuted its most impressive new tech of CES 2023 in the form of the first glassesfree 3D panel found on a laptop. Well two laptops. The allnew ProArt StudioBook 16 and VivoBook Pro 16X have the new displays onboard something ASUS is calling Spatial Vision. This isnt just another attempt at pushing 3D though there are real world benefits to the tech and this time it might actually be worth paying attention to. The only real bad news so far is that neither of these laptops are slated to launch until Q3 so right now it really is just an early tease. But having tried it out in December firsthand I think this is definitely one of the most impressive reveals of this years CES. Eye tracking technology and no glasses required 3D has never been something Ive really gone for. I dont want to sit wearing a pair of glasses for hours on end to watch a movie and glassesfree panels have hardly been impressive to date. How many people turned it off on the Nintendo 3DS because it was terrible and made your eyes hurt There are two parts to ASUS Spatial Vision which change all that. The first is that this is a highquality OLED display. It has a 3. 2K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. So even if youre just using it in regular old 2D mode its really good. The other is the eye tracking technology. Paired with a lenticular lens the display is capable of producing a defined image for each eye creating an autostereoscopic 3D image. Because it tracks your eyes as they shift around the image responds. So theres no requirement to stay looking exactly straight at the display like youre having a staring contest with it. The play here isnt just delivering content either. The idea is to provide a better experience for creators working with 3D models and content. One of the demos I experienced was a simple showcase of some 3D models and its hard to put into words how impressive they looked. The level of detail visible is remarkable. It takes a second or two for your eyes to adjust but otherwise it just feels well normal. ASUS also had a special version of the Avatar The Way of Water trailer made for this display. Again surprisingly good for not wearing 3D glasses so I could definitely see a future where creating and viewing this type of content is possible on a laptop like this. The ProArt StudioBook 16 and VivoBook Pro 16X The 3D display is the star of the show but what about the laptops built around it. Since the target is content creation and 3D modelling both laptops pack plenty of performance. The ProArt StudioBook 16 will contain an Intel Core i913980HK CPU backed by up to 64GB of upgradeable memory and NVIDIA RTX 40 Series graphics. For additional creative chops it also has a haptic trackpad that supports stylus input and a rotary dial. Ports include Thunderbolt 4 and there will also be a regular 2D OLED touchscreen version as well as one containing a professional NVIDIA RTX GPU. The VivoBook Pro 16X also uses an Intel Core i913980HK CPU and NVIDIA RTX 40 series graphics. It can be configured with up to 64GB of DDR5 SODIMM memory and a pair of 2TB PCIe 4. 0 SSDs. It supports the NVIDIA Studio drivers for creative workloads and with an upgraded cooling system allows the full 150W TGP to be unleashed for maximum performance. Theres no word on pricing at this point but with ASUS traditional home event at Computex in the summer happening before the slated Q3 launch wed expect to hear more about it then.

86,Speaker diarization (labels) for OpenAI Whisper generated transcripts,"It has been a few months since OpenAI released its state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model to the public, and the excitement surrounding it has not yet subsided. In my testing, the model's transcription quality, as measured by Word Error Rat…",https://www.ufarooqi.com/speaker-diarization-for-whisper-transcripts/,Speaker Diarization for WhisperGenerated Transcripts It has been a few months since OpenAI released its stateoftheart Automatic Speech Recognition ASR model to the public and the excitement surrounding it has not yet subsided. In my testing the models transcription quality as measured by Word Error Rate WER is on par with other opensource ASR models particularly those developed by Nvidia. It also appears to outperform its peers when it comes to transcribing long audio files. The only issue I have noticed is that the model may sometimes produce hallucinations in the transcription particularly for longer audio files. Unfortunately Whisper does not provide the ability to identify the speaker for its transcriptions. They may add that ability in the future. Until then we will try to come up with a solution that works well in most cases. Along with text transcripts Whisper also outputs the timestamps for utterances which may not be accurate and can have a leadlag of a few seconds. For accurate speaker diarization we need to have correct timestamps for each word. Some clever folks have successfully tried to fix this with WhisperX and stablets. These libraries try to forcealign the transcription with the audio file using phonemebased ASR models like wav2vec2. 0. If Whisper outputs hallucinations these libraries may not function properly or could potentially break. Once we get timestamps for each word we need to find the mapping between timestamps and speaker labels. We can achieve this by using a diarization framework. A typical diarization pipeline involves the following steps Voice Activity Detection VAD using a pretrained model. Segmentation of audio file with a window size of 0. 53s. Speaker embedding extraction of these segments using a pretrained model. Clustering Spectral KMeans or any other the speaker embeddings to correctly label each segment with a speaker label. Nearly all unsupervised Diarization frameworks follow the same approach. I have seen a lot of previous attempts to diarize whisper transcriptions using pyannote. The best one I saw so far involved getting timestamps for each speaker label using pyannote and using these timestamps to segment the audio file and feed each segmented audio file to Whisper. This approach works fine but it can be pretty slow especially if there are many short utterances in a long audio file. I tried to use pyannote for my attempt at diarization but it didnt give good results compared to Nvidia Nemo. It may be because of the way Nemo performs segmentation. For correct diarization results we would prefer the windowlength to be as fine as possible so that we can diarize utterances like yeah hmm and oh etc. But a fine windowlength will also make it hard to identify the speaker as our sample size is also small. Similarly a coarse windowlength will give you enough sample to correctly identify the speaker but you cant label precise utterances. Nemo solves it by using multiscale segmentation i. e. we segment the audio file with different window lengths e. g. 1. 5s 1. 0s 0. 5s. During the embedding extraction of the smallest windowlength i. e. 0. 5s for our example we also calculate embeddings for other scales 1. 5s and 1. 0s which are closer to the smallest segment and take a weighted average of these embeddings before feeding them to the clustering algorithm. Once we diarize the input audio file using Nemos Clustering Diarizer we get the mapping between timestamps and speaker labels. We can combine this mapping with whisperXs generated word timestamps mapping to get word speaker label mapping. We can then use word speaker label mapping to get a fully diarized transcript i. e. Speaker Label SentencesUtterances. Our diarized transcript would still have some errors during speaker changes. You may see something like this Speaker A Its got to come from somewhere else. Yeah that ones also fun because you know the lows are Speaker B going to suck right So its actually it hits you on both sides....... We can see that the sentence Yeah that ones... suck right is part of both Speaker A and Speaker Bs utterances. This could happen due to frequent overlapped speech background noise or faulty timestamps either from ASR or the diarization model. There are a couple of ways to correct this alignment error Realignment using NGramMasked Language Models One simple way is to use an ngram Language Model KenLM or a masked Language Model to calculate sentence perplexity log probability. To do that well get the last few words of Speaker As utterance and the first few words of Speaker Bs utterances add n at different places and calculate the sentence perplexity. The optimal position of n would be where the probability is maximum. Something like this Speaker A That was an amazon Speaker B podcast. Oh yeah I really enjoyed it. perplexityscore 1 Speaker A That was an amazon podcast. Speaker B Oh yeah I really enjoyed it. perplexityscore 5 Speaker A That was an amazon podcast. Oh Speaker B yeah I really enjoyed it. perplexityscore 3 Speaker A That was an amazon podcast. Oh yeah. Speaker B I really enjoyed it. perplexityscore 4 Speaker A That was an amazon podcast. Oh yeah. I Speaker B really enjoyed it. perplexityscore 1..... I tried this approach on multiple examples. The results were promising but not consistent. Realignment using Punctuations Another simple method you can call it a hack is to use punctuation markings. If a sentence is split between two different speakers it can either be part of Speaker As utterance or Speaker Bs utterance. We can simply take the mode of speaker labels for each word in the sentence and use that speaker label for the whole sentence. Something like this Speaker A Its got to come from somewhere else. Yeah that ones also fun because you know the lows are Speaker B going to suck right So its actually it hits you on both sides. The sentence Yeah that ones also... right is mostly spoken by Speaker A so it should be considered part of Speaker As utterance. The situation becomes more complex when one speaker is giving a monologue while other speakers are making occasional comments like Hmm yeah and exactly in the background. The Whisper model may not take these very fine utterances into account but the Diarization Model Nemo may include them leading to inconsistent results. Something like this Speaker A Its got to come from somewhere Speaker B else. Yeah Speaker A that ones also fun because you know the Speaker C lows are Speaker A going to suck right So only Speaker A was speaking. Others hmm yeah were ignored by Whisper but because the Diarization model was able to give us timestamps for them we saw this inconsistent output. Fortunately our punctuationbased realignment will fix that. Some special cases are hard to fix i. e. when we have an equal part of both sentences split between two Speakers. Something like Speaker A Oh Speaker B Yeah. Speaker A Yeah Speaker B Exactly. Unfortunately our punctuationbased realignment algorithm cant fix these errors. We have to accept them as part of the diarization error. Our realignment algorithm will assign them to either of the speakers. Although whisper will automatically punctuate its transcripts it may end up in a nopunctuation loop occasionally and you may not get any punctuation markings. To avoid that we can restore whisper transcripts punctuation marking using a pretrained model. Thank you for reading and I hope you found this useful.

87,CES 2023 presents an exciting future for gaming laptops,"18"" gaming laptops shown at CES with 16:10 panels combat the trend of ultra-slim models and avoid gimmicks that",https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/ces-2023-future-gaming-laptops,CES 2023 presents an exciting future for gaming laptops 18 laptops make a return at CES and Im here for it. Im sure you already noticed but CES 2023 is in full swing this week. The consumer electronics show has manufacturers showing off revisions to their existing ranges and allnew expansions into territories in dire need of a shakeup. Gigantic 18 gaming laptops with 1610 panels are among some of the most surprising reveals at the convention in Las Vegas especially since a recent trend of portable gaming hardware leaning into making everything ultracompact and lightweight sometimes at the cost of performance potential. Abandoning realtime rendering entirely and opting for cloud gaming seemed like the intense focus for many gaming divisions towards the end of the last year including the Razer Edge handheld with its beautiful 6. 8 AMOLED panel hitting 144Hz refresh rates while streaming AAA titles demonstrated at Razers CES booth this week. Nothing in my opinion can replace the experience of genuine liveaction gaming with a powerhouse laptop from ASUS ROG STRIX a wealth of options from MSI or the expanded Lenovo Legion Pro lineup. To my delight my favorite gaming brands have brought some exciting prospects to the table in Nevada this year. However some alarming gimmicks within laptops shown elsewhere in the show have yet to sell me on their usefulness. Does CES think 3D is still future tech Athome and portable screens with threedimensional gimmicks have been an outstretched trend pushed by technology companies that have never convinced me of their longterm appeal. Ive always given them a shot at the beginning whether watching movies in the cinema with garish oversized sunglasses just for characters to reach out a gigantic hand every few minutes or occasionally adjusting the depth slide on my Nintendo 3DS before disabling it forever. Even virtual reality has imperfections and the highestgrade VR headsets still suffer from the occasional glitch that makes your view hitch which can take you out of the immersive experience and even cause some motion sickness. At least for gaming the nature of entering a virtual world is more exciting thanks to the improvements to controllers such as perfinger tracking and grip detection. Our managing editor Richard Devine had handson experience with this kind of tech via ASUS Spatial Vision opens in new tab. So far CES 2023 has proved that manufacturers are keen to keep this tech separated from machines focused on 3D model creation rather than gaming. Some side effects from modern gaming components such as the NVIDIA RTX graphics cards come in the way of the NVIDIA Broadcast Studio enhancing video and audio for live streaming and conference calls. Still its better off staying that way and Im glad this obsession with 3D panels has avoided the latest gaming laptops. It might appeal to creators and Im open to testing its applications as a novice Blender user creating 3D models but my intrigue stops there. Budgetunfriendly GPUs Gaming laptops can be fantastic value for more than mobile access to your libraries of PCexclusive titles even beyond being a fullyfledged Windows machine. There was a significant stretch where I didnt have a desktop machine opting for a highend laptop that remained on my desk connected to an external monitor and peripherals. Buying a gaming laptop that happens to contain a premium graphics card is a similarly clever tactic to choosing a prebuilt tower over constructing your own. Brandnew GPUs have had an unfortunate reputation in recent years for being wildly overpriced compared to their implied MSRP opens in new tab but grabbing them as part of a complete package can shave off some of the cost. Even the justreleased GeForce RTX 4070 Ti opens in new tab has entirely skipped an official NVIDIA model leaving thirdparty manufacturers to charge whatever they like. Bagging a cuttingedge AMD Radeon RX 7000series or NVIDIA RTX 4000series alongside the latest range of confusinglynamed AMD Ryzen 7000 opens in new tab or Intel 13th Gen Core mobile processors opens in new tab without destroying your bank account seems to rank from reasonably attainable to a complete pipedream with some of the CES 2023 offerings. At the cheaper end for 2023 Lenovos 16 Legion Pro laptops come in four flavors. The 5 5i 7 and 7i models vary primarily on processor choice but feature a vague nextgen NVIDIA GeForce option for graphics cards. If the 1460 Legion Pro 15 can manage at least a mobile RTX 4050 then the highend Legion Pro 7i at 2000 could see anything up to the mobile 4090. Its a decent option for performance parts without getting too crazy on prices. On the other end of the spectrum ASUS has gone allin with its 14 ROG Zephyrus duo opens in new tab laptop featuring minimalistic changes to the aesthetic but monstrous performance lurking underneath. Its 16core AMD Ryzen 9 Zen 4 CPU pairs with the highest NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 mobile GPU alongside its famed twin screens the slim lower panel showing live diagnostics extended game stats or anything you choose for a cool 4000. It may be extreme for most people but ASUS has earned its place in the enthusiast category after years of manufacturing extremely highperformance PC components. Finding the balance Personally meeting in the middle for cost with the benefit of expanding to a 16 or 18 panel via the latest lineup of Razer Blade laptops opens in new tab appeals to me the most out of everything shown at CES so far. The revealed spec sheets make your graphics options as clear as day with choices from a GeForce RTX 4060 4070 4080 or even a beefy 4080Ti mobile GPU. Line those up with the killer Intel Core 13th Gen i913950HX processor and 32GB of DDR55600 RAM and youre already hitting some of the highest specs for a portable gaming machine starting at around 2900. Its still a significant number at a glance but considering the CPU and GPU alone would set you back well over a thousand dollars at MSRP packaging them into a beautiful Razerbranded enclosure with a 240Hz 1600p panel is a nobrainer if you have the budget. Overall Im ecstatic to see 1610 panels making a real comeback for gaming laptops this year. The return of a chunky 18 form factor allows for some highend performance components inside each. And while glassesfree 3D display tech is fascinating to experience in person Im glad its kept separate from some potential additions to the best gaming laptops. The biggest downside to CES is waiting for everything to be released to consumers properly but Im excited to see how these beasts perform with realworld testing throughout 2023.

At this years Consumer Electronics Show the company announced partnerships with significant suppliers and automakers. Several automakers including Tesla and BMW already use Nvidia technology in safety and infotainment systems. MercedesBenz currently uses the companys designs in its Hyperscreen system and said it would work with Nvidia on a digital recreation of its Rastatt Germany assembly facility. The automaker will plan production changes in a virtual environment saving time and money. Some companies will lean on Nvidias gaming heritage for invehicle entertainment and cloud gaming services. Going beyond rearseat entertainment systems the tech will make things more entertaining for drivers stuck at charging stations. The Nvidia GeForce Now gaming service features more than 1500 games so theres plenty to work with. BYD Hyundai and Polestar said they would offer the service. Foxconn the company behind the production of Fiskers new EVs said it would use Nvidias tech in its new vehicles. The move will make the company a tierone supplier and it said Nvidia chips would be a part of the ECUs electronic control units it supplies to global automakers.

Maybe thats why Im not one Portal with RTX is a gorgeous return to Aperture Science a borderline mustplay for anyone with a premium GeForce RTX GPU and a mightily impressive demonstration of the Nvidia RTX Remix tools that built it. Admittedly thats in spite of some shortcomings including utterly broken performance on even the strongest Radeon RX graphics cards. Equip yourself with RTX hardware however and this free mod is a real Christmas treat. If you missed the RTX 40 series launch event at which it was revealed RTX Remix is essentially a modding platform that makes it possible to add ray tracing and Nvidia DLSS upscaling to certain Direct 8 and DirectX 9 games. It includes tools for replacing textures and models too so could be thought of as a remastering engine old game goes in some buttons are pressed shiny new ray traced version comes out. Its obviously more complicated than that but in the hands of talented modders RTX Remix could be a very powerful collection of tools indeed. And to show whats possible Nvidias inhouse Lightspeed Studios who also made Quake II RTX have wielded them to create Portal with RTX. It rocks. Not only is the whole game now lit and shadowed with path tracing the most complex and visually complete subset of ray tracing thats currently technically possible but Lightspeed Studios have overhauled textures and models throughout. The result is a remaster thats not far off looking like a shotforshot remake with effects that actually serve the game rather than acting as technoswagger for its own sake. White lights from the test chambers observation rooms are brighter and harsher heightening the lab rat antifantasy. Flying energy orbs gain a dazzling glow emphasising their electric lethality. Even the redesigned wall and floor textures have more of a laboratoryappropriate sterility to them without being so pristine as to undermine Apertures figurative and literal grossness. And in fact Portals spacewarping makes it an ideal showcase for ray tracing. Ive seen plenty of twirling fan blade shadows and blooming lamps by now but Ive never stopped to marvel at an RT effect like I did the first time I saw a swath of light pour through one portal to reflect on surfaces around the second. And together with all the other little touches and tweaks its not remotely incongruous to see in a 15yearold game ray tracing looks like it was always meant to be there. RTX Remix isnt available to everyone yet but in the right hands its clearly dripping with potential for other impressive visual mods. Source Enginefocused YouTuber Richter Overtime has already piggybacked on Portal with RTX to get a glimpse of a ray traced Ravenholm in HalfLife 2 and provided modders dont run roughshod over the art direction of originals its tempting to imagine a library of remastered classics that dont involve a publisher charging you 50 for entry. Remember though this is ultimately an Nvidia joint and as brilliant as it is Portal with RTX does have the slight whiff of trying to sell graphics cards as much as it is RTX Remix. For one thing your only hope of truly high framerates is the latest RTX 40 series. With an RTX 4080 the cheapest of which are about 1250 I could leave the ray tracing settings on Ultra mode while staying above 60fps at 4K and 120fps at 1440p but that was only with DLSS 3 on its Performance setting plus the AI frame generation feature switched on. Older RTX cards must rely on an older version of DLSS which means no extra generated frames. Combined with their lower overall horsepower its a big challenge to get Portal with RTX running smoothly. Even the RTX 3090 again using DLSS Balanced struggled to get above the 5060fps range at 1440p with Ultra RT. You can lower these settings independently from the games own graphics options by opening an almost hidden Remix menu with AltX and thats an absolute necessity on the more mainstream Ampere GPUs. The RTX 3070 could just about tick along at 3040fps but only with Ultra settings dropping to High and with DLSS Performance once again. Thats almost exactly the same as my results with the Turingera RTX 2080 Ti so even deeper cuts are necessary if youre on something like an RTX 2060 or RTX 2070. 1080p might be your limit with those though at any resolution you can get a decent performance bump by dropping the minimum number of ray traced light bounces to 0 and the maximum to 2. Dont set the latter any lower than this mind you as it will make a lot of areas look inexplicably dark. Its also fine to stick with DLSS on Performance mode as its much faster than Balanced mode while thanks to Portals naturally clean lines rarely looking as pixelly as it does in most DLSSsupporting games. Sadly theres no saving performance on AMD cards. Even on the brandnew Radeon RX 7900 XT currently AMDs second most powerful gaming GPU Portal with RTX struggled to break 20fps at 1440p. The lack of a compatible upscaler is the least of its problems too in the footage below you can see not only my rising bewilderment but also how aliasing gets almost comically out of control and portals fail to render their exits. Best case scenario this is an issue specific to Portal with RTX and while theres no way in hell future RTX Remix mods will support FSR they might still be able to reach 45fps on a highend AMD GPU without reality breaking down. With a harder head Im worried that Remix mods will simply not work on Radeon hardware as a matter of course. That would make economic sense for Nvidia Im sure but wouldnt exactly be in the spirit of PC gaming. And thats something rarely said about yknow mod tools. All that said if you can play Portal with RTX I still think its too good to pass up. Its a visually sumptuous yet respectful redux of one of the best games ever made costs nothing when you already own the original and is easily installed through Steam. Just resist the urge to splash out on an RTX 4090 when performance takes a dip.,2022-12-22T11:41:12Z
91,ATX 3.0: Do You Need to Upgrade Your PSU For Nvidia's RTX 40-Series GPUs?,"Nvidia's RTX 40-Series GPUs are power-hungry, but do you need to upgrade your PSU to accommodate?",https://www.makeuseof.com/atx-3-do-you-need-upgrade-psu-nvidia-rtx-40-gpus/,Nvidias RTX 40Series has been the topic of much controversy since its launch. From high prices to potential scalping problems to confusing names Nvidia has had to jump multiple hoops just to get these cards on the market. However the problem thats arguably the most annoying is the power draw issues affecting these behemoth GPUs. Monstrous power demands are why some people are questioning the 40Series GPUs the new ATX 3. 0 PSU standard and whether you really need to upgrade your PSU to run the new Nvidia GPUs. Do Nvidias RTX 40Series GPUs Draw More Power First up Nvidias RTX 40Series GPUs dont consume as much power as you think. So while you might see high TGP Total Graphics Power numbers on these GPUs they perform relatively efficiently as compared to their lastgeneration counterparts. For example when tested on 22 games at 4K 1440p and 1080p the RTX 4080 consumed less power on average coming in at 251 watts as compared to the previous generations RTX 3080 which was drawing 320 wattsits maximum rated TGP. Keep in mind that both cards are rated at a 320W TGP. The difference wasnt as notable when the GPUs were idle or playing video but the RTX 4080 still consumed less power than the 3080. Even in 4K the 3080s maximum power draw was 297W when running Control in the aforementioned test run by Nvidia. So despite what you might hear Nvidia has attempted to optimize these GPUs and lower the power draw. Youll also get similar results when comparing the RTX 4090 with the RTX 3090. While both cards are rated at the same TDP of 450W the 4090 performs significantly better at a similar power draw if not less. What Is ATX 3. 0 ATX 3. 0 is the new specification standard for Power Supply Units PSUs. The new design adds a new PCIe 5. 0 12VHPWR connector with 12 4 pins alongside the usual six or eightpin connection to supply GPUs with up to 600W of power. While that might not sound like a lot this new addition allows ATX 3. 0 PSUs to handle power spikes of up to 1800W although only for about 100 microseconds. However those 100 microseconds might just be enough to save your 1500 GPU from turning into a paperweight. Additionally this new connector also carries signals indicating its power capabilities to PCIeconnected devices. This enables power limitations to be set on components using PCIe including GPUs and SSDs. The RTX 40Series cards have suffered power spikes periodically but new ATX 3. 0 PSUs can handle those spikes instead of just giving up and bricking expensive parts inside your PC. Knowing how much power your PC needs is crucial to having a stable machine that makes the most out of its hardware. Other notable changes in the ATX 3. 0 specification include It can handle GPU excursions power spikes three times the cards power rating. The 12V rail can go as high as 12. 2V allowing for lower voltage drops. Up to 60 efficiency on a 10W load or 70 efficiency for 2 load of max rated capacity. Faster system wake up and power on signal. ATX 3. 0 is the first time PSUs have seen a major change since 2003 at least in terms of ATX standards. The GPU power spike problem is one of the most common GPU issues and has finally been officially recognized by Intel and PCISIG alike. Do You Need to Upgrade to ATX 3. 0 As long as your PSU meets Nvidias minimum power recommendations for the RTX 40Series your existing PSU will work just fine with the new GPUs. While the cards have five slots they come with a power adapter to make them compatible with existing six or eightpin PSUs. The PSU recommendations for RTX 40Series cards are as follows according to Nvidia RTX 4090 450W TGP850W minimum RTX 4080 320W TGP750W minimum RTX 4070 Ti 285W TGP700W minimum The most powerhungry GPU in the 30Series was the 3090 Ti which required a minimum 850W PSU. As you can see the 4090 has the same minimum PSU power requirement except you get more performance per watt. In case your power supply isnt up to the mark or if youre looking for signs to upgrade your PSU we strongly recommend you get a new and preferably ATX 3. 0 compatible one. Its never a bad idea to dish out extra cash on your PSU to protect your other components. Besides leaving a healthy amount of headroom on your PSU will give you peace of mind and room for overclocking. However youll likely hit a CPU or memory bottleneck before youre able to get the GPU to its limits. That said if the specifications listed above didnt change your mind another reason you might want to upgrade your PSU is fewer cables. The 40Series GPUs use the PCIe Gen 5 connector that allows you to power the GPUs with just one cable. So when accounting for the total cable management youll have to deal with this becomes an important factor. Debunking Power Adapter Myths Finally if youre concerned about the power adapters provided with the GPUs to adapt them to ATX 2. 0 or other PSUs dont be. Nvidia has confirmed that the adapters carry active internal circuitry that translates the 8pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the ATX 3. 0 or PCIe Gen 5 specifications. The 30cycle lifetime on the new PCIe Gen 5 connectors is also nothing to worry about. It has basically remained the same for over two decades and hasnt changed with PCIe Gen 5 either. Another fun fact about these connectors is that the internal circuitry can detect the number of connectors plugged in meaning if youre connecting four connectors instead of the usual three itll allow the RTX 4090 to draw more power up to 600W. Power Efficiency Improvements in Nvidias RTX 40Series GPUs The Ada Lovelace architecture that the 40Series GPUs are based on brings major performance and power efficiency improvements. As a result these GPUs perform better than their predecessors while using far less power. The power requirements were ramped up but they werent as big as compared to the performance enhancements. While 30Series GPUs were limited in terms of boost clock speed by their overall power consumption on 40Series GPUs maximum clock speeds or voltage limits are being hit first. This allows Nvidia to further tune the cards and lower power levels for better efficiency. At the end of the day power efficiency enhancements do matter when it comes to your PCs overall performance. Not to mention a slightly cheaper electricity bill.,2023-01-11T14:20:01Z
92,Better Buy: Apple vs. Nvidia,Which tech titan is the better bear market investment?,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/12/25/better-buy-apple-vs-nvidia/,Apple AAPL 1. 01 and Nvidia NVDA 2. 35 were both beloved tech stocks that lost their luster over the past year. Apples stock hit an alltime high of 180. 96 in January but it subsequently stumbled back to the 130s. Nvidias stock closed at a record high of 333. 41 last November but it now trades in the 160s. Both stocks declined as inflation rising interest rates and other macro headwinds drove investors toward more conservative investments. Both companies also grappled with their own specific problems Apple faced slower sales of iPhones and supply chain disruptions while Nvidia struggled with the postpandemic slowdown of the PC market. Could either of these outoffavor tech stocks bounce back in 2023 and beyond Lets review their tailwinds headwinds and valuations to decide. What happened to Apple Apples revenue and earnings per share EPS increased 33 and 71 respectively in fiscal 2021 which ended in September 2021 after it finally entered the 5G market with its iPhone 12 family of smartphones. Its revenue and EPS rose another 8 and 9 respectively in fiscal 2022 even after it lapped that launch and faced new supply chain headwinds. For the full year Apples iPhone sales rose 7 and its Mac sales increased 14 even as the market for Windows PCs slumped while its Wearables Home and Accessories sales grew 7 as it sold more Apple Watches AirPods and other peripheral products. Its Services revenue also rose 14 as it locked in more than 900 million paid subscribers across its entire ecosystem. All of those growth engines offset its 8 decline in iPad sales. But fiscal 2023 will be a lot messier. Apples main contract manufacturer Foxconn grappled with disruptions in November as workers at its largest iPhone plant protested its COVID19 restrictions and unpaid bonuses. Apple already reduced its annual production target for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max from 90 million to 87 million units to account for those challenges but future protests could generate more unpredictable headwinds for Apple. Yet Apple still ended fiscal 2022 with 169 billion in cash and marketable securities and it bought back a whopping 550 million in shares over the past decade. That strong liquidity should make Apple an appealing investment as long as rising rates continue to crush unprofitable companies with weak cash flows. Apple is also widely expected to launch a new mixed reality headset next year and that product might just generate a fresh stream of hardware revenue. Based on those expectations analysts believe Apples revenue and earnings will grow 3 and 2 respectively this year. Those growth rates are steady but at 22 times forward earnings Apples stock isnt cheap yet. What happened to Nvidia Nvidia controlled 88 of the discrete GPU market in the third quarter of 2022 according to JPR. The remaining 12 was split between Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. Its revenue and adjusted EPS soared 53 and 73 respectively in fiscal 2021 which ended in January 2021. In fiscal 2022 its revenue rose another 61 as its adjusted EPS increased 78. Most of that growth was driven by three tailwinds Robust sales of PCs throughout the pandemic as more people worked remotely attended online classes and played more PC games. A growing interest in mining cryptocurrencies with gaming GPUs. Usage of more powerful GPUs in data centers to process complex machine learning and AI tasks. But in fiscal 2023 analysts expect its revenue to stay flat and for its EPS to slip by 27. That slowdown was caused by the postpandemic deceleration of the PC market sluggish sales in China amid the COVID19 lockdowns and tighter gaming restrictions and the crypto markets decline which all offset its robust sales of data center GPUs. The Biden administrations ban on advanced chip sales to China which impacts its toptier data center chips will exacerbate that slowdown. For fiscal 2024 analysts expect Nvidias revenue and earnings to rise 9 and 32 respectively as those markets gradually stabilize. But at 38 times forward earnings Nvidias stock still looks a bit pricey relative to its nearterm growth. But just like Apple Nvidia still has plenty of cash. It ended its latest quarter with 2. 8 billion in cash and equivalents and it bought back 8. 8 billion in shares throughout the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. That ample liquidity gives it plenty of room to develop new chips expand into new markets and acquire smaller companies even though antitrust regulators killed its proposed 40 billion takeover of SoftBanks Arm Holdings earlier this year. The obvious winner Apple Apple faces a nearterm slowdown but its business is much better diversified and less cyclical than Nvidias. Its also sitting on a lot more cash its stock is cheaper and it arguably has more options for expanding its portfolio of products and services than Nvidia. Therefore I firmly believe Apple is a better buy than Nvidia in this challenging market for tech stocks.,2022-12-25T13:10:00Z

As far as I can tell their Sphynx Ampere toiletries do not smell like new graphics cards so who cares However This does make me wonder which PC gaming smells would you like as a shower gel perfume deodorant aftershave air freshener or such What are the good smells of PC gaming Which would you eagerly accept as a boxed toiletry set from your aunt this Christmas Ill go first. Ive always enjoyed the sharp and pungent smell of ozone which heralds a catastrophic hardware failure. An old power supply about to go. A new graphics card which will cause immediate disappointment. An alarming scent which has no place in a normal environment. A scent which makes you go What is that OH NO. Id quite like that. Of course perfumes are rarely composed of a single scent so I can expand this desire to a complete product. As an amateur bog personselkienaiadsapient lump of moss which somewhat resembles a human being when viewed from a specific angle I ache for good dank smells. Trust me Ive tried so many and they usually come up wanting. So what I would want from a PC gaming scent is an old PC booting up in a mossy glade. Just imagine A base of earth and moss and wet and fungus and rotting stumps and decay. An intoxicating note of douglas fir that pine cut through by zesty grapefruit. Then a 486 which has sat out in this forest for decades the raw ozone of its ancient power supply and mechanical hard drive spluttering and grinding into life as you boot up. And on top just a hint of sweet must from the damp dust inside the PSU drying out then burning away. Lovely. Ive asked around the RPS treehousewhich I assure you smells wonderfuland have received a few more scent suggestions scentgestions. I would like something that smells like the satisfaction of scraping fluff out of your keyboard RPS deputy editor Alice Bee tells me. Not the fluff itself which I assume would smell catastrophic. Hardware editor James bravely tested reports from a lot of people saying the Steam Deck vent smelled nice as it got hotter. He returned two minutes later to declare it smells like the printer section of the PC World in Swindon that I sometimes went in when my dad needed office supplies. I do not know if that is good or bad. Lets bottle that scent either way. This proved controversial when vidbud Liam noticed. I think only chatlogs can capture it Liam RichardsonNow hold on a moment here The Steam Deck Vent Smeller has LOGGED ON That thing smells like a dream Quite often when I die in a game Ill tilt that bad boy towards my nostrils and allow myself a little treat smell It smells like EGX on day one. Fresh plastic. Its the best. Starting to think the reason my Steam Deck isnt functioning properly is because Ive smelled all its power out of the vent Huffed away the teraflops We may need opinions from you to settle the Steam Deck vent scent matter. What else do you fancy sniffing reader dear Lets trust that all of these would definitely smell good no matter how awful they may seem in words. A few potential thoughts to get you started. The smell of a new graphics card The rich smell of a chunky paper manual The strange factory smell inside a freshly unwrapped DVD case The scratchandsniff card included with Leather Goddesses Of Phobos The many metallic scents of blood spilled on sharp motherboard pins I dont know the pleather of a new uncomfortable racerback gamer chair I suppose you could also pick scents from PC games yearning to sniff the virtual if you find nothing desireable in the physical.

94,Intel has spared a part of its chips business from the chopping block for now (for now),Intel opted to restructure the graphics chips business to improves its standing against rivals Nvidia and AMD,https://qz.com/intel-split-graphics-unit-nvidia-amd-dgpu-competition-1849922166,Intel is breaking up rather than simply cutting its graphic chips unit. Yesterday Dec. 22 the company said its splitting its accelerated computing systems and graphics group abbreviated as AXG into two. One arm responsible for the development of discrete Graphics Processor Units GPUs will slot under Intels client computing group. The other highperformance computing HPC accelerators will join its data center and artificial intelligence business. The restructuring of the graphics chips business signals Intels intention to renew efforts to take on Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. The market leader in integrated GPUswhere the graphics card is part of the CPU a product where Intel also leadshas failed to make a mark in the discrete GPU dGPU space. Charted Nvidia is winning in dGPUs Intel trails Nvidia in discrete graphics cards The AXG group formed in 2016 has so far guzzled 3. 5 billion with little to show for itespecially when it comes to the development of dGPUs which has been growing in demand among PC and laptop gamers and has several other use cases in banking automotives and more. Intels foray into graphics cards earlier this year after a 24yearhiatus from the space didnt go smoothlysoftware problems crippled its hardware sales. It remedied the code causing the snag and is not looking to get an even bigger piece of the discrete graphics card pie. Intel not only continues to be overshadowed by market leader Nvidia but its also struggling to match semiconductor company AMD the rapidly rising innovator. In July analyst Jon Peddie said Intel should probably dump the AXG group as part of its austerity measures. In the six years since it was formed AMD and Nvidia have brought out three generations of new and stunningly powerful dGPUs and more are in the pipeline. Four new companies have started up in China and two new ones announced in the US. Intel is now facing a much stronger AMD and Nvidia plus six startupsthe rules of engagement have dramatically changed while Intel sunk money into projects it cant seem to get off the ground Peddie wrote in his blogpost. But it doesnt look like Intel is axing the business just yet. Discrete graphics and accelerated computing are critical growth engines it said yesterday. We are evolving our structure to accelerate and scale their impact and drive gotomarket strategies with a unified voice to customers. Person of interest Raja Koduri Raja Koduri came to Intel in 2017 armed with experience from iPhone maker Apple and chips company AMD. Most recently he was leading the graphic chips unit that was just bifurcated and reorganized. With the recent shakeup hes poised to return to his role as chief architect to oversee the companys longterm technology and chip design strategy. One more thing Intel and other chip makers are struggling Intel which plans to cut 10 billion in costs through 2025 has had to make some tough calls in the middle of continued macroeconomic headwinds. In the middle of 2022 it shut down its Optane memory suffering a 559 million inventory writeoff in the process. Come early 2023 it will lay off 200odd employees. Chipmaker Micron Technology announced yesterday Dec. 21 that it will lay off 10 of its staff and cut spending as it falls prey to several headwinds including high inflation rising interest rates geopolitical tensions and Chinas covid policies and more.

Everybody's getting game: Automakers show off in-car entertainment at CES originally appeared on…",https://www.autoblog.com/2023/01/07/in-car-gaming-ces/,LAS VEGAS What started out as a novelty offered by Elon Musk to Tesla owners has turned into table stakes in the next generation of electric vehicles. Automakers from Sony Honda to Hyundai are introducing ways at the CES 2023 technology trade show this week to reshape the incar entertainment experience including offering video games during the rides. They are positioning themselves to take advantage of the time people spend in their cars as a source of potentially lucrative recurring revenue. This is a field which can be deployed very quickly Dirk Hilgenberg head of Volkswagen AGs CARIAD software unit told Reuters at CES. You could just host the thirdparty app for a streaming service or generate joint platforms. You guarantee certain volumes you guarantee certain revenue. While car radios have been an entertainment staple in vehicles for decades Tesla vehicles have reset consumer expectations with the ability to watch popular video streaming services such as Netflix YouTube and Hulu while the vehicle is parked and charging. In December Tesla issued a holiday update to its software to add access to 1000 PC games through the Steam platform. Other automakers are making the same moves. In October BMW announced a partnership with AirConsole to bring casual gaming into its vehicles. Stellantis last year announced plans to add Amazon. com Incs Fire TV for Auto to its new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs. In Las Vegas South Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor Co said it would use technology developed by Nvidia Corp a company whose chips power PC gaming to stream games in cars. Nvidias cloudbased game service known as GeForce Now would provide access to more than 1000 titles from PC game stores such as Steam as well as freetoplay games such as Fortnite. Chinas BYD and Swedish electric vehicle brand Polestar also are working with Nvidia. Japans Sony the maker of the marketleading PlayStation video game console on Wednesday at CES said its newly christened electric vehicle Afeela would be powered by the same Unreal Engine 3D technology used in video games. Sony promised best in class movies games and music though it offered few details on the vehicle it is developing jointly with Honda Motor Co. In order to realize intelligent mobility continuous software updates and highperformance computing are required Yasuhide Mizuno chief executive of Sony Honda Mobility told the trade show. Afeela prototype from Sony Honda Mobility Image Credit Sony Honda Mobility The auto industry has been grappling with how to introduce these new features safely and restrict use to passengers while the vehicle is in operation. Tesla became the focus of regulators in 2021 following reports that one feature allowed drivers to play games on the cars tabletlike touch screen. Tesla disabled the feature while the car was in motion. Hilgenberg said Volkswagen is developing vehicles that can drive themselves on the highway or in traffic jams which could give drivers and passengers more time to view videos or play games. But those vehicles will have safety systems that could shut down gaming or video displays to the driver if conditions made automated driving unsafe he said. Still these are features that consumers are demanding so VW is at CES seeking partnerships. In some regions we will see people say You dont have that Im not buying Hilgenberg said. We will see the content... which is provided by software enabled functionality will be a decisive factor for buying.,2023-01-07T14:00:00Z

Alternatives Inside Posted on April 04 2020 and tagged as powershell For years Ive seen blog posts scripts forum messages you name it all referencing the Win32Product WMI class when someone is looking for a way to list installed applications on a Windows system. This method seems to be exceptionally prevalent and can be dangerous. Lets find out why. Reasons not to query Win32Product Its slow The least important reason is that its not very fast. On my admittedly ancient i7 with an SSD for the OS volume it takes over a minute. PS C MeasureCommand GetCimInstance Win32Product. TotalSeconds 68. 4418397 It potentially returns incomplete data Win32Product will only return applications installed via Windows Installer. There are many products used to assemble installers that dont build Windows Installer packages. Any applications that use these nonWindows Installer packages for deployment wont be returned when Win32Product is queried. It runs a consistency check on all applications and performs automatic and silent repairs Yes you read that right. This is the big one and is the reason for the poor performance. When you run a command such as GetCimInstance Win32Product it causes every single application installed via Windows Installer to perform a consistency check and if any problems are found it runs an automated and silent repair. Have a look at the Application Event Log after running the above command preferably on a test system. Here is the message inside the entries obviously with a different product named in each event. There is some good documentation from Microsoft on this in KB974524. Win32product Class is not query optimized. Queries such as select from Win32Product where name like Sniffer require WMI to use the MSI provider to enumerate all of the installed products and then parse the full list sequentially to handle the where clause. This process also initiates a consistency check of packages installed verifying and repairing the install. Ill also note that the WMI class Win32regAddRemovePrograms referenced in the above KB only exists on systems where the SCCM agent is installed it is not included in the standard Windows WMI namespace. Anecdotal evidence Like many others I too first reached for Win32Product before I knew better. One one occasion it caused a BSOD on an Exchange server. This was a long time ago and I wouldnt expect the same thing to happen today and to be fair the server was superbly underspecced and in a poor state to begin with but it did leave me scarred. Now that we know what not to do how do we pull installed applications Querying The Registry The simplest and fastest alternative has been to query the registry. There are paths one for 32bit and one for 64bit applications that are used to populate the AddRemove Programs table and we can query those instead. Apps Apps GetItemProperty HKLMSOFTWAREWow6432NodeMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstall 32 Bit Apps GetItemProperty HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstall 64 Bit To compare run times the above takes 2. 159 seconds on my PC. And we get much the same information as the WMI command PS C Apps84 DisplayName WinPcap 4. 1. 3 UninstallString CProgram Files x86WinPcapuninstall. exe Publisher Riverbed Technology Inc.

CoreRegistryHKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstall PSChildName WinPcapInst PSDrive HKLM PSProvider Microsoft. PowerShell. CoreRegistry One caveat is that this method will return many more elements than Win32Product it will include things such as service packs Office updates language packs etc. You will most likely need to invest a little time in filtering out things you arent interested in. On my PC Win32Product returned 493 items whereas the registry method returned 862. However this does not find applications installed into a users profile which is where things can get a little more complicated. Finding apps that install into AppData There has been a growing trend of application vendors making installers that deploy to a users profile userprofileAppData. This is commonly done much to the dismay of the IT departments to allow users to install programs without needing administrative privileges. These applications will also have their installation documented in the registry but under HKEYCURRENTUSER instead of HKEYLOCALMACHINE. This poses a few challenges. Each users registry hive is located in their profile as userprofileNTUSER. DAT. If a user is logged in this can be accessed by otheradministrative users on the system via the HKEYUSERSACCOUNTSIDkey If a user is not logged in the hive can be manually mounted using REG LOAD. One catch is that if a users registry hive is already loaded i. e. they are logged in it cannot be loaded again as we will get a The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. error. So well need to enumerate a list of profiles in the system determine whether we need to load their registry hive mount it if we need to pull the application install data and finally unload the hive. The last part is important failing to do so will leave the user unable to log in due to the same error we encountered above. The first part of finding a list of profiles and determining whether theyre currently loaded is made easy by quering Win32UserProfile localpath sid loaded special CUsers.

Systemspecific DXVA2 DirectX 12 Video MediaCodec VAAPI VDPAU XvMC XvBA YAMI V4L2 OMX etc.. Vendorspecific Quick Sync MFX Avivo AMF Crystal HD CUVID NVDEC NVENC RKMPP Others Im sure Ive forgotten... System AND vendor specific Videotoolbox All of those APIs come with quirks. Some insist that you can only use up to 31 frames which is problematic for complex transcoding chains. Some insist that you preallocate all frames during initialization which is memoryinefficient. Most require your H264 stream to be in AnnexB for no good reason. Some even give you VP9 packets in some unholy unstandardized AnnexB. Some require that you give them raw NALs others want outofband NALs and slices and some do both. If you wanted to do processing on hardware video frames your options were limited. Most of the APIs let you export frames to OpenGL for presentation. Some of the more benevolent APIs let you import frames back from OpenGL or DRM. A few of them also let you do OpenCL processing. And of course all of this happened with little to no synchronization. Artifacts like video tearing block decoding not quite being finished missing references are commonplace even nowadays. Most APIs being stateful made compensating for missing references or damaged files difficult. Finally attempting to standardize this jungle is Vulkan video. Rather than a compromise it is lowlevel enough to describe most quirks of video acceleration silicon and with a single codepath let you decode and encode video with relative statelessness. Implementationwise so far there had only been a single example the vkvideosamples repository. As far as example code goes I wouldnt recommend it. Moreover it uses a closed source parsing library. I wrote and maintain the Vulkan code in FFmpeg so it fell on me to integrate video decoding and encoding. At the same time Dave Airlie started writing a RADV Mesas Vulkan code for AMD chips implementation. With his invaluable help in a few weeks minus some months of inactivity we have working and debuggable opensource driver implementation and a clean and performant API user code. Technical aspects The biggest difference between Vulkan video and other APIs is that you have to manage memory yourself specifically the reference frame buffer. Vulkan calls it the Decoded Picture Buffer DPB which is a rather MPEGese term but fair enough. There are three possible configurations of the DPB Previous output pictures are usable as references. 1 Centralized DPB pool consisting of multiple images. 2 Centralized DPB pool consisting of a single image with multiple layers. 3 In the first case you do not have to allocate any extra memory but merely keep references of older frames. FFmpegs hwaccel framework does this already. Intels video decoding hardware supports this behavior. In the second case for each output image you create you have to allocate an extra image from a pool with a specific image usage flag. You give both the output the outputs separate reference DPB image and all previous reference DPB images and the driver then writes to your output frame while simultaneously also writing to the DPB reference image for the current frame. Recent AMD Navi21 and most Nvidia hardware support this mode. In the third case the situation is identical to the second case only that you have to create a single image upfront with as many layers as there are maximum references. Then when creating a VkImageView you specify which layer you need based on the DPB slot. This is a problematic mode as you have to allocate all references you need upfront even if theyre never used. Which for 8k HEVC video is around 3. 2 gigabytes of Video RAM. Older AMD hardware requires this. Another difference with regards to buffer management is that unlike other APIs which all managed their own references with Vulkan you have to know which slot in the DPB each reference belongs to. For H264 this is simply the picture index. For HEVC after considerable trial and error we found to be the index of the frame in the DPB array. slot is not a standard term in video decoding but in lieu of anything better its appropriate. Apart from this the rest is mostly standard. Like NVDEC VDPAU DXVA slice decoding is sadly not supported which means you have to concatenate the data for each slice in a buffer with start codes 4 then upload the data to a VkBuffer to decode from. Somewhat of an issue with very high bitrate video but at least Vulkan lets you have spare and host buffers to work around this. Unlike other decoding APIs which let you only set a few SPS PPS and VPS in HEVC fields you have to parse and set practically every single field from those bitstream elements. For HEVC alone the total maximum possible struct size for all fields is 114 megabytes which means you really ought to pool the structure memory and expand it when necessary because although its unlikely that you will get a stream using all possible values anyone can craft one and either corrupt your output or crash your decoder. Vulkan video requires that multiplane YUV images are used. Multiplane images are rather limiting as theyre not wellsupported and if youd like to use them to do processing you have to use DISJOINT images with an EXTENDED creation flag to be able to create VkImageViews with STORAGE usage flags which are even less supported and quirky. Originally the FFmpeg Vulkan code relied entirely on emulating multiplane images by using separate images perplane. To work Vulkan video into this I initially wrote some complicated ALIASing code to alias the memory from the separate VkImages to the multiplane VkImage necessary for decoding. This eventually got messy enough to make me give up on the idea and port the entire code to allow for firstclass multiplane support. What wouldve helped wouldve been some foreknowledge of the drafting process but lacking this as well as any involvement in the standardization refactoring is necessary. Code As of 20221219 the code has not yet been merged into mainline FFmpeg. My branch can be found here. There is still more refactoring necessary to make multiplane images firstclass which would be good enough to merge but for now its able to decode both H264 and HEVC video streams in 8bit and 10bit form.

To decode 10bit content you must replace formatnv12 with formatp010formatyuv420p10. To use a different Vulkan device replace vulkanvk0 with vulkanvkN where N is the device index youd like to use. This will produce a OUT. nut file containing the uncompressed decoded data. You can play this using ffplay mpv or VLC. Alternatively there are many resources on how to use the FFmpeg CLI and output whatever format youd like. Nonsubsampled 444 decoding is possible provided drivers enable support for it. Driver support Currently as of 20221219 there are 3 drivers supporting Vulkan Video. RADV ANV Nvidia Vulkan Beta drivers For RADV Dave Airlies radvvulkanvideoprelimdecode branch is necessary. RADV has full support for Vulkan decoding 8bit H264 8bit and 10bit HEVC. The output is speccompliant. For installation instructions check out Daves blog. For ANV his anvvulkanvideoprelimdecode branch is needed instead. ANV has partial support for H264 certain streams may cause crashes. For installation instructions check out Daves blog. For Nvidia the Vulkan Beta drivers are necessary. Only Linux has been tested. The drivers produce compliant 8bit HEVC decoding output with my code. 10bit HEVC decoding produces slight artifacts. 8bit H264 decoding is broken. Nvidia are looking into the issues progress can be tracked on the issue thread I made. StateFuture Currently Im working with Dave Airlie on video encoding which involves getting a usable implementation and drivers ready. The plan is to finish video encoding before merging the entire branch into mainline FFmpeg. The encoding extension in Vulkan is very low level but extremely flexible which is unlike all other APIs that force you onto fixed coding paths and often bad rate control systems. With good userlevel code even suboptimal hardware implementations could be made competitive with fast software implementations. The current code ignores the drivers rate control modes and will integrate with Daalarav1es RC system. Due to multiplane surfaces being needed for Vulkan encoding and decoding Niklas Haas is working on integrating support for them in libplacebo which would enable postprocessing of decoded Vulkan frames in FFmpeg and enable both mpv and VLC to display the decoded data directly. In the near future support for more codecs will hopefully materialize. When the driver sets VkVideoDecodeCapabilitiesKHR. flags VKVIDEODECODECAPABILITYDPBANDOUTPUTCOINCIDEBITKHR.

98,The Microsoft-Activision deal gives Lina Khan a $69 billion problem in 2023. Defeating it will set the tone on Big Tech deals for years to come.,"The FTC chair has made Big Tech her prime target, though Microsoft's purchase of ""Call of Duty"" developer Activision will throw up serious challenges.",https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-activision-deal-lina-khan-big-tech-deals-2023-1,The MicrosoftActivision deal gives Lina Khan a 69 billion problem in 2023. Defeating it will set the tone on Big Tech deals for years to come. The FTC has a 69 billion headache to deal with in 2023 in the form of Microsofts Activision buyout. Chair Lina Khan wants to rein in Big Tech but will be tested by one a Silicon Valley veteran. With Microsofts 69 billion takeover of game developer Activision due to complete by June this year the clock is ticking on what is set to test the FTCs commitment to reining in Big Tech under chair Lina Khan. Since arriving on the scene as chair in June 2021 Khan has picked fights with Microsofts Silicon Valley peers finding some success in delaying a Meta acquisition and targeting Amazon over issues around its Prime membership. The agency sued to block the Activision deal in December over concerns that the acquisition would prevent millions of gamers not tied into Microsofts Xbox and cloudgaming ecosystem from accessing popular Activision titles such as Call of Duty. On Tuesday FTC attorney James Weingarten said in a pretrial hearing that there had been no substantive discussions between parties despite there being just six months until the deadline for the deals closure. The outcome of the deal will have ramifications beyond Microsoft the rest of Silicon Valley lies in wait before making their next big moves as any decision will set the tone for Big Tech deals in years to come. A question of size This is not the first time the FTC has taken on Big Tech and the agency has zeroed in on Silicon Valleys dealings more than ever under Khans watch. What separates the FTCs crackdown on the MicrosoftActivision tieup from its other interventions is size the 69 billion deal is not just Microsofts biggest acquisition ever it is also the biggest deal the agency has contended with under Khan. Size raises the stakes for the agency and brings additional scrutiny but these arent the only challenges. Vertical mergers which see companies operating at different levels of production in an industry combine are trickier to build an antitrust case against than horizontal ones that see direct rivals combine such as Facebooks successful 2012 acquisition of Instagram. The MicrosoftActivision deal is seen as a vertical merger one in which the tech giant would be adding an additional video game developer to its existing roster of inhouse developers rather than creating a developer conglomerate that sees others combine under its watch. The most notable recent success the FTC has had with tackling vertical mergers came in December 2021 when it sued to block the 40 billion acquisition of SoftBankowned chip designer Arm by industry heavyweight Nvidia. The move triggered a series of events that eventually saw the deal collapse in February 2022 with Arm seeking to return to public markets as a plan B. At the time the FTC said the termination of what would have been the largest semiconductor chip merger will preserve competition for key technologies and safeguard future innovation. But the US government has previously struggled to see similar highprofile cases through with the Department of Justice losing its case to undo ATTs 80 billion purchase of Time Warner in February 2019 following a ruling from US District Court judge Richard Leon. Microsoft has argued that the FTCs probe is unconstitutional and marks an overreach in its exercising of power. Skilled negotiator Microsoft has also become a skilled negotiator learning from the bruising it took from antitrust regulators in the 1990s. In 1998 the US government accused Microsoft of abusing Windows popularity to ensure the dominance of Internet Explorer at the expense of rivals such as Netscape. It was a blockbuster case that saw Bill Gates appear on Capitol Hill to testify against claims that it violated the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. The court ultimately ruled that Microsoft had been in violation of the act. Though Microsoft successfully appealed against being broken up it did agree on settlements that would restrict some of its practices at the time such as forcing PC makers to work with them exclusively. Since that saga Microsoft has worked to avoid the watchful eye of regulators and found ways of negotiating to get what it wants. Take its 7. 5 billion deal to buy game developer Bethesda in September 2020 which had the potential to spark antitrust concerns the acquisition was finalized six months later after some concessions were made with worried EU regulators. It is likely that Microsoft will play a similar game with its Activision purchase. In November it emerged that Microsoft was considering offering a 10year licensing deal to PlayStation creator Sony that would make Activision games available to rivals that arent Xbox according to Reuters. That said Microsofts acquisition of Activision will prove even tougher to tackle than anything Amazon has thrown up for the FTC chief to date. Its success will depend on its ability to make a case against one of Silicon Valleys most experienced players as well as a deal type that has historically stood up to scrutiny. Failure will likely embolden Big Tech to test the waters further.
