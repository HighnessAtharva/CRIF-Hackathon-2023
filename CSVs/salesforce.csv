Back in November reports came out that the ecommerce giant was eliminating 10000 jobs just as other companies in the tech sector had announced layoffs of their own. Now the company is expanding its job cuts and between the employees whod already lost their jobs and the ones losing theirs in the near future Amazon will be eliminating over 18000 roles in the company. Jassy said majority of the upcoming layoffs would be from its retail and recruiting divisions. As The Wall Street Journal notes Amazon benefited from the COVID lockdowns over the past few years since people had to shop online more often than before. The company reportedly added hundreds of thousands of employees to keep up with the surge in demand and then launched costcutting reviews to see which units werent making profit. It then froze hiring closed brickandmortar stores and shut down business units. When news broke that Amazon was planning sweeping layoffs Meta had also just revealed that it was letting more than 11000 of its employees go. Like Amazons executives Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg significantly increased Metas investments following a large revenue growth due to the pandemic. However peoples spending habits eventually went back to prepandemic trends leading to a smaller revenue for the company. More recently Slack owner Salesforce revealed that its cutting 10 percent of its workforce and closing down offices. The company also grew rapidly during the pandemic and cant sustain its bloated workforce in the current economy. Amazon will be cutting more jobs than Meta did by the time its done. Jassy said the company will reach out to impacted employees starting on January 18th so the layoffs will likely take place over the coming weeks. He added that Amazon will offer them packages that include a separation payment transitional health insurance benefits and external job placement support.,2023-01-05T10:20:59Z

The environment remains challenging and our customers are taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions coChief Executive Officer Marc Benioff said in a letter to employees. As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn were now facing and I take responsibility for that Benioff added. Salesforce had 73541 employees at the end of January last year a 30 per cent jump from 2021. The companys growth has slowed during the past four quarters with Salesforce posting its weakest revenue increase in the third quarter.
