1,Elon Musk isnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt serious about giving power to a new CEO,"Elon Musk says that heÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂll still be in charge of TwitterÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs software and server teams after he resigns his CEO seat to ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂsomeone foolish enoughÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ to take the job. In a recent poll, Twitter users voted in favor of him stepping down.",https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/20/23520019/elon-musk-stop-twitter-ceo-software-server-teams,Elon Musk said Tuesday that hell still be in charge of Twitters software and server teams after he resigns his CEO seat to someone foolish enough to take it. He broke the news in a response to a poll he ran earlier this week where around 58 percent of respondents said that he should step down as CEO. Given that the social networking site is mainly made up of software and servers especially after the massive layoffs its clear Musk will still have direct control over the company even if he doesnt have the explicit CEO title. Thats not necessarily a surprise Musk has defacto control over product at most of his companies and hes still Twitters owner at the end of the day. But the announcement likely means disappointment for anyone hoping that him stepping down as CEO would bring an end to Twitters wild rollercoaster ride. While Musk has indicated that hes mainly interested in the Twitter users that are willing to pay him for the service there are another group of people he has to satisfy Tesla shareholders. The companys share price has been tumbling since Musk bought Twitter dropping almost 100 in value since November 1st down to around 137 when markets closed on Tuesday. Musk has several times blamed the drop on interest rates making saving more appealing than investing but some Tesla shareholders have raised concerns about the companys engineers going to work at Twitter and how Musks antics at Twitter reflect on his other companies. The only problem is the optics of having the CEO on Twitter every day discussing the problems of Hunter Biden said Ross Gerber a head of a firm invested in Tesla according to Business Insider. Musk has also sold billions in Tesla stock since he promised to stop doing that this spring and again in the summer. It seems likely that some of the money from the Tesla selloff went to help prop up Twitter. Unfortunately for Tesla shareholders a group that involves Musk whose shares once made him the worlds richest man until the stock price slip cost him that title it doesnt seem like Musk intends on stepping away from Twitter any time soon. Sure whoever he gets as CEO may be tasked with trying to corral advertisers and policymakers both of which have been suspiciously eyeing Twitters new management. But when it comes to the Twitter that people are actually using it sounds like Elon will still be Chief Twit.,2022-12-21T01:57:28Z,Elon Musk isnÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt serious about giving power to a new CEO,Somewhat Negative,280,"foolish, broke, disappointment, rollercoaster, concerns, problem, problems, Unfortunately, suspiciously",hell,"Elon, Musk, harassment, Musk, Musk, Musk, Musk, Musk, Musks, Hunter, Biden, Ross, Gerber, Musk, Musk, Musk, Elon"

But Tesla still managed to disappoint Wall Street throughout 2022 -- and the last quarter was no different.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/02/investing/tesla-deliveries-production/index.html,Tesla delivered a record number of cars last year as sales continued to grow by percentages any other major automaker would dream about. But Tesla still managed to disappoint Wall Street throughout 2022 and the last quarter was no different. The electric automaker delivered 1. 3 million vehicles in 2022 up 40 from 2021. It produced nearly 1. 4 million vehicles up 47 from the prior year. Yet the fourth quarter underwhelmed Tesla delivered only 405278 vehicles well below the median estimate of 431000 according to analysts polled by Refinitiv as recession fears and higher interest rates led to a slowdown in demand. Although 40 growth is nothing to sneeze at Teslas pace of growth is slowing. Deliveries nearly doubled in 2021 and more than quadrupled in 2020. Teslas TSLA stock plunged 65 in 2022 as demand weakened. Competition in electric vehicles from established automakers surged last year. The company missed its growth targets throughout the year and it scaled back production in China. Evidence of car buyers sinking interest in Teslas became apparent last month after the company announced a rare sale in a bid to clear out inventory. Tesla offered two rebates for buyers taking delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year initially offering a 3750 discount then doubling the rebate to 7500 with two weeks left in 2022. Investors were rattled by the rebates sending the stock plunging 37 in December alone. Tesla thanked customers and employees for helping the company achieve a great 2022 in light of significant Covid and supply chain related challenges throughout the year according to a statement released on Monday. The company also said it was proud of its growth and progress. We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds which again led to a further increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter the statement read. Tesla said it delivered 1. 25 million of its lessexpensive Model 3 and Model Y electric cars and nearly 67000 of its higherend Model X and Model X lines.,2023-01-02T17:49:41Z,"

3,Tesla Delivered a Record 1.31 Million Cars in 2022 Despite Elon,"Tesla delivered 1.31 million electric vehicles in 2022, a 40% increase year-over-year and a record for the company, despite a hot mess CEO who spent the year tweeting and throwing his brandsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂand $200 billion in net worthÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂin the toilet.Read more...",https://gizmodo.com/tesla-elon-musk-electric-car-deliveries-131-million-1849943789,Tesla delivered 1. 31 million electric vehicles in 2022 a 40 increase yearoveryear and a record for the company despite a hot mess CEO who spent the year tweeting and throwing his brandsand 200 billion in net worthin the toilet. The deliveries marked a new high for Tesla but they werent enough to make Wall Street happy. Analysts expected Tesla to ship 431000 cars in the fourth quarter but the company only managed to deliver 405000. Overall Tesla delivered 1. 2 million of its less expensive Model 3 and Y cars in 2022 and 66700 Model S and Model X cars which are higherend. On the production side Tesla whipped up 439000 vehicles in the fourth quarter which was notable given that the company rarely produces more cars than it delivers according to Reuters. Production increased by 47 yearoveryear to 1. 37 million cars. Since Tesla doesnt release specific sales data analysts use delivery numbers as one metric to measure the companys performance each quarter. We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds which again led to a further increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter the company said in a short statement alongside its production and delivery update. In addition Tesla thanked its customers employees and suppliers among others for helping it achieve a great 2022 in light of significant COVID and supply chain related challenges throughout the year. Teslas disappointing delivery numbers are the newest problem in the automakers pile of woes many of which were created by CEO Elon Musk who also owns Twitter and SpaceX. The companys stock started sliding rapidly downhill beginning in April when Musk decided he wanted to buy Twitter. He would spend the summer attempting to back out of that deal. Upon realizing he couldnt Musk begrudgingly completed his purchase much to the horror of investors who wanted the billionaire to focus on Tesla. Tesla stock fell 65 in 2022 and the company has been forced to deal with the fallout of Musks actions at Twitter which include laying off thousands of workers forcing people to sign a pledge to stay at an extremely hardcore Twitter firing the janitors and refusing to pay rent for the companys office space. And thats only a snapshot. There are growing indications that the Musk train wreck has soured Teslas devoted customers and investors on the billionaire. CNET reported that customers are canceling their preorders and terminating their leases. Some of the angry buyers posted that Musk is tanking the Tesla brand and that theyre embarrassed to drive their Teslas. Others say that their next electric car wont be a Tesla. Meanwhile Musk fans have become more critical of the man they once worshipped. In December major Tesla shareholder Leo KoGuan criticized the billionaire for abandoning the electric car company. Elon abandoned Tesla and Tesla has no working CEO KoGuan tweeted. Tesla needs and deserves to have working full time CEO.,2023-01-03T13:27:00Z,Tesla Delivered a Record 1.31 Million Cars in 2022 Despite Elon,Extremely Negative,450,"mess, expensive, disappointing, problem, downhill, fell, fallout, refusing, wreck, critical, criticized","toilet, firing, angry","Elon, Musk, Musk, Musk, Musks, Musk, Musk, Musk, Leo, KoGuan, Elon, KoGuan"
