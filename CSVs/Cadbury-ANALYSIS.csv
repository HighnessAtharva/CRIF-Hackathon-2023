Readers who have had the misfortune to encounter a Hershey bar will know exactly what Im talking about. Its wretched stuff isnt it If you are in possession of a sound mind and a few functioning taste buds then I dont see how you can possibly enjoy US chocolate. It tastes like sawdust thats been drowned in sugar and soaked with baby vomit. It tastes like that by the way because thats roughly what it is. American chocolate Im talking about the nonfancy stuff has a lot more sugar and a lot less cocoa than its European counterparts. Some producers also allegedly put their milk through a process called controlled lipolysis which produces butyric acid. Whats that when its at home Its something thats found in vomit. God knows what else Americans get up to in their chocolate factories. A lawsuit recently filed in New York alleges that Hershey which has the licence to produce Cadbury products in the US fails to disclose that some of its chocolate products contain unsafe levels of lead and cadmium. There may be identifiable reasons that explain why US chocolate is so gross but heres what I have a hard time understanding why do Americans who excel at many things stand for this Why are they so complacent about their terrible healthcare system and their chlorinated chicken and their rancid chocolate Im not being a chocolate snob here well Im only being a little bit of a snob because theres a serious side to this Europe is a lot stricter about many food additives than the US. Americans have basically been poisoned into believing that their chocolate tastes nice I reckon. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist,"

A New York man Christopher Lazazzaro filed the suit in Long Island federal court on 28 December. The suit against the massmarket chocolatier which in 1988 acquired the license to produce Cadbury products in the US seeks classaction status. The suit came two weeks after Consumer Reports published an article claiming some Hershey dark chocolate products exceeded California standards for the maximum allowable dose level MADL for lead and cadmium. Apparently the US Food and Drug Administration has no federal regulations on the amount of lead or cadmium contained in most foods. Either way massproduced American chocolate is full of all kinds of other crap anyway as another recent Guardian piece notes.

3,Hershey sued by New York man over ‘unsafe’ levels of metal in chocolate,Christopher Lazazzaro alleges mass-market chocolatier failed to reveal lead and cadmium in dark chocolate products to consumersA lawsuit filed in New York state alleges that the confectionary giant Hershey “fails to disclose” that some of its chocolate produc…,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/30/hershey-sued-lead-cadmium-chocolate-new-york,A lawsuit filed in New York state alleges that the confectionary giant Hershey fails to disclose that some of its chocolate products contain unsafe levels of lead and cadmium. A New York man Christopher Lazazzaro filed the suit in Long Island federal court on 28 December. The suit against the massmarket chocolatier which in 1988 acquired the license to produce Cadbury products in the US seeks classaction status. The suit came two weeks after Consumer Reports published an article claiming some Hershey dark chocolate products exceeded California standards for the maximum allowable dose level MADL for lead and cadmium. There are no federal lead and cadmium limits for most foods. Consumer Reports scientists used California standards as they deemed them the most protective available. The report said lead content in the Hershey Special Dark Mildly Sweet Chocolate bar exceeded the California MADL. The lawsuit filed in New York cites other Hershey items highlighted in the Consumer Reports expos including Lilys Extra Dark Chocolate 70 Cocoa and Lilys Extremely Dark Chocolate 85 Cocoa. Hersheys acquired Lilys in June 2021 for 425m according to the company. The suit contends that consumers look to product packaging and labels before making a purchase. It alleges that Hersheys advertising and marketing are false deceptive and misleading because they do not disclose the alleged high levels of lead and cadmium. High levels of lead and cadmium in food products is material to reasonable consumers because these chemicals pose serious health risk even in small dosages the suit contends. Consumers had no independent way of knowing about the lead and cadmium content of the Hershey products before buying them the suit says as the levels cannot be determined without extensive and expensive scientific testing. Customers therefore rely on Hershey to be truthful regarding the ingredients including the existence of lead and cadmium in the products the suit says. The suit alleges that Hershey knew and could not be unaware of the existence of lead and cadmium in the products given that it sources its ingredients and makes its products with exclusive knowledge of the quality control testing on the products and the ingredients contained therein. Lazazzaro claims to have believed he was buying products that contained only dark chocolate ingredients and therefore paid a premium to do so. Because of alleged misrepresentations and omissions about the presence of heavy metals Lazazzaro claims he and other consumers suffered an injury in the amount of the premium paid. Hershey and attorneys for Lazazzaro did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Lazazzaro does not appear to allege that he suffered lead poisoning from eating Hershey chocolate. The lawsuit is focused on alleged wrongdoing relating to marketing practices. Exposure to high levels of lead can cause health problems including anemia and weakness. Extreme cases of lead poisoning can cause kidney and brain damage. Children exposed to lead are at risk of brain and nervous system damage and learning and behavioral issues according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cadmium can be dangerous when ingested in large amounts the CDC says.,Man sues Hershey over lead levels found in chocolate bars,Extremely Negative,370,"['fails', 'unsafe', 'dark', 'sued', 'unsafe']","['Drug', 'crap']","['lawsuit', Christopher, Lazazzaro, Victoria, Bekiempis]"
4,Change isn’t graceful but we live in a graceless age. So happy new year – now get on with it! | Jack Vening,"What do you have to lose?

A new year which means its almost time for absolutely nothing to change. Here comes 2023 rushing forward like a wave taking some people on with it and once again dumping the rest of us a few feet from where we started. If youre anything like me youve never put real effort into fixing yourself at the beginning of each new year. By now we all know that nobody changes in anything but small incremental moments almost never intentionally mostly via sheer unconscious luck. Change is rarely graceful. But if you are indeed anything like me you also spend much of your year mourning the time youve lost at a complete loss of how to use the time you have left and certain that every lowflying plane is going to lose control just long enough to shear the top of your head off and expose your pink little brain to your fellow morning commuters all of whom will take it to the specific group chat that exists purely for laughing about such events. So maybe that means its time to really truly try to change this year. Maybe its time to become an entirely new person in 2023. A new beginning a new chance at living that life thats always been obscured to you. Its a fraught period to enter anyone who says they want to change in the new year comes off as desperate and unmoored anyone who says they dont is a liar and a dog and worse unimaginative. Despite what you hear the fundamentals of utterly changing yourself are fairly simple. Were talking about complete rebirth about as ubiquitous a symbol of human spirituality as you can get and whats the new year but one era dying messily and another springing to life out of its twitching corpse Thats half the work done for you Meanwhile we find ourselves submerged to the neck in the famously nebulous interholiday period. There is no more perfect vessel for change a primordial moment where everything is heavy and time is untrustworthy and the days are alive with bizarre possibilities. Even at a glance the conditions feel like one of those parts of the Bible where things are about to get wild. Every mall is full to capacity with ravenous strangers every movie released is either extraordinary or terrible the department stores are cooking up their own boutique Covid variants the only things left in the Cadbury Favourites box are the freak bars nobody could stomach light seems to bend around the mass of leftover ham still sitting in its weird wet sack in the fridge your Christmas tree has a rare kind of mite your parents dog needs a rare kind of medicine the sky is opening and the dead are walking the Earth once more. You will never be more capable of changing who you are. Your brain has returned to factory settings mode so bored and eager for something new that it has become capable of incredible feats. And from this arcane chaos you will emerge a new creature stark and beautiful shining with ambition and heavy with dreams. Actually working out what that creature looks like Youre on your own there. I cant tell you what you need to be only that it must be completely different to what you once were. Experiment with powerful 3D printers build yourself an industrial exoskeleton out of a mailorder kit and impress your crush by raising and lowering extremely heavy objects in a warehouse setting. Get laser eye surgery whether you need it or not buy a nonfunctional telescope and point it at your neighbours windows to give them something to bond over learn every single wretched dance on TikTok. God just do something. What do you have to lose You are an animal with so much potential and youre here for such a brief moment. The world zooms wildly through space and is showing no signs of losing steam while most of us are so fragile that we need a liedown if were exposed to someone on the train listening to music without headphones. Change may not be graceful but we live in a graceless age. Time to make it happen. Happy new year. I wish you luck. If you need me Ill be somewhere else getting my gyrocopter licence or learning to take a cannonball to the stomach. And if you see me please dont say anything. The person you once knew is gone and the person you see will be a stranger. Plus he probably speaks Esperanto now or something. Jack Vening is a writer living in Melbourne.

I have quite a high girlish voice but I can deepen it for the purposes of sex. I once recorded what I call takehome wanking tapes such as Sexy Sonia Leaves From My Schoolgirl Notebook. They were audio tapes for sale in sex shops. One day I went into Ann Summers and told the man behind the counter I was Sexy Sonia. He told me to keep my voice down because he didnt want people to know Sexy Sonia was actually this short fat rather unattractive lady. But word got out and maybe that prompted my being asked to voice the Cadbury bunny because I suppose sex sells. And chocolate has its place in the repertoire of love. Im a great admirer of your unflinching honesty and sense of fun. What is the naughtiest thing youve ever done toots2000 Everybody has different gradations of naughtiness. I suppose its when I bare my arse or tits at people. When I was younger I enjoyed sharing my body visually. When I was doing The Age of Innocence by the end of a very long day of costume parading the whole crew would be very tired and bored to tears so I thought the only thing to do is to show them my tits. I said Im going to refresh you gentlemen lifted my top and my untrammelled bosoms hung free and dazzling. What are your memories of making the 1980s futuristic musical The Apple 1990s I Love You to Death and 19 85s The Good Father Sakiaba AlisaG215 and carffion23 My memories of The Apple are all hideous. I hated the director Menahem Golan who was a bully. Youre not supposed to talk badly of the dead but Im afraid I cant find anything good to say about him. It was filmed in Berlin which I enjoyed and Joss Ackland is a divine creature. I play a landlady and was winched high into the sky by the German army. I dont know why. Ive never seen the film and dont intend to. I Love You to Death was a very happy experience. Working with Kevin Kline was a joy. Hes a wonderful actor and one of natures gentlemen. He was a big star and I was an absolute nobody playing his mother. When he arrived in Los Angeles he rang me up and said Shall we rehearse our scene I thought what a darling. I worked with some lovely people the director Larry Kasdan a very nice man who invited us all to his Beverly Hills home Joan Plowright Tracey Ullman and River Phoenix and William Hurt who was completely vile. And Im not going to tell you about The Good Father because Im writing about it in my next book. You are superb in everything from Harry Potter to the theatre and all your TV shows. Why did you want to go into acting Gelion Im a showoff. Its as simple as that. I never trained but when I was at school Mummy made me have elocution lessons because she was born in Liverpool and grew up in south London. I cant quite remember my mothers voice which makes me sad but she wanted me to not have a London sound because I was born and brought up in Oxford where the accent is posh Received Pronunciation. I was taught about vowels the secret you have to conquer if you want to move up a class. I dont really rate television as a place to learn acting. You learn acting in the theatre by learning how to use your voice to control an audience. So many television actors you cant understand a word they are saying. They are mumbling. I hope you notice how clear I am even though I feel I need to disguise my ghastly posh voice. I cant bear my own voice because its full of arrogance. I recently celebrated my 70th birthday and am struggling to feel positive about the future. What advice could you give for accepting the passing of the years staying joyful and seizing the day Animus Staying joyful and seizing the day is bloody hard when you are old in pain and feel depressed. Its difficult to face the future when you know theres no light at the end of the tunnel. I dont really have any words of wisdom you just have to get on with it. Everybodys going to die. If youve still got your marbles and youre not incontinent youre fucking lucky. So think of it like that. Whats the filthiest joke you know CthulhusEvilTwin Im certainly not going to tell any filthy jokes. I dont like filthy jokes. People have this idea that Im a walking cesspit. I think its quite unfair. I take great care in the words I use and when I use swear words I mean to use them. I dont like a loose use of filth. I like a precise use of filth. Who are the top five biggest bell ends in the world mesm That is a word I do not know or use. I understand it means idiots or something. The people I loathe most in the world are Vladimir Putin Nigel Farage Boris Johnson David Cameron and Benjamin Netanyahu. How much trouble did you get into for your Jeremy Hunt incident on Radio 4 TheDoctors46Goat I didnt get into trouble except with readers of the Daily Telegraph the Sun the Express and the other unmentionable rags. I gave myself a lot of stick because it was totally unintentional. I did not know that the microphone was on. I was shaking all the way home in the taxi. I was really upset because Radio 4 is a holy temple. What made you want to get involved with the Big Gay Donation that is campaigning to get the 2030 World Cup held in a LGBTQ friendly country nabridnyjtheuncommon Well the funny thing is and it makes me sound like a complete twat I didnt know it was for LGBTQ charity What is your most annoying habit ToyStory123 You would have to ask other people because your own habits you think are rather sweet. I suppose talking about sex so much. But its only because I dont really have sex any more. I just like to remember it and talk about it. I think it would be nice if you mentioned that it was pleasant to talk to me because a lot of people seem to think that Im a hateful old hag and I think thats completely unfair. I think that Im not quite like other people but I do love humanity. I hope Ill be remembered as a talented eccentric a mouthy old bag with a heart of gold.

Especially with the price volatility of sectors like food and grocery where switching brands is an easy inthemoment choice companies cant afford to overlook the importance of sustainability and social responsibility in consumers minds if they want to preserve and build brand loyalty. In the current economic climate social and environmental performance still matters. Brands that want to retain and win customers need to stand for something said Mike Johnston managing director for data products at the research technology firm Glow. Even welloff consumers will be looking for opportunities to trade down to save money. Customers need a compelling reason why they shouldnt swap your brand for a cheaper alternative Johnston added. Along with quality sustainability concerns are likely to be a key factor consumers consider. However great ESG programs with successful positive impacts alone dont translate into profit potential if consumers arent aware of them. Brands must find the right messages and effective methods for delivering their companys ESG stories the ones that click and have staying power with customers. Learning from one brands experience Mondelz International owns Cadbury the maker of chocolate candies sold in more than 40 countries. The brand measures consumer perceptions of its ESG efforts through Glows Social Responsibility Score SRS and related data tools. Cadbury has high brand awareness in general and clear ESG credentials in particular 8 in 10 consumers who are aware of the brand have an opinion about Cadburys sustainability performance according to Glow data. For example Mondelz has had a partnership with Fairtrade since 2009 and developed the sustainable cocoa program Cocoa Life over the past 10 years both with websites dedicated to them. Cadbury products carry onpack messaging to call attention to the Cocoa Life initiative which is designed to support fair trade natural resource sustainability and improved lives for cocoa farmers. This combination of ESG programming and consumer messaging is reaping rewards based on results from Glows SRS tracking. The data tools also retrieve verbatim comments such as praise for Cadburys efforts in environmental sourcing their chocolate from a customer in Sydney illustrating what consumers recognize as positive attributes of the brand. In Australia Cadbury ranked the highest in the snacking subcategory of 14 brands tracked and in the U. K. the third highest in the snacking subcategory. Cadbury saw particularly good progress from August through October of this year raising its SRS in Australia by 13 percent substantially more than the average increase of 3 percent from over 250 brands measured. For that rolling threemonth period Cadbury scored 24 percent above the average of all tracked brands and 15 percent above the average of the score for food and grocery brands. In the U. K. Cadburys position is the same as in Australia where the brand scored 24 percent above all tracked brands and 15percent above the average score for food and grocery brands in the latest time period. Achieving that kind of dominance in consumer perceptions about a companys efforts on fair trade and sustainability is what companies want to see. Yet digging deeper Cadburys SRS rankings reveal new opportunities ripe for further development. Cadburys SRS rating was 94 percent higher among those who recognized even one of the companys ESG initiatives compared to those who had no such awareness. This demonstrates that positivity toward a product can be generated from ESG programs and from effectively delivering quality messages about those initiatives. Still SRS data indicates a significant proportion of consumers were unaware of Cadburys specific ESG programs. If a brand like Cadbury with its high brand awareness and longrunning ESG programs that are heavily communicated is still failing to reach some consumers whats the next step for it or any company to make the connection stick Opportunities in the gaps Consumers say they are gathering their ESG messages primarily through news and media coverage product packaging and advertising said Tim Clover CEO of Glow. But they want to get more information via brandowned channels like packaging and instoreonline at the moment of purchase. The key phrases in Clovers observation of consumer data are more information and moment of purchase. In the U. K. only Montezumas and Tonys Chocolonely are ahead of Cadbury in their ESG ratings as evidenced by the SRS. The Dutch brand Tonys Chocolonely has an unusual way of getting its ESG message across its chocolate bars are segmented in irregular pieces to represent inequalities in chocolate production. Messaging on the inside and outside wrappers further explain the brands quest to eliminate injustice from chocolate manufacturing. The leading brands are using every possible opportunity to communicate how they are making a difference to people and the planet Clover said. Based on the data consumers are telling businesses that their ESG practices matter and so does the way they communicate them. In particular messaging needs to get real and get specific. Brands that grandstand about distant abstract goals can confuse or lose the trust of tunedin and actionfocused consumers even when the programs themselves are highly impactful and beneficial Clover said. The data shows regular updates and communications yield increased engagement from a brands followers and engender trust and loyalty he advised. The bottom line Consumer data drives ESG messaging that stands out If it sounds like consumers want a relationship with companies they do and theyre seeking something that goes beyond a transaction. Business leaders need to treat those relationships the same way as anyone would regard a personal one with communication and trust. As with typical human interactions businesses have to check in with their customers about how the relationship is going. Data and feedback together help companies to identify where the successes are and in what ways they can improve. It may seem like a tall order to give mass outreach a onetoone feeling but the data says thats what consumers want along with a good story delivered when and where they need it for making the best purchasing decisions. Clover captured those expectations with this statement It is clear that consumers dont expect perfection but they do expect commitments honesty and progress. In other words consumers arent just hungry for consumables. Theyre craving a better world and food for thought.

The post Sweet and Salty Chocolate Bark Recipe appeared first on Paleo Leap | Paleo diet Recipes & Tips.",https://paleoleap.com/sweet-salty-chocolate-bark/,Raise your hand if youve ever felt a tiny or notsotiny pang of longing for a Cadbury Fruit and Nut bar. Its OK weve all been there. The chocolate on its own is good but add in the chewy dried fruit and the crunchy nuts and the party is on. Unfortunately Cadbury bars are the kind of cheap chocolate that isnt even a Paleo gray area its just plain unhealthy. If you read the ingredients youll spy sugar in the 1 spot closely followed by soy PGPR whatever that is the mysterious natural and artificial flavor sunflower oil and then even more sugar to round it all off. So Cadbury is out. But you dont have to give up that delicious combination of velvetysmooth chocolate with crunchy nuts and chewy dried fruit. In fact you can make it yourself and make it even better with highquality dark chocolate that doesnt have the sandy consistency of the cheap stuff. And when youre the master chef you can tailor the fruit and nuts to your favorite mix. This recipe kicks up the flavor even more with a sprinkle of sea salt if youve never tried sea salt combined with a sweet flavor youre missing out but if youre not a fan you can just skip that as well. Doing all this yourself doesnt actually take a lot of kitchen knowhow. You dont need a special candy mold or even a thermometer just some basic equipment that you probably already have. So the next time you get candy bar cravings why not round up your favorite sweet and salty ingredients warm up some highquality dark chocolate and take a stab at doing it yourself it tastes better and its a whole lot kinder on your body.

15,Some boxes of Cadbury Milk Tray chocolates are recalled amid complaints they 'taste like bleach',Cadbury's owners say the affected treats include 180g and 360g boxes brought before November 2. It comes after a person in Brighton complained about their 'bleach--like taste.,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11562291/Some-boxes-Cadbury-Milk-Tray-chocolates-recalled-amid-complaints-taste-like-bleach.html,Some boxes of Milk Tray chocolates are withdrawn from sale over food quality issue after customers complained that they taste like bleach Cadburys owners have recalled boxes of Milk Tray brought before November 2 The popular treats now withdrawn are boxes of 180g and 360g chocolates Confectionary bosses have today insisted there is no safety risk to customers It comes after some people complained that the chocolates tasted like bleach Bosses at Cadbury have recalled boxes of Milk Tray chocolates amid claims they taste like bleach. The chocolates a Christmas Day staple for millions of Brits have been withdrawn due to a food quality issue. Cadburys owners say the affected treats include 180g and 360g boxes brought before November 2. It is feared that over time the flavour of the chocolates has been tainted by the cardboard box. However the confectionary firm stressed there was no safety risk. Owners of Cadbury have recalled 180g and 360g boxes of Milk Tray purchased before November 2 after complaints the chocolates tasted like bleach But bosses at Cadburys owners have insisted the chocolates do not pose a risk to safety. Pictured is one of the Milk Tray boxes However it hasnt stopped some festive chocoholics from getting a nasty shock with one person in Brighton saying We had one gifted and the chocolates taste of chemicals. They genuinely taste horrific like bleach. Most people wont open the trays until Christmas which means the majority of people wont notice for at least a week. A slew of onestar reviews on Trustpilot about the taste of Milk Tray have also emerged this month. One reviewer said Just opened a 360g milk tray had one chocolate the taste is like the smell of disinfectant that they use to clean the pig farm with. Another wrote Cadburys milk tray tastes like paint thinner leaves awful chemical metallic after taste. While one angry chocolate lover said The worst bit is the chocolate they are using. It tastes nothing like Cadburys milk chocolate at all. Not only does it not taste like Cadburys it actually tastes really unpleasant and has a metallic taste. If I could rate it as zero stars rather than one I would do so.

16,Aldi adds security tags to 85p packs of sweets,Security tags on low-cost items have become increasingly common as retailers report a rise in shoplifting,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/aldi-adds-security-tags-85p-packs-sweets/,Security tags were once reserved for expensive items such as bottles of booze razor blades and electricals. But now supermarket giant Aldi has added the yellow stickers to packs of sweets worth as little as 85p. Rows of items in the sweets section at Aldis Rushey Green store in Catford south London have been labelled with a yellow security tag which will set off an alarm if stolen. The items include a Kinder Snack Bar priced at 85p Haribo Tangfastics priced at 1 and a pack of five Cadbury Twirls costing 1. 05. A sign warns sweettoothed shoppers that product security tagging is in operation. Security tags on lowcost items have become increasingly common as retailers report a rise in shoplifting and households struggle with rising food prices. Earlier this year Asda added security tags to tubs of spreadable Lurpak in some of its stores after the price of a 1kg tub reached more than 9. Last month security tags were spotted on fourpint containers of milk at a Tesco store in Cornwall although the supermarket insisted it was due to human error. Consumer champion Martyn James warned supermarkets security tagging lowpriced items was extremely worrying. Mr James said Its a complete overreaction to be tagging items of exceptionally small value and gives the completely wrong impression of society that we are going round stuffing our pockets. The increase in shoplifting in recent months has been for necessity because people are struggling to afford to eat. In many cases supermarkets are giving shoplifters a warning but turning a blind eye when it comes to prosecution and that is the human approach. A Telegraph Money investigation earlier this month found shoplifting cases had spiked by 16pc in the past three months as the cost of living drove more thieves to target supermarkets. Figures obtained from more than 20 police forces by a Freedom of Information request found officers were called to 10019 cases in October this year compared to 8602 cases in July. Tesco and Sainsburys were the most popular target for thieves accounting for twofifths of cases overall.

Out of stock at mine after ordering last night. I kept substitutes on so they have to replace it with something of equal or more value. Ended up giving me 12 Cadbury Roses boxes for 12. Not bad because each box is 450g. I just got 5. 4kg of chocolate for 12. Hope OP ended up getting the deal best choc deal of the year its Jan 6. You need to order minimum 12x to get the deal Made in United Kingdom Whats the flavour like. Tea and biscuits 2 cups of English breakfast please Alfred Why not Prince Albert British Briish Chocolate I dont believe you Ive tried Cadbury Dont let that fool you.

Cant buy four of these and a 2 item No max 2x12 I bought cordial which is on a good special. Not gonna go through the same drama as the zero alcohol deal. They handled that terribly to say the least This is version 2. 0 Sounding like Franco 2. 0 pharcyde Talking from experience. Eventually got my 24 pack after fighting with store mamager and getting coles online involved. Was not worth the time spent though. YMMV ivyholmes Initially Gave me 4x6 packs instead of 4x24 packs Ended up with 1x 24 packs and other 3 refunded easternculture Right I modified my order become 24 packs the price showed 24.. lets see how it goes tomorrow easternculture Definitely not worth the time and effort for me then. I just cancelled my order. Happy to hand in the ozbargain hard for this but I dont want to go through that ordeal at all. Just reminded me I was offered a 43 refund credit for my next shop. Just loaded up my cartsure enough no credit to be seen. I do have a 4000 bonus points when you spend 50 at Coles with Flypay sure enough there is no option to use Flypay on the new site. Coles you are the worst Good luck people Edit classic Coles when I added 50. 90 to my cart my Heinegate credit didnt show. But with 52 in the cart the credit did showbut then knocked the 10 off 20 worth of booze down to just 0. 06 cents when the credit is appliedWTF is wrong with this mob doesnt work for me at two coles Get some stupid error loading cart or something Same Im receiving the error below Were having issues loading some product information Trolley item prices and quantities wont be affected My parents account cant add to cart but my own Coles account can Edit prolly bc my parents havent set up a Coles Group profile Umm. that website address once you click log in httpsauth. colesgroupprofile. com. auloginstatehKFo2SBUMn.... This is the legit link when you log in via Coles online httpsshop. coles. com. auagungahlinproductcadburydairy... Look at the domain name of OPs link once you try to sign in Ive never seen that domain before for Coles. Should be shop. coles. com. au.. Anyway just be wary. Log in via a known link just to be sure. I got a couple 30 packs of Coke cans on sale. Gets you over 50. On the shop. coles. com. au link it clearly states 12 boxes for 12. If you go to coles. com. au click account account security edit on my password it takes you to a colesgroupprofile. com. au site. I did set up 2fa and that now also prompts on your shop. coles. com. au site too. So I think youre very right to be paranoid and fortunately its fine in this case. 5. 45 per 100g Are we certain this is 12 boxes and not a 220g box of 12 bars thats the price for the individual item. The red text under it says 12 for 12 or something along those lines. And if you add 12 it does adjust to 12 total Cheers. Yeah I read it as a box of 12 bars. Yeah price per kilo showing 12 for 220g not 12 X 220g. Woolies product page has more details. Approx 8 servings per package 25g per serving approx 2 units Discount in Checkout reflects price of 1box Glitch or no glitch Exactly even if its cancelled or you get it substituted for something else. It still has to be equivalent in value or more. If anything happens just call up customer care always easy to work things out with them for refunds or whatever My order went through. The email gives an estimated total thats in line with the 1 per box price but the price listed per item displays 144 12 x 12. I certainly dont want to pay 12 per box. Not sure what to think. Same not sure Cheers. Just placed an order and will see if they actually have stockIm thinking they wont have enough stock and will cancel Wheres Franco at when chu need him In the penalty box See what happens But according to Coles its supposed to be 2 for 12. And yet you did not share this deal with fellow ozbargainers Yet to post a single deal. Smh. Well he did say his wife ordered it. Who knows when he knew about it. Ill give him the benefit of the doubt that when he was gona post the deal it was already done by Sydneyswans.. lol Im quite sure short dated. I believe best before Feb or march. But good sugar loading all the same I just picked my order up. Expiry is Sept 2023. 9 months is a good amount of time. Dont click on the link go to the coles app and select click and collect for your local search the name add 12 and check your cart it will say save 132 But still has the item summary of 144 though at the end its only 12 Best before 0923 Ordered 24 for pickup tomorrow night. Well see if its honored. It does say 5. 45 per 100g in the description I think its a great deal if delivered as described but Im guessing it will end with many people returning the 220g box. As I stated in an answer to another person saying this That price per 100g is for one item. There is red text that says 12 for 12 and if you add 12 to cart it is 12. Ordered just then will also see if the 12 is available to honour. Update picked up today. A lot of chocolate lol After I picked up the items I got a text message 5 hours later saying it was an error and they are unable to honour lol Ordered 5. Lets see what happens. Thanks OP. modify your order to 12 or when you pick it up youre going to be saying wtf is this 5 would cost 60. If you slowly add the cost will go up. But once you add 12 it goes back to 12 Thanks all. Updated to 12. Also grabbed a couple of organic chickens that we usually get to make it 57 in total. Addd 12 to cart Oh yeah my bad. I swear the people on here used to be smarter. And it used to be a lot easier to gift wrap them a bargain than it is nowadays. kiriakoz Because people comment without checking themselves the days of people thinking they know everything and not being able to comprehend anything. Willy Beamish That sounds about right but its so stupid. I read the comments because you get so much extra information whether it worked for other people if the same item is even cheaper somewhere else some other tipstricks. If youre not reading the comments youre missing a trick. I just love how confident this one is about it. A guy sees what looks like a great deal a box of choccies for a buck each if you buy 12 and its like he stabbed someone in the eye with scissors the amount of carry on So true I have had a few posts with similar things it seems its easier to ask than do your own research Rolled the dice on 24 and ended up receiving 2 My Coles account has been deactivated and Im being told to contact customer support to get it reactivated.. Just my luck. Same here dont know whats up with that. My order was cancelled,"

18,I'm Buying These 3 Resilient Stocks During a Bear Market,These businesses should enjoy continued demand for their products through an economic downturn.,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/12/30/im-buying-3-resilient-stocks-during-a-bear-market/,In a bull market its common for investors to chase growth stocks for attractive capital gains. However the market has reversed sharply this year and plunged both the technologyheavy Nasdaq Composite index and bellwether SP 500 into a punishing bear market. In a sharp U turn investors are now refocusing their attention on resilience and stability as the bear market drags on. Some qualities investors should watch for are companies with a portfolio of strong brands a sturdy franchise and a long track record of paying out dividends. Possessing these attributes means the company can navigate through tough economic times while doling out a steady stream of passive income. Food and beverage businesses as well as industrial companies are back in the spotlight as they exhibit such traits and should be able to keep your capital safe in a new era of high inflation and surging interest rates. Here is a list of three resilient stocks that you can consider adding to your portfolio. Mondelez International You may not realize it but the cookies and snacks you pop into your mouth may just belong to one of the brands of Mondelez International MDLZ 0. 45. Mondelez owns such famous snack names as Oreo Cadbury Milka Ritz and Toblerone and markets its products in more than 150 countries. Its stable of popular brands has proven resilient during the pandemic allowing the snack company to post an unbroken rise in revenue from 2019 to 2021. Net revenue increased from 25. 9 billion to 28. 7 billion over this period while net income went from 3. 9 billion to 4. 3 billion. Aside from seeing its profits rise Mondelez also generates copious amounts of free cash flow to the tune of around 3 billion per year. For the first nine months of 2022 the company continued to post topline growth with revenue rising 8. 3 year over year to 22. 8 billion. Inflation and a sharp rise in expenses however have crimped Mondelezs net income for the period causing it to fall from 3. 3 billion to 2. 1 billion. Despite this free cash flow remained strong for the first nine months of the year at 1. 9 billion allowing the company to keep raising its dividend a trend its maintained since 2013. In times to come Mondelez should be able to raise its prices to offset the effects of inflation as it commands strong brand loyalty allowing the company to continue to post healthy top and bottomline growth. PepsiCo PepsiCo PEP 0. 31 is another food and beverage company with a stable of wellknown brands. The company sells its signature PepsiCola along with beverage brands such as Mountain Dew and Gatorade as well as snacks such as Doritos Lays potato chips and Quaker Oats. PepsiCos financial numbers attest to how strong its franchise is today. Revenue climbed from 67. 2 billion in 2019 to 79. 5 billion in 2021. Net income saw a slight dip from 7. 3 billion to 7. 1 billion from 2019 to 2020 but 2021s net income of 7. 6 billion surpassed both years. Free cash flow steadily climbed from 5. 4 billion to 7 billion from 2019 to 2021 averaging around 6. 2 billion per year. PepsiCos strong free cash flow generation has enabled the food and beverage giant to raise its dividends for 50 consecutive years putting it firmly in the ranks of Dividend Kings. The company has continued posting strong numbers for the first nine months of 2022 with revenue rising by 7. 7 year over year to 58. 4 billion. Net income after adjusting for exceptional items climbed 6 year over year to 6. 7 billion. Free cash flow remained strong at 3. 8 billion for the period giving investors confidence that PepsiCo can continue to raise its dividends and weather an economic storm. Inflation is unlikely to be a problem for the company as PepsiCo has successfully passed on price increases to its customers. Dover Corporation Dover Corporation DOV 1. 04 may not be a household name but the global manufacturer of industrial products from pumps and clamps to printing systems and car wash equipment has been a rocksolid stalwart all these years. Dover is firmly on the Dividend Kings list with 67 consecutive years of increasing its dividend an impressive record by any measure. The industrial giant posted steady revenue growth from 7. 1 billion in 2019 to 7. 9 billion in 2021 with net earnings surging from 678 million to 1. 12 billion over the same period. Even after adjusting for a oneoff gain for 2021 net income still rose more than 35 to 917. 5 million. Dover also generated an average of 880 million of free cash flow per year over these three years. The company has demonstrated its resilience by reporting a robust set of earnings for the first nine months of the year. Revenue was up 7. 6 year over year to 6. 4 billion while net income rose 5. 4 year over year to 801. 8 million. Dover continued to churn out free cash flow of 301 million for the first nine months of 2022 giving investors confidence that it can continue to raise its dividends.

The supermarket giants both started filling their bakery shelves with hot cross buns on Boxing Day much to the surprise of many customers because Easter is more than three months away. Woolies released its Cadbury hot cross buns for 5 for a pack of four with the rest of the range being released in the near future while Coles are selling up to 12 buns for 6. Our teams across the country are baking up a storm to bring Aussies the best innovation quality and value that Woolworths has to offer this Easter a spokesperson for Woolworths said in a statement. Supermarket giants Woolworths and Coles have come under fire after they released hot cross buns to stores nationwide with Easter three months away pictured Coles hot cross buns The decision to sell the buns so early comes after a hugely successful launch of the product at a similar date last year with Woolworths hoping to replicate the the number of sales. We sold more than 1. 8million individual hot cross buns the first week they were on sale last year and we anticipate the same as customers look to close off 2022 the spokesperson said. Given the feedback from customers last Easter we are confident these decadent buns will be popular once again. However many shoppers took to social media to pile onto the early release of the buns from both stores questioning the social norms of eating the baked good months before Easter. Are you kidding me this must be a pss take Take hot cross buns and shove it until Good Friday one social media user wrote in response to Woolworths.

22,Mondelez Stock: Gum Business Sale is Bullish - TipRanks,Mondelez (NASDAQ: MDLZ) could be the value-and-yield hidden gem you’ve been looking for. I am bullish on Mondelez stock because the company’s management has the wis...,https://www.tipranks.com/news/article/mondelez-stock-gum-business-sale-is-bullish,Mondelez NASDAQ MDLZ could be the valueandyield hidden gem youve been looking for. I am bullish on Mondelez stock because the companys management has the wisdom to know when to divest underperforming business units. Sometimes a company has to slim down in order to focus on more highconviction areas and thats exactly what Mondelez is doing. Chicagobased Mondelez sells snack food and beverage products in multiple countries. Believe it or not Mondelezs foothold in the candy and chewing gum markets spans over 150 countries throughout the world. Consumer defensive stocks have generally outperformed hypergrowth names in 2022. Yet this doesnt mean Mondelez hasnt had its fair share of challenges. A rocky global economy has forced the company to reevaluate certain business divisions. Mondelez wisely turned a problem into an opportunity however and thats a great sign for this sometimesoverlooked company. Mondelez Offers Value Yield and Brand Recognition If youre concerned about the possibility of a recession in 2023 then you might want to take shelter in brandbased consumer stocks. You might not immediately recognize the Mondelez name but the companys products will likely be familiar. Besides there are features of Mondelez and its stock that sensible investors ought to appreciate. Heres some food for thought. Mondelez might not be a household name in the U. S. but chances are excellent that youve heard of Oreo cookies Cadbury and Toblerone chocolates Sour Patch Kids candy and Trident chewing gum. These famous brands have been around for decades and arent going away anytime soon. Plus heres something for financial traders to chew on Mondelez offers a healthy 2. 18 annual dividend yield and the companys PE ratio of 29. 7x isnt outlandishly high. This isnt to suggest that MDLZ stock would fly high during a recession but it might not decline as much as stocks with lofty valuations. Furthermore Mondelezs management is preparing to expand the companys business model not only into candy and chewing gum but other areas as well. To that end the companys Vision 2030 strategy aims to generate 90 of revenue in chocolate and biscuits including baked snacks. Mondelez views these product categories as having significant growth opportunities for the future. Mondelez to Divest Its Underperforming Gum Business Mondelez offers a decent dividend and strong shareholder value but that doesnt mean the company has been 100 successful in all endeavors. The companys management clearly knows when to trim its operations as Mondelez just announced an agreement to divest part of its global gummanufacturing business. Specifically Mondelez will sell its developedmarket gum business meaning its gummanufacturing operations in the U. S. Canada and Europe to European gum and confectionery maker Perfetti Van Melle Group. This sale fits with Mondelezs portfolio reshaping strategy also known as Vision 2030 as the company seeks to focus on its core markets chocolate biscuits and baked snacks. Perfetti the maker of Mentos candy seems perfectly happy to acquire Mondelezs developedmarket gum brands. Perfetti Van Melle will be an excellent home for the management team and employees of Mondelzs gum business in North America and Europe explained the companys chairman Egidio Perfetti. Meanwhile Mondelezs management is undoubtedly pleased with the deal as the company stands to gain 1. 35 billion from it. Even beyond this massive cash infusion Morningstar analyst Erin Lash is bullish on Mondelezs deal with Perfetti as parting ways with a business that has fallen out of favor with consumers should be an advantageous undertaking. I agree wholeheartedly as it makes sense for Mondelez to focus on core business divisions that feature annual sales growing by midsingledigit percentages outpacing the lowsingledigit marks that tend to characterize packaged food more broadly. Its a step in the right direction as Mondelez embarks boldly on its Vision 2030 strategy while securing 1. 35 billion to help the company achieve its longterm objectives. Is MDLZ Stock a Buy Sell or Hold Turning to Wall Street MDLZ has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The average Mondelez price target is 71. 54 implying 7. 72 upside potential. Conclusion Should You Consider Mondelez Stock Value hunters and income seekers should seriously consider a long position in MDLZ stock today. Its also encouraging to know that analysts are generally bullish on the stock. Ultimately only time will tell whether Mondelez will be successful in its Vision 2030 strategy. The companys off to a great start with the Perfetti deal however and cautious investors can brace for a potentially volatile 2023 with a reasonably safe position in Mondelez stock.,"Hot cross buns stocked at Woolworths, Coles on Boxing Day as internet erupts",Extremely Positive,170,"['decadent', 'greedy', 'complains']","['fire', 'fire', 'fire']",[]

25,Cadbury’s subtle new spot focuses on generosity,The low-key ad is the latest from the brand to use gentle storytelling to continue its message of how its Dairy Milk bars spread joy,https://www.creativereview.co.uk/cadburys-ad-garage-vccp/,Cadburys subtle new spot focuses on generosity The lowkey ad is the latest from the brand to use gentle storytelling to continue its message of how its Dairy Milk bars spread joy Created by VCCP London the new film for Dairy Milk focuses on an exchange between a father and daughter. Set in a garage where the daughter is doing the nightshift and her dad is filling up his car the spot uses few words to express a loving if seemingly slightly complex relationship. We might be a long way away from the madcap Dairy Milk days of the drumming gorilla but the pivot here is still that the chocolate bar is a simple piece of joy that can be used to spread happiness. Shot by director Steve Rogers the ad is in a similar vein to other recent ads for Dairy Milk including Mums Birthday and Fence which all tell stories of how small acts of kindness can go a long way. This strategy seems all the more relevant in todays turbulent times. Weve always said generosity is out there in the world it just doesnt shout as loudly as the negative stuff say Jonny Parker and Chris Birch VCCP ECDs.

Everybody I speak to says this is by far the best McDonalds in the world British chef Gareth Ward said of the fastfood chains twoyearold Welshpool Wales branch. The branch located at Enterprise Park in Buttington Cross may even be the secondbest restaurant in the country only after Wards awardwinning Ynyshir. In addition to serving McDonalds signature Big Macs the Welshpool franchise also features sandwiches with trufflefragrant mayonnaise and Cadbury chocolatefilled soft serve the New York Post reported. Im telling you now Welshpool McDonalds is on a different level. Its just got different elements to everyone else. Its just absolutely smashing it Ward the head chef and coowner of Ynyshir which has been awarded two Michelin stars said. Welshpool McDonalds thats what its all about he told WalesOnline. The branch that opened in May of 2021 has also received praise from people online. This one is different said one reviewer who claimed the restaurants staff members were polite the service quick and the food fresh. McDonalds Denmark offered a highend burger in 2021 that ended up selling out in a few weeks due to its overwhelming popularity. The Homestyle Bearnaise a creation of English chef Paul Cunningham whose two restaurants each received Michelin stars consisted of a beef patty layered with Barnaise sauce potato sticks smoked onion puree roasted onions lettuce and cheddar cheese served atop a brioche bun. Cunninghams collaboration with McDonalds drew controversy in culinary circles with acclaimed Denmarkbased chef Christian Puglisi calling it a betrayal of values. You cannot participate in symposiums you cannot talk about quality produce you cannot discuss and try to communicate cooking culture traditional dishes and homey cooking on one hand and on the other hand be an advocate for the worst garbage that is produced and called food at the same time Puglisi said in a 9minute video he uploaded on his Instagram account in February 2021. McDonalds is no good. It is common knowledge to all of us that what they do is unhealthy its hollowing out any kind of cooking culture and it is a fastfood chain that is spending millions of dollars to lure in children with plastic toys to sell them garbage he added.

Nestled on the shelf between springtime staples Reeses Peanut Butter Eggs and Cadbury Creme Eggs these new MMs consist of marshmallowflavored white chocolate and a crisped rice center. Although Mars previously released White Chocolate Marshmallow MMs in 2019 I was intrigued by the product and wondered Could White Chocolate Marshmallow Crispy Treat MMs be the perfect springtime treat If spring is the season of rebirth and renewal fruit and floral flavors should step aside. Marshmallows deserve the springtime crown. After all crispy cereal treats promise a second life to those stale marshmallows that never made it into your cocoa mug this winter. Still very much in the depths of winter I look forward to renewing my pantry long before the first day of spring arrives. Eager to test my theory and the product I bought a Share Size package and was struck by the candys beautiful pastel color palette of yellow blue coral and pink. Generally small and pebblelike these MMs are smaller than the standard plain variety comparable in size to the recent Milk Chocolate Honey Graham flavor. However these MMs vary widely in size and shape. This variance coupled with the candys lovely colors reminds me of colorful aquarium gravel aka Forbidden Fruity Pebbles in the best possible way. The small bites proved to be a great choice because the crispy center core added satisfying texture and balance to the white chocolates sweetness. The texture definitely enhances the candy and is a perfect representation of a crispy cereal treat. Even though the texture suggests crispy cereal treat so strongly the marshmallow flavor underwhelms. Its subtle and hard to recreate. This attempt reminds me of marshmallow fondant sugary with a hint of artificial vanilla. The taste is definitely not bad as evidenced by how easily I downed half a bag. The flavor just reminds me more of white chocolate with a memory of marshmallow than actual marshmallow. This next detail didnt factor into my rating but I felt the need to share. Because the candies are irregularlyshaped some of the Ms do not appear fully on every shell. At first I thought the partial Ms were intended as other letters spelling out a springthemed message. For someone who loves words I am terrible at Scrabble especially when the only letters at my disposal are M N U and I. Plus that sideways M that looks like an E. U MINE Yikes. Overall the crispy texture of White Chocolate Marshmallow Crispy MMs offers an improvement upon the 2019 White Chocolate Marshmallow variety. I liked them less than other white chocolate offerings especially the Key Lime Pie flavor. Maybe fruit flavors should keep the springtime flavor crown but marshmallow should be assured that there is no shame in second place.
