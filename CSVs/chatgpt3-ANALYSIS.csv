Microsoft is betting on the rising popularity of ChatGPT3 as it showcases a new way to search the internet and responding to queries using conversational language different from what Google offers currently in the way of links Bloomberg cited a company source as saying. Google commands more than 91 market share in the internet search category globally compared to Bings 2. 95 as of November 2022 according to data from similarweb. com. The source cited by Bloomberg also said that Microsoft was evaluating the accuracy of the ChatGPT3 AI engine and was working on understanding how soon it could be integrated with Bing but warned that it could take several months before the chatbot engine is integrated into Bing and is released to the public. The Information report claims that Bings March 2023 release could include the chatbot engine integration going live. An email sent to Microsoft and OpenAI didnt immediately elicit a response. The addition of the new AI engine would not be Microsofts first effort to integrate of an OpenAI tool with Bing. In October 2022 Microsoft in a blog post said that it was looking to integrate the image generation software engine DALLE 2 into the image creator inside Bing. Both the planned integrations can be traced back to Microsofts 1 billion investment in OpenAI in 2019 to expedite efforts to further artificial general intelligence for widely distributed economic benefits. Artificial general intelligence is a term applied to AI systems that can learn to perform any intellectual task a person can and communicate in natural language the way a person can as opposed to systems that are trained to do specific tasks. Were partnering to develop a hardware and software platform within Microsoft Azure which will scale to AGI artificial general intelligence. Well jointly develop new Azure AI supercomputing technologies according to a joint statement. In addition to integrating new AI features into Bing Microsofts renewed efforts to grab market share from Google especially on the mobile side include plans for a new super app for mobile phones that will combine shopping messaging web search and newsfeeds according to a separate report from The Information.,2023-01-04T14:11:00Z,ChatGPT3 — Let The Generative AI Revolution Begin,Extremely Positive,180,"['Jeopardy', 'Jeopardy', 'biased', 'incorrect', 'issue', 'disrupt', 'disrupt', 'disrupt', 'issues']",['disease'],['harassment']
2,AI To Go Mainstream In 2023,"Spillover impact of AI tools like Dall-E and ChatGPT could be important and far-reaching. Expect to see much more focus on AI-related capabilities in products, software and services in 2023.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4568259-artificial-intelligence-mainstream-2023,AI To Go Mainstream In 2023 Summary In 2023 both consumers and businesses should expect to see many very blatant examples of AIpowered capabilities in their daytoday activities. As with many technologies that essentially hide in plain sight before theyre widely understood and appreciated these mainstream AI capabilities will open peoples eyes to the many other types of AIpowered functions that currently exist and continue to be improved. In addition the need to have devices that can help accelerate AIpowered software functions will be recognized as becoming essential. One of the many challenges in analyzing and predicting trends in the tech industry is that some topics get so much coverage well before theyre ready that by the time they start to really impact the market they sound like old news. Artificial Intelligence AI is a great example of this phenomenon. The tech industry and even general press has been discussing the concept and early implementations of AI for a long time but realworld examples have been relatively hard to find. To be clear AIpowered functions have been in use for several years in things like computational photography algorithms on smart phones as well as highend cloudbased data analytics applications. However many of these applications are essentially invisible to most people. This year however both consumers and businesses should expect to see many very blatant examples of AIpowered capabilities in their daytoday activities. The launch and huge splash made by the DallE image generating tool and others like it and the ChatGPT3 autonomous chatbot at the end of last year started hinting at where things were going. I expect to see significantly more highprofile examples like these this year as well. To put it succinctly while its been predicted many times before I expect 2023 to be the year where AI finally goes mainstream. Whats fascinating about both DallE and ChatGPT is that they are examples of whats referred to as generative AI or the ability to create original contentinformation even software code from a very limited input. With DallE for example you can ask it to generate images in various styles from a simple text description of things you want included. Draw a red Porsche driving through Northern California wine country during a snowstorm in a pointillist style for example. In the case of ChatGPT3 the capabilities are even more extensive. You can for example ask it to create original song lyrics or a bedtime story or even a college essay a huge new concern for educators worried about cheating on whatever topic and in whatever style you request. Imagine for example the ability to immediately generate an article describing how OLED TVs work in the stream of consciousness style of author James Joyce that incorporates characters from the Harry Potter book series. None of the generative AI tools are perfect and many of their more egregious flaws are starting to be documented. However they are both good enough in fact astonishing in many ways that they can provide a much clearer view of whats possible with AI to almost anyone. Plus as with most technologies new improved versions area already in the works ChatGPT4 and enhanced versions of other tools are expected to appear this year. The other interesting thing about these types of tools is that their application goes well beyond their primary functions. It turns out one of the more interesting applications for a tool like ChatGPT3 for example could be a complete rethinking of search engines. In order to enable its incredible creative power the software algorithm powering ChatGPT3 was fed most all of the textbased information available on the internet and then trained to build links across all this information. Current search engines are good at finding the information related to a request but not good at combining it all together in a way that makes sense to normal human beings. So instead of having to individually check out different links when doing a search on a topic imagine being provided with a summary of the most relevant information. That type of AIpowered search takes it to an entirely other level. Recognizing this Microsoft MSFT is rumored to be bringing some of the ChatGPT functionality to an updated version of its Bing search engine as early as March. Microsoft is a significant financial contributor to OpenAI the company that developed ChatGPT and DallE. In addition red flags have apparently been raised at Google GOOG GOOGL about the potential impact of these types of tools so many are expecting a combination of the companys own LaMDA MUM and PaLM generative language models to be incorporated into a future version of Google Search. The significance of AI applications becoming commonplace and impactful for a large percentage of the population goes well beyond the abilities themselves however. As with many technologies that essentially hide in plain sight before theyre widely understood and appreciated these mainstream AI capabilities will open peoples eyes to the many other types of AIpowered functions that currently exist and continue to be improved. Everything from the ability to automatically generate photorealistic background images from simple sketch drawings as Nvidia NVDA is doing with their Canvas tool part of their larger Omniverse creative platform to the ability to improve 5G signal reception in smartphones through modems that learn how to adapt to the signals in a given region as Qualcomm QCOM is doing with their X70 chips AIpowered background tasks are going to start getting more recognition and appreciation this year. In addition the need to have devices that can help accelerate AIpowered software functions will be recognized as becoming essential. At this years CES for example Intel INTC and AMD AMD demonstrated new hardware acceleration capabilities for AIbased software in their latest PC processors. Intel is incorporating technology from their Movidius line of AI accelerators into certain versions of their latest 13 th Gen Intel core processors and AMD unveiled a whole new AI architecture for some of their newly announced Ryzen 7000 processors. Dubbed Ryzen AI and featured in the new Ryzen 7040 line the technology incorporates a dedicated AI engine designed to speed up AIrelated applications. Both the Intel and AMD efforts are akin to the early days of integrating GPU graphics engine into their CPUs. Expect many more developments on this front in the PC world because of this. The bottom line is the spillover impact of mainstream AI tools like DallE and ChatGPT is likely to be as important and probably even more farreaching than they are. As a result expect to see a great deal more focus on AIrelated capabilities in products software and services of all types throughout the new year.
