7,War of billboards: How new year promo ads turned political,"It all started with unusual and funny commercial advertisements by three brands to celebrate the new year. However, it soon assumed political overtones and became a slugfest between three prominent parties.",2023-01-11T07:13:13Z,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/war-of-billboards-how-new-year-promo-ads-turned-political/articleshow/96904533.cms,NEW DELHI It all started with unusual and funny commercial advertisements by three brands to celebrate the new year. However it soon assumed political overtones and became a slugfest between three prominent parties. Indian online shopping company Blinkit Indian food delivery company Zomato and American ondemand overthetop OTT video streaming service company Netflix tagged each other on social media to promote their products on the new year. Blinkits post on Twitter said New year new billboard. Doodh mangoge doodh denge Ask for milk will provide milk. With the caption New collab collaboration Zomato added its own slogan to that of Blinkit and said Kheer mangoge kheer denge Ask for sweet rice pudding we will deliver sweet rice pudding. On its part Netflixs post included billboards also of Blinkit and Zomato besides its own. With the caption Its a great day to go out and look at billboards it said Friday mangoge Wednesday denge Ask for Friday will provide Wednesday. Wednesday is a currently streaming popular English TV serial by Tim Burton starring Jenna Ortega Gwendoline Christie and Riki Lindhome among others. Basically all these slogans from Blinkit Zomato and Netflix are adaptations from a popular dialogue Tum doodh mangoge hum kheer denge tum Kashmir mangoge hum cheer denge You ask for milk and we will give you sweet rice pudding. But if you demand Kashmir we will tear you apart. Delivered by an Indian to a Pakistani the dialogue is from the 2002 Bollywood film Maa Tujhe Salaam starring Sunny Deol Arbaaz Khan and Tabu among others. Blinkit replied to the viewers of Netflix shows saying Binge watch karoge popcorn hum la denge If you watch several episodes of a show in succession we will get you popcorn. In a wordplay Netflix said Recommended for us Hum Aapke Hain Corn. To this Zomato responded by saying Yup its a Wednesday after all. Most of the tweets were being exchanged on January 4 which was a Wednesday. Travel agency company Yatra pitched in and with the hashtag Book now pay later said Hotels mangoge Re 1 mein denge Ask for hotels we will provide for Re 1. Food and beverage company Kulhad Biryani which calls itself Indias first jhatka biryani brand used the original dialogue from the film as a slogan to say Kashmir mangoge cheer denge. Ad war turns political Subsequently the ad war which was funny till then turned political. The Congress and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwalled Aam Aadmi Party AAP attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP using the promos as their template. The BJP responded but belatedly and feebly. Congress The youth wing of the opposition Congress Indian Youth Congress IYC posted more than half a dozen slogans to hit out at the Narendra Modi government at the Centre. The party in a reference to BJPs alleged Operation Lotus in states such as Karnataka Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra said Jahaan sarkar nahin banehi wahaan vidhayak khareed lenge Will buy MLAs in states where we fail to form government. IYC posted a tweet with two slogans which said Jobs mangoge jumla denge If ask for jobs we will give you rhetorics and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharamans old statement rupee weak nahi hua hai dollar strong hai The rupee has not weakened but the dollar has strengthened. Referring to the defence ministrys Agniveer scheme of employment which had caused unrest and violence in some parts of the country last year IYC said Sena me bharti mangoge Agniveer denge You ask for recruitment in the defence forces we will give you Agniveer. IYC demanded that those who conceived the Agniveer scheme should also be retired. Another tweet from IYC said Freedom of speech mangoge UAPA The Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment Act denge You demand freedom of speech we will give you UAPA. In a dig at Modi who has not held any structured press conference ever since he became PM in 2014 IYC said Press conference mangoge to scripted interview denge If you demand a press conference we will give you scripted interview. IYC also referred to the ongoing Bharat Jodo Yatra led by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi. Captioned down to hate hail the love it said Tum desh todoge hum Bharat jodenge You break the country we will unite it. In cited Rahuls statement and said Nafrat ke bazaar me mohabbat ki dukan khol raha hu mai I am opening a shop of love in a market full of hatred In yet another tweet IYC said Agar sarkar par sawal uthaoge antinational declare denge If you raise questions at the government we will declare you antinational. Another billboard said BJP join karoge toh clean chit denge If you join the BJP we will give you a clean chit. Finally a tweet attacked the alleged privatisation moves of the Centre and said Vikas mangoge rashtriya sampatti bech denge If you demand development we will sell the national properties. AAP AAP which is in power in Delhi and Punjab also lashed out at the BJP through the ad war. It said We found another billboard. Doodh kheer ya maango tea sabme laga diya GST Ask for milk sweet rice pudding or tea we have imposed GST on all of them. BJP In response to more than half a dozen tweets from the Congress and AAP the Bihar unit of the BJP posted just one tweet. It was a censure of the recent lathicharge in Patna on students who were protesting on January 4 the leak of Bihar Staff Selection Commission BSSC papers. Several aspirants were injured in the police action. The BJP had condemned the JDURJDCongresss Mahagathbandhan coalition government and called it the state governments brutality on students. The BJP Bihar tweet said Rozgar mangoge lathiyon se peet denge If you demand jobs we will beat you with sticks. Meanwhile in a similar kind of promo ads but this time on the new year eve Indian food delivery company Swiggy and condom manufacturers Durex also posted humourous and unconventional tweets. Swiggy posted a tweet saying 2757 packets of DurexIndia condoms delivered by SwiggyInstamart so far. Please order 4212 more to make it 6969 so we can all say nice. Durex India replied to Swiggy and said Thank you for delivering them Os. We know at least 2757 are having a banging new year. P. S We hope they order coffee together tomorrow morning. In a quirky retort Swiggy Instamart said durexindia the people who ordered these 2757 condoms are probably not reading this rn right now.
8,"Kotak sees lower GMV for Zomato in short term, cuts target price to Rs 85",Kotak has cut its target price to Rs 85 a share from Rs 100 a share earlier targeted. The target still suggests a 45 per cent potential upside from Wednesday#39;s tradiong price of Rs 59.20 apiece.,2022-12-28T05:55:18Z,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/kotak-sees-lower-gmv-for-zomato-in-short-term-cuts-target-price-to-rs-85-9774991.html,Predicting a subdued gross merchandise value GMV in the near term amid weaker demand brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities has cut the target price on the shares of Zomato Ltd. Kotak has cut its target price to Rs 85 a share from Rs 100 earlier targeted. The target still suggests a 45 percent potential upside from Wednesdays trading price of Rs 59. 20 apiece. Our conversations with industry participants indicate that food delivery GMV growth may remain subdued in the nearterm owing to weak demand. As a result we trim GMV growth forecasts for Zomatos food delivery segment. We like Zomatos comfortable market share position in a duopolistic market and believe the Indian delivery market has legs to grow nearterm slowdown notwithstanding Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to investors. After Zomato posted a 35 percent yearonyear food delivery GMV growth in the first half of FY23 the brokerage firm anticipates it to decelerate to 21 percent onyear in the second half of FY23. Although AOVs are likely to hold up due to inflation and relatively higher delivery charges slower growth in orders will lead to slower GMV growth Kotak said. This in turn is owing to weak consumer demand in what otherwise is a seasonally strong quarter for outdoor food consumption. We reckon the weakness is panIndia with a slowdown in demand in metro and nonmetro geographies. The fact that restaurant chains are also witnessing a slowdown indicates the slowdown is across channels and delivery is not necessarily losing share to instore dining Kotak said in a report. According to a Jefferies note on December 19 the brokerage firm has removed Zomato from its India Model Portfolio because it wanted to add weight to the metals sector with China reopening and the expectation of peaking of interest rates in the US. For the tactical move exiting Zomato we are incrementally wary of a potential rise in competitive activity in the sector As its chief competitor Swiggy has recently seen market share loss wrote Jeffereys Mahesh Nandurkar and Abhinav Sinha in the report.
9,7 of the Most Interesting Travel Tech Startups Raising Capital in 2022,"Seven interesting travel tech startups that raised money in 2022: Deal Engine, Gordian, Hopper, Mews, Rapido, ResortPass, and TravelPerk.",2022-12-23T06:30:00Z,https://skift.com/2022/12/23/7-of-the-most-interesting-travel-tech-startups-raising-capital-in-2022/,Skift Take Despite an increasingly negative economic forecast travel tech startups raised billions of dollars in 2022. Travel Startup Funding This Week Each week we round up travel startups that have recently received or announced funding. Please email Travel Tech Reporter Justin Dawes at email protected if you have funding news. Skift kept an eye through much of 2022 on which travel tech startups raised money documented in this weekly startup funding roundup. Anything related to shortterm rentals got the most frequent funding but there was a wide variety of other startups that raise venture capital throughout the year despite a declining economic forecast. Below is an outline of some of the most interesting travel tech startups in alphabetical order that received funding in 2022. Deal Engine raised 5. 3 million not a lot compared to some of the others in this list but the Miamibased startup is tackling a problem thats a notorious headache for airlines and their customers postbooking flight changes. Historically airlines contract expensive call centers to deal with many of the change requests by customers an issue that became unbearable during the pandemic. Volaris told Skift that it starts the process with software by Sabre but that only covers about half of the issues and the rest historically were transferred to call centers. With the supplemental Deal Engine software fewer than 10 percent of postbooking calls have to be sent to a call center now. Gordian a Y Combinator grad raised 25 million to help airlines with upselling. The tech is used to help push travelers buying airline tickets into paying for extras like seating assignments and checked baggage. Because airlines often werent getting any upsells in online channels because the agencies werent offering them any gain is flowing directly to their bottom line. As a result ordinarily bureaucratic carriers found ways to prioritize the integration. Gordian in July reported it had more than 100 online travel companies and sites as customers. It also said at that time that it was operating at 15 times its 2019 revenue. Hopper added 96 million to an investment from Capital One and announced a longterm partnership with the bank. The online travel agency has raised a total of 730 million. Hopper powers Capital One Travel and Hopper also offers an array of fintech products such as price freezes on flights and hotels for an array of other partners. Hopper has said that much of its revenue comes from its unique fintech products. Hopper claims to be the third largest online travel agency in North America commanding 11. 2 percent of thirdparty flight bookings in the U. S. citing Marketing Information Data Tapes figures. Mews a U. K. based hotel tech startup raised 185 million led by Kinnevik and Goldman Sachs. It was a number high above typical venture capital fundraises in that industry especially impressive during the economic uncertainty thats causing venture capital firms to hold onto money a bit tighter. Mews offers a wide variety of cloudbased solutions for hotels including property management guest management and a new payments system all designed on an open system that allows hotels to connect the products with others they may use. The company plans to focus more on the midmarket segment and expand geographically. Mews also plans to continue acquiring other hotel tech companies. Rapido a taxi service that uses motorbikes instead of cars raised 180 million. The company operates in 100 cities across India. Investors included Swiggy an Indian online food ordering and delivery platform. The platform in April reported having 450000 monthly active drivers and a total of more than 300 million orders. ResortPass raised 26 million from investors including celebrities Jessica Alba and Gwyneth Paltrow for a platform that can help hotels access an entirely new revenue stream. The ResortPass customer software platform can market availability of a hotels amenities spas pools fitness centers meeting rooms and more and allow guests to use them during the day without needing to book an overnight stay. The company also offers hotel clients a software platform to manage that business on the backend. The startup partners with more than 900 hotels including brands like Ritz Carlton Four Seasons Westin Fairmont W Hotels and Hyatt Hotels. Before the pandemic the startup had about 100 hotel partners. TravelPerk a Barcelonabased travel management agency focused on business travelers raised 115 million. Founded by a Booking. com veteran the startups board also includes Gillian Tans former chair and CEO of the online travel agency giant. TravePerk said it offers an allinone platform for business travelers from booking to trip management. The agency is focusing on offering more sustainable travel options and its also enhancing an events tool to help connect remote and hybrid teams. Bonuses Kyte raised 60 million in venture capital as well as 200 million in assetbacked credit financing from Goldman Sachs and Ares Global Management for an ondemand car rental service that includes doorstep delivery. Volantio an optimization startup focused on airlines raised 6 million from firms like DiamondStream Partners Alaska Airlines JetBlue and Amadeus.

13,PE/VC funding tanked 30% in 2022; here#39;s how Indian startups fared this year,"The average deal size of late-stage transactions (investment into companies that are over 10 years old, or Series G or later rounds of institutional investments) fell 39 percent to $90 million in 2022 from $148 million last year.",2022-12-31T05:35:17Z,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/pevc-funding-tanked-30-in-2022-heres-how-indian-startups-fared-this-year-9790201.html,The funds coming into Indian startups through the private equity PE and venture capital VC route slowed a little over 32 percent by value in 2022 as the ecosystem witnessed a prolonged effect of the funding winter. PEVC funds made 1130 bets on startups worth 23. 95 billion in 2022 while last year thanks to funds pouring into the ecosystem during 2021s funding frenzy private market investors had made 1215 bets worth 35. 46 billion the data showed. After the initial few months of 2022 with the pandemic receding and inflation rising central banks had been rolling back excess liquidity from the banking system and raising rates to tame inflation resulting in money becoming expensive. Investors both private and public market have thus cut back on their investments this year. According to the data shared by Venture Intelligence December recorded the lowest funding to startups in the last two years. Indian startups raised 799 million in 54 deals this month a drop of over 30 percent month on month from 1149 million in 69 deals recorded last month. Deal sizes Moneycontrol had reported earlier how the funding winter has also led to investors making smallersized bets especially at latestage deals. According to updated data by Venture Intelligence the average deal size of latestage transactions investment into companies that are over 10 years old or Series G or later rounds of institutional investments fell 39 percent to 90 million in 2022 from 148 million last year. Total investments in latestage deals also almost halved to 6584 million in 2022 from 12297 million last year. However earlyandgrowthstage deal sizes have gone up in 2022 versus 2021. The average cheque sizes of growth stage deals Series C and Series D have gone up to 7. 9 million this year from 6. 9 million last year. Earlystage deal sizes meanwhile have gone up to 4 million on average in 2022 from 3. 4 million in 2021. Top deals in 2022 Among startups in 2022 VerSe Innovation which runs the news aggregator platform DailyHunt raised 805 million from Luxor Capital Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Sofina Baillie Gifford CPPIB Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Following it the next big deal was worth 700 million when Baron Capital and Prosus Ventures led a round in Swiggy. In 2021 Flipkart had raised 3. 6 billion from a clutch of investors including Antara Capital Tencent Qatar Investment Authority CPPIB SoftBank Corp Franklin Templeton PE Tiger Global and GIC among others in what was 2021s largest PEVC deal. Most active VC investors Sequoia Capital has retained its position as the mostactive investor by the number of deals in 2022. However this year Sequoia Capital has made 73 deals versus 110 in 2021 a fall of about 34 percent yearonyear. Interestingly Better Capital boosted deals this year making 57 investments compared to a low three last year.

The post A Beginner’s Guide to Gig Workers’ global campaign against Unfair Deactivation practices appeared first on MediaNama.",2023-01-12T07:59:34Z,https://www.medianama.com/2023/01/223-gig-workers-global-campaign-unfair-deactivation-practices-termination/,Whats the news Gig workers in eight cities of India will join the global campaign against unfair deactivation said the Indian Federation of AppBased Transport Workers IFAT union in a press release on January 11 2023. The campaign to stop unfair deactivation was started earlier this month by the International Alliance of Appbased Transport Workers IAATW. It launched a global petition as part of its yearlong mobilization to end sudden and unsubstantiated termination of driving privileges by multinationals. The workers called this practice the single largest cause of precarity in the appbased transportation industry. What is unfair deactivation According to the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union TGPWU every week companies like Ola Uber Swiggy Zomato etc allegedly block driver IDs of around 25 to 30 drivers. Leaders in the press release said that most drivers do not know the reason for this blocking nor are they provided a portal platform to resolve the issue. In fact the union said thousands of drivers in India and still more across the world experience such a deactivation on a daily basis without any understanding of the cause. This is so because most of the deactivation happens through algorithmic automation rather than a clearly stated cause. Deactivation an excuse for unlawful firing Biju Mathew IAATW President and Executive Council member New York Taxi Workers Alliance accused the companies of using the deactivation practice as a means of firing drivers.

18,Court Slams Mumbai Police For Filing Case Against Man Who Hit Dog With Bike,A division bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Prithviraj Chavan slammed Mumbai Police for registering an FIR mindlessly against a Swiggy food delivery executive accused of hitting a dog while riding motorbike.,2023-01-06T06:54:29Z,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/courts-slams-mumbai-police-for-filing-case-against-man-who-hit-dog-with-bike-3668688,A division bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Prithviraj Chavan slammed Mumbai Police for registering an FIR mindlessly against a Swiggy food delivery executive accused of hitting a dog while riding motorbike. Quashing the FIR it also ordered the government to pay him costs. While the judgement was delivered on December 20 the detailed order became available this week. No doubt a dogcat is treated as a child or family member by their owners but basic biology tells us that they are not human beings. Sections 279 and 337 of the Indian Penal Code pertain to acts endangering human life or likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person the bench said. Section 279 deals with rash driving while 337 deals with causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others. Thus legally speaking the said sections will have no application to the facts in hand this essential ingredient necessary to constitute the offences being amiss. The said sections do not recognize and make an offence any injury caused otherwise than to human being the court added. An FIR had been registered against Manas Godbole the petitioner after his motorbike allegedly hit a stray dog in Marine Drive area during lockdown in 2020. The petitioner who was delivering a food order himself was injured as the motorbike skidded. The FIR was registered on the complaint of a woman who was feeding stray dogs. The application of these sections by the Marine Drive police clearly shows nonapplication of mind. How sections 279 337 429 of the Indian Penal Code could have been applied to the case in hand even from a bare perusal of these sections defies logic it said. Considering that the police had lodged the said prosecution despite no offence having been disclosed we deem it appropriate to direct the state government to pay costs of Rs 20000 to the petitioner the court said. The amount shall be recovered from the salary of the police officers responsible for the lodging of the FIR and subsequent filing of the charge sheet the court said. Except for the headline this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.

A fivemember constitution bench headed by justice Abdul Nazeer found no flaws in the decisionmaking processin a 41 ruling. The government was empowered to take the decision and due process was followed the top court said. The court which declined to be drawn into ruling on the economic merits of the policy citing its lack of expertise said enough time was given to people to exchange the currency. Why its important In her dissenting judgement justice BV Nagarathna said the move was unlawful and should have been preceded by a parliamentary debate. The majority judgement however said demonetization satisfied the test of proportionality. Stock markets ring in new year with rising indices in first trading session Indian gauges logged gains on the first trading day of 2023 riding on a combination of buying in index majors steady European markets and a boost in sentiment after the release of macroeconomic data. Both the indices clocked nearly 0. 5 per cent gains with the Sensex rising 327 points to end the session at 61168 while the 50share Nifty ended at 18197 a gain of 92 points.

Manufacturing activity in India rises to a 26month high signaling resilient demand Indias manufacturing activity rebounded to a 26month high in December led by strong expansion in new orders and production according to the SP Global India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index.

Government to deliberate merits of letting large defaulters continue holding reins The central government will examine recommendations to let shareholders of large defaulters retain control of the businesses while exploring fresh investments and corporate restructuring with its lenders outside bankruptcy tribunals. The insolvency law committee of the corporate affairs ministry will examine this proposal in detail. The proposal to let the existing management retain control contrasts the original bankruptcy code structure of creditors taking control after the admission of the bankruptcy petition.

Technology firms slow down hiring in face of impending economic recession in the West Indias technology companies are sharply reducing their hiring mandates with industry estimates pointing to a nearly 90 per cent drop in December from a peak of over 110000 monthly active openings a year ago.

Why its important The shrinking mandate has been gathering pace in the second half of 2022 as high inflation and recessionary concerns deepened across the US and European markets.

29,"Should you opt for travel now, pay later schemes this holiday season?","When people do not have enough cash in hand, they may choose pay later or save now and travel later options, but features like these, which provide instant gratification, are mostly not-so-healthy.",2022-12-25T15:09:27Z,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/should-you-opt-for-travel-now-pay-later-schemes-this-holiday-season-9755671.html,Cleartrip a travel booking portal is all set to launch its travel now pay later feature by the end of this week. We are going to launch it for a limited user base as of now and then gradually plan to scale it up says Prahlad Krishnamurthi chief business officer Cleartrip. The applicants credit worthiness and the customer base with which we initiate our launch will be evaluated by the fintechs we have partnered with. As the name suggests travel now pay later TNPL is about making dream travel possible by availing a quick loan. It is the travel version of buy now pay later BNPL schemes that customers have grown accustomed to in retail. TNPL is essentially a loan or credit that you take out when booking or taking a trip and pay for it in installments. You can either pay partially or not at all while booking and do so later within a specified duration. You can avail of nocost EMIs or pay an interest rate on the borrowed amount depending on the quantum of funds borrowed and the duration for which you are taking the loan. Consumers switching to Buy Now Pay Later Indian consumers are spoilt for choice when it comes to putting off paying for their purchases. As if credit cards and equal equated installments werent enough over the last three years many fintech firms have come up with the BNPL feature. The onset of the COVID19 pandemic in 2020 further nudged many consumers to switch to BNPL schemes. According to a report by GlobalData a data analysis firm the transaction value of BNPL services is estimated to increase at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 32. 5 percent between 2022 and 2026 to reach INR1. 1 trillion 15 billion in four years. Buy Now Pay Later for millennials According to a ZestMoney report on Indian consumers opting for BNPL solutions in 2020 the average age of consumers who opt for BNPL is 34 years. As per its 2020 report consumers who availed this facility typically spend on online education purchasing of highend smartphones electronic appliances fashion and travel. Shivani Gupta senior banking and payments analyst at GlobalData says BNPL which is already very popular in Australia and many European markets is gradually gaining traction in India especially among millennials. It provides consumers with the flexibility to pay for purchases at later dates with nointerest making it a lucrative payment tool particularly for those who do not own credit cards. Further with pandemic adversely affecting consumers disposable income the demand for shortterm consumer financing solutions has increased in the past couple of years. Even though the target market for these providers are millennials these early earners should not give into impulse spending and rather still plan their finances well says Kalpesh Ashar a SEBIregistered investment adviser. How does BNPL work To put it simply the buynowpaylater scheme allows you to buy something now and then stagger your payments. A most basic form of BNPL is when you run a book with a fintech firm. Once you enroll with the firm it allows you to buy products from any of its partner merchants online stores within a certain time period say 1530 days and then allows you to settle all your bills at the end of the cycle. If you delay your payments beyond this cycle then it levies an interest cost depending on your bill amount. Some BNPL firms also allow you to convert your highcost purchases into nocost credit for three to six months. Some of the fintech firms in this segment are Amazon Pay ePayLater Kissht LazyPay Simpl Slice ZestMoney etc. The BNPL is also an option thats available with ecommerce websites like Flipkart Amazon BigBasket and so on and also on food delivery mobile applications like Zomato and Swiggy and even in trip booking portals such as Goibibo and Cleartrip. How do the BNPL charges work BNPL works as an alternative to your credit cards. For instance if you make purchases from within the Simpl app through its 2500 plus merchants your bill gets generated every 15 days. If you fail to clear your bill by the due date a late penalty of up to Rs 250 plus GST is levied. These charges might appear small but experts like Ashar says that if unchecked they can balloon into something big and unmanageable. Failure to repay your bills can not just lead to incurring charges as mentioned earlier it can also lead to a negative impact on your credit score. This is because by not paying your bills on time you display an inability to pay back what you owe and this can reduce your credit score. This can lead to difficulties in getting loan approvals in the future. There are no free lunches and anything that gives you instant gratification in the financial world is not healthy adds Ashar.
