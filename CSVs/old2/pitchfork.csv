As the Los Angeles Times and Pitchfork report the decision was made after Smithline failed to find new representation when her legal counsel withdrew from the case in October. The lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice meaning Smithline can refile the case if she finds new representation or chooses to represent herself. The allegations in Smithlines lawsuit arent the only such accusations Manson real name Brian Warner has faced in recent years. The 54yearold rock musician is currently the subject of a lawsuit from actress Esm Bianco that alleges he sexually assaulted her in May a lawsuit from Mansons former assistant Ashley Walters accusing him of sexual assault and harassment was dismissed due to the claims falling outside Californias statute of limitations. In 2021 one of Mansons exgirlfriends sued Manson alleging he had raped her and tried to kill her the lawsuit was dismissed for falling outside the statute of limitations but was refiled shortly after. In a statement to Pitchfork Mansons lawyer Howard King said We thank and commend Ashley Smithline for dismissing her claims against Brian Warner without seeking or receiving anything in return. Ms Smithline has refused to be manipulated by others who are trying to pursue their own agendas against Mr Warner. We wish her well and will continue to work to assure that a significant price will be paid by those who have tried to abuse our legal system. All four lawsuits against Manson were filed after actress Evan Rachel Wood Mansons former partner came forward with allegations of abuse against the musician in early 2021. Manson started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years she said at the time. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. Wood further detailed her allegations in the documentary Phoenix Rising Manson is currently suing her for defamation.

2,Ditching noncompete clauses would be a win for workers' rights and employees in low-wage jobs,"In practice, noncompete agreements force many low-wage workers to stay at jobs when they might want to leave for better opportunities.",https://www.businessinsider.com/noncompete-clauses-ban-low-wage-workers-equity-fair-ftc-2023-1,Ditching noncompete clauses would be a win for workers rights and employees in lowwage jobs The Federal Trade Commission proposed a rule that would ban noncompete clauses. Noncompetes prevent some workers in lowwage jobs from leaving for better opportunities. One way to tell how much an employer cares about treating everyday workers fairly isnt by what it says its by whether the company makes lowwage workers sign noncompete agreements. In theory noncompetes are meant to protect a company from having a highlevel executive with inside info jump to a competitor or start a rival shop. But in practice things are a lot murkier. The Federal Trade Commission is now challenging the longstanding practice saying the 109year law is exploitative and unfair. If the FTC succeeds in banning noncompete clauses it can be an important win for lowwage workers and a pivotal moment in the push for workplace equity advocates for the change say. The proposed rule could in effect force more companies to offer up what they boast about in job listings fair working conditions and competitive pay. Jimmy ODonnell a former researcher with the Economic Innovation Group a bipartisan publicpolicyresearch organization said that noncompetes strip workers of their autonomy. Banning the use of noncompete agreements would go a long way in raising wages for workers and empowering more wouldbe entrepreneurs to start new companies he wrote in a 2021 blog post. Many lowwage workers are forced to abide by noncompetes Critics point out that many workers subject to noncompete language arent highprofile executives whove amassed trade secrets theyre average workers. In 2015 The Verge reported on Amazons use of noncompete agreements for warehouse workers. After criticism the retail giant removed the clause from contracts for US hourly workers news outlets including The Guardian reported. The next year Jimmy Johns a sandwich chain dropped its use of noncompetes after a settlement. And in 2017 an employee at a McDonalds franchise sued her employer over such rules. Noncompetes are being used systematically even for workers who have no access to trade secrets or less than a college education Evan Starr an assistant professor at the University of Maryland told The Baltimore Sun in 2017. Charlotte Garden a law professor at the Seattle University School of Law told The Verge that employers knew they could prey on people with limited power to negotiate their employment terms. When you have a morevulnerable workforce applying for jobs Garden said theyre not going to attempt to negotiate the terms of the contract theyre handed. That lowers wages for all workers the FTC said. One of the key ways workers get raises in our economy is they change jobs Heidi Shierholz the Economic Policy Institutes policy director told CBS in 2019. If you take away that avenue it hurts wage growth. Noncompetes cost workers almost 300 billion a year in lost income by preventing people from taking their skills to another employer for more money or better conditions the FTC said. There are other ways employers can protect their secrets There are alternatives to noncompetes that can shield employers from losing important intellectual property when a skilled employee leaves for a competitor or to start a company. Businesses can have employees sign nonsolicitation agreements that prevent workers from wooing colleagues or customers to take them to a competing company. Bosses can also have employees sign nondisclosure agreements relating to trade secrets a lawyer at the firm Morgan Westfield noted. Paul Constant an editor at Civic Ventures a progressive advocacy group and a cohost of the Pitchfork Economics podcast wrote an oped challenging the fairness of noncompetes in 2021. Noncompete agreements help artificially stifle competition in the labor market allowing employers to keep wages low by limiting workers employment options Constant wrote. They eliminate the only real leverage American employees have left the threat that they can leave and find work somewhere else for better pay benefits and workplace standards.

4,Universal Music Group Sues Triller Over Unpaid License Fees,UMG alleges that the video app has missed payments for the past nine months,https://pitchfork.com/news/universal-music-group-sues-triller-over-unpaid-license-fees/,Universal Music Group UMG has filed a lawsuit against video app Triller over unpaid license fees Variety reports and Pitchfork can confirm. The complaint which was filed in a Los Angeles court alleges that Triller has missed payments for the past nine months thereby violating its licensing agreement with the publishing giant. According to documents viewed by Variety Triller has failed to produce three installments of the payment plan outlined in its contract. The complaint states that the videosharing app agreed to pay nearly 3 million for licensing and past use of the UMG catalog over a period of two years with payments required on a quarterly basis. UMG is also alleging that Triller agreed to pay 1 million for use of its catalog by thirdparty advertisers or in promotional contentbut only three of the required six quarterly payments have been made. In lieu of these payments Triller has allegedly made written and oral promises to heed the agreement. UMG claims it has notified Triller that it is terminating its agreement as a result of these alleged breaches of contract. When reached for comment a Triller spokesperson offered the following statement to Pitchfork UMG and Triller have had their differences in the past in 2021 UMG pulled its catalog from the app claiming that Triller shamefully withheld payments owed to our artists. A Triller spokesperson denied the allegation telling Pitchfork that they categorically deny that Triller had withheld any artist payments. Within months the two companies resolved the matter and announced their licensing deal. Last year Sony Music Entertainment withdrew the rights to its catalog from Triller claiming the company owed millions in royalty payments. The company subsequently sued the app for copyright infringement and breach of contract stating that Triller failed to honor its licensing agreements termination. At the time a representative for Triller told Pitchfork that the complaint grossly mischaracterizes its relationship with Sony and leans into the bully persona large music labels are often criticized for. In August of 2022 Swizz Beatz and Timbaland filed a lawsuit against Triller claiming the company still owed them 28 million after buying Verzuz. The suit was settled the following month. Pitchfork has reached out to UMG for further information and comment.
5,Taylor Swift Fans File Second Lawsuit Against Ticketmaster Over Eras Tour Debacle,"The federal class action lawsuit alleges that the ticketing company engaged in fraud, price fixing, anticompetitive behavior, “intentional misrepresentation,” and more",https://pitchfork.com/news/taylor-swift-fans-file-second-lawsuit-against-ticketmaster-over-eras-tour-debacle/,Another group of Taylor Swift fans is suing Ticketmaster in the aftermath of the recent Eras Tour ticketing debacle Rolling Stone reports and Pitchfork can confirm. Earlier this month fans filed a lawsuit alleging that the ticketing company engaged in fraud pricefixing and antitrust violations and now a second lawsuit obtained by Pitchfork has been filed. In the latter federal class action lawsuit which was filed on Tuesday December 20 the group alleges that Ticketmaster violated antitrust laws and participated in anticompetitive and misleading conduct. Ticketmaster intentionally and purposefully misled millions of fans into believing it would prevent bots and scalpers from participating in the presales the lawsuit says. However millions of fans were unable to purchase tickets during the TaylorSwiftTix Presale and the Capital One Presale due in large part to unprecedented website traffic caused by Ticketmaster allowing 14 million unverified Ticketmaster users and a staggering number of bots to participate in the presales. In addition to the antitrust violations the 26 plaintiffs also allege that Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation Entertainment Inc. engaged in fraud price fixing false advertising and intentional misrepresentation among other allegations. By allowing primary ticket purchasers to resell tickets during the TaylorSwiftTix Presale Ticketmaster represented that these tickets were being sold according to the face value prices negotiated by Taylor Swift Management when they were not the lawsuit reads. Plaintiffs are seeking a civil fine of 2500 per violation in addition to coverage of the costs of attorneys fees and other legal fees. Following the previous lawsuit Ticketmaster took to social media to address the incident. We want to apologize to Taylor and all of her fansespecially those who had a terrible experience trying to purchase tickets the company tweeted. We feel we owe it to everyone to share some information to help explain what happened. The statement included a link to a page on its website which explained the circumstances that led to the cancellation. The United States Department of Justice has also taken interest in Ticketmasters alleged anticompetitive behavior. In November The New York Times reported that an antitrust investigation had been opened and is focused on whether Live Nation Entertainment has abused its power over the multibilliondollar live music industry. The decision to open the investigation precedes the Eras Tour presale.

12,Black Sheep Sue Universal Music Group Over Spotify Stock Sales,The musicians allege that label owes more than $750 million in unpaid royalties due to an early arrangement with Spotify,https://pitchfork.com/news/black-sheep-sue-universal-music-group-over-spotify-stock-sales/,Black Sheep have filed a classaction lawsuit against Universal Music Group Rolling Stone reports and Pitchfork can confirm. The 1990s hiphop duo allege that the label owes more than 750 million in royalties to numerous Universal artists due to an early sweetheart arrangement with Spotify which allowed the streaming company to pay less in royalties in exchange for Spotify stock. The artists are suing Universal for breach of contract breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing and unjust enrichment. In the lawsuit plaintiffs Andres Dres Vargas Titus and William Mista Lawnge McLean allege that Universal is withholding hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties due to a previously undisclosed agreement with Spotify. This sweetheart arrangement allowed Spotify to license music from the label at a discounted rate in exchange for Spotify stock and lower royalty payments. In the mid2000s Universal struck an undisclosed sweetheart deal with Spotify whereby Universal agreed to accept substantially lower royalty payments on artists behalf in exchange for equity stake in Spotifythen a fledgling streaming service the lawsuit claims. Yet rather than distribute to artists their 50 percent of Spotify stock or pay artists their true and accurate royalty payments for years Universal shortchanged artists and deprived Plaintiffs and Class Members of the full royalty payments they were owned under Universals contract. The rappers claim that the deal violated their 1990 contract with Polygram which later merged with Universal. The contract stipulated that the label must pay 50 percent of all net receipts connected to the use or exploration of their music to the artists themselves based on the standard recording contract that Universal uses. Universal not only has breached its contract with Plaintiffs by failing to compensate them for the depressed royalty payments made possible by UMGs deal with Spotify but it also concealed from Plaintiffs and the Class that the Company had received and retained 100 percent of its Spotify stock the lawsuit continues. This additional wrong prevented Plaintiffs and the Class from questioning their royalty payments. The lawsuit also notes that while Titus and McLean dont know exactly how many artists are affected they believe that the Class encompasses at least thousands of artists whose identities can be readily ascertained from Universals records. In a statement a Universal Music Group spokesperson said Universal Music Groups innovative leadership has led to the renewed growth of the music ecosystem to the benefit of recording artists songwriters and creators around the world. UMG has a wellestablished track record of fighting for artist compensation and the claim that it would take equity at the expense of artist compensation is patently false and absurd. Given that this is pending litigation we cannot comment on all aspects of the complaint. Pitchfork has reached out to representatives for Black Sheep and Spotify for more information.

18,Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler Sued for 1970s Sexual Abuse of a Minor: Report,A woman claims that the singer sexually assaulted and sexually battered her when she was a 16-year-old in 1973,https://pitchfork.com/news/aerosmith-steven-tyler-sued-for-1970s-sexual-abuse-of-a-minor/,Steven Tyler is being sued by a woman who alleges that the Aerosmith frontman sexually assaulted and sexually battered her when she was a minor in the 1970s Rolling Stone reports. The lawsuit as Rolling Stone notes could be filed due to Californias Child Victims Act which temporarily lifted the statute of limitations for alleged survivors of childhood sexual abuse to file complaints. In the lawsuit the plaintiff Julia Holcomb alleges that she met Tyler in 1973 when she was 16 years old and he was 25. The two apparently had a relationship that lasted three years and Holcomb now alleges that she was powerless to resist the singers power fame and substantial financial ability and that he coerced and persuaded Plaintiff into believing this was a romantic love affair. In addition to sexual assault and sexual battery Holcomb is suing Tyler for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Steven Tyler is not specifically named in the lawsuit but contemporaneous details align with the singer being the complaints defendant. For example Julia Holcomb is named in Rolling Stones 1976 profile of Aerosmith with journalist Ed McCormack writing WellJulia Holcomb is always nearby trailing in her wistfully towering way off his arm like a scarfbut Steven Tyler is wedded to his career and image 24 hours a day. In addition Tyler apparently wrote about a relationship with an underage girl in his 2011 memoir. Holcomb also named Tyler in a statement she released regarding the lawsuit. I want this action to expose an industry that protects celebrity offenders to cleanse and hold accountable an industry that both exploited and allowed me to be exploited for years along with so many other nave and vulnerable kids and adults she wrote. Because I know that I am not the only one who suffered abuse in the music industry I feel it is time for me to take this stand and bring this action to speak up and stand in solidarity with the other survivors. I hope that from this action we can make the music industry safer expose the predators in it and expose those forces in the industry that have both enabled and created a culture of permissiveness and selfprotection of themselves and the celebrity offenders among them.

The hiphop legends run from 1989 through 2001 will be released digitally via bandmember Maseos label AOI in partnership with Reservoir and the distribution wing of Chrysalis.

Its been 20 plus years overdue but finally we are here Maseo said in a press release. Physical reissues are also set for release on March 3. The news comes after a false start in 2019 when De La Soul suggested that Tommy Boys plans to bring their classic records to streaming services involved an exploitative contract. The planned release was canceled after a public outcry. In 2021 the band said the dispute had been resolved after Reservoir acquired Tommy Boy. De La Souls last album was 2016s And the Anonymous Nobody which had been their first since 2004s The Grind Date. The 2016 album featured Little Dragon David Byrne Damon Albarn Usher and others and came with a documentary called Were Still Here Now. In 2017 De La Soul jumped on Gorillazs Humanz track Momentz.

25,Dr. Dre Sends Cease to Desist to Marjorie Taylor Greene Over “Still D.R.E.”,"The controversial Republican congresswoman used the 2001 single in a promotional video. Through his attorney, Dre told Greene, “You are wrongfully exploiting this work through the various social media outlets to promote your divisive and hateful political age…",https://pitchfork.com/news/dr-dre-sends-cease-to-desist-to-marjorie-taylor-greene-over-still-dre/,Dr. Dre has condemned Representative Marjorie Taylor Greenes use of his 2001 song Still D. R. E. in a promotional video TMZ reports. In a statement to the media outlet the rapper and producer said I dont license my music to politicians especially someone as divisive and hateful as this one. Dr. Dres attorney Howard E. King has also sent a letter to Taylor Greene demanding that she cease the unauthorized use of Dres music. You are wrongfully exploiting this work through the various social media outlets to promote your divisive and hateful political agenda King wrote. Demand is hereby made that you cease and desist from any further unauthorized use of Dr. Dres music. Greene the controversial Republican congresswoman from Georgia had used the Still D. R. E. instrumental in a sinceremoved video she posted on Twitter to celebrate Kevin McCarthys election as speaker of the House. When reached by Pitchfork a representative shared the following statement from the congresswoman to Dr. Dre While I appreciate the creative chord progression I would never play your words of violence against women and police officers and your glorification of the thug life and drugs. Musicians have often asked politicians to stop using their music without permission. Neil Young for one went so far as to sue Donald J. Trumps presidential campaign over the use of Rockin in the Free World and Devils Sidewalk at rallies and events. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a Trump supporter who has repeated false claims of election fraud. She has also shown support for the conspiracy theory movement QAnon made Islamophobic and antisemitic remarks and had her Twitter account suspended for months after spreading misinformation about COVID19.
26,Dr. Dre Selling Music Assets to Universal Music Group and Shamrock Capital: Report,The deals include the master recordings for The Chronic and are reportedly worth upwards of $200 million,https://pitchfork.com/news/dr-dre-selling-music-assets-to-universal-music-group-and-shamrock-capital-report/,Dr. Dre is selling several of his music assets and income streams in deals with both Universal Music Group UMG and Shamrock Capital Billboard and Variety report. The combined sale price is said to exceed 200 million. Pitchfork has reached out to representatives for Dr. Dre UMG and Shamrock for comment. Assets acquired by Shamrock Capital reportedly include Dres artist royalties from two of his solo albums his share of N. W. A. artist royalties his producer royalties and the writers share of his song catalog where he doesnt own publishingwhich potentially includes his writers share of The Chronic which is published by Sony Music Publishing. UMG has reportedly acquired the master recordings for Dres 1992 debut LP The Chronicwhich are set to revert to Dre from Death Row Entertainment in August 2023and his share of Kendrick Lamars releases through the Top Dawg Entertainment deal with Interscope a UMG subsidiary and Dres Aftermath imprint. Dre is said to retain his stake in Aftermath which he coowns with Interscope. The sale of Dres assets come in the wake of the recent ceaseanddesist that his lawyers sent Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green who used Dres song Still D. R. E. in a video posted to Twitter. The letter promised Dre will never grant the congresswoman permission to broadcast or disseminate any of his music. It is unclear to what degree Dre will be able to restrict anyone from licensing his music after the sale. The speculative market for music assets continues to grow expanding from classic rock and pop artists like Genesis Bob Dylan Leonard Cohen David Bowie and Bruce Springsteen to include hiphop artists like Chuck D Future and now Dr. Dre. In 2020 the institutionally backed investment firm Shamrockoriginally founded in 1978 by Roy E. Disney as Shamrock Holdingsacquired six Taylor Swift albums from Scooter Brauns Ithaca Holdings which famously purchased the rights from her former label Big Machine. Swift has since rerecorded two of the albums purchased by Shamrock.
27,"Weapons-grade 808s, luscious horns and a megastar’s early steps: the best music our writers discovered this year","From a slept-on Chief Keef banger to an overlooked Taylor Swift classic and a neglected jazz Kenny, we reveal the older releases that have got us going this yearAs someone generally averse to the fact that album releases never seem to slow down any more, even…",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/dec/30/the-best-music-our-writers-discovered-this-year,Chief Keef 4NEM 2021 As someone generally averse to the fact that album releases never seem to slow down any more even at the end of December I managed to miss Chief Keefs 4NEM when it dropped in late December last year. Known for pioneering drill before it splintered into a thousand different global subgenres the Chicago rapper is beloved for the kind of abrasive pottymouthed raps that older listeners shake their fists at but which send younger listeners into a craze. The cover art of 4NEM depicting a gang of toy soldiers engaged midcombat is an apt taste of what the album contains. Keefs hilarious one liners make intense violence sound comical. On Hadouken he even references classic teen films Yous a fuckin cheerleader bring it on. The production is equally zany designed to match Keefs frenetic energy. His army of producers mash together samples of guns being loaded explosions and synths that resemble operatic choirs. Most striking is 4NEMs use of earthshattering bass I dont think Ive ever heard harder 808s. This is music that requires loud speakers it splits eardrums as much as it does public opinion. CO Half Man Half Biscuit Bob Wilson Anchorman 2016 Because there are so many Half Man Half Biscuit songs out there and because so many of them seem utterly impenetrable on first listen either because the lyrical references are so obscure or because the music sounds like a total racket I find that new instances of Nigel Blackwells genius slowly reveal themselves to me each year. This years pick a song pondering how the former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson became one of our most prominent sports broadcasters featuring a completely tangential verse about being cold in the Irish town of Dundalk Its raining soup and Ive got a fork. Its hard to think of a record that could possibly be any less relevant in 2022 and thank God for that. TJ Handsome Boy Modeling School and Cat Power Ive Been Thinking 2004 I went down a deep Cat Power rabbit hole earlier this year pushed over the edge by her fantastic and underrated new covers collection. Reading every Pitchfork review of her catalogue I was introduced to Ive Been Thinking a 2004 collaboration with Handsome Boy Modeling School Dan the Automator and Prince Paul thats totally unlike anything else in her catalogue. Its five minutes of honeyed atmospheric soul music anchored by Cat Powers luxuriant and understated vocal which drifts and meanders as if it has floated in from another song entirely. Its perfect mood music evoking the image of Cat Power as a lounge singer in some smokefilled underground jazz club. SD Kenny Wheeler Music for Large and Small Ensembles 1990 Jazz is a medium full of Kennys there is the muchmaligned smooth jazzer Kenny G Miles Davis collaborator Kenny Garrett bebop trumpeter Kenny Dorham British bandleader Kenny Ball the list goes on. Earlier this year someone I interviewed referenced the Canadian composer Kenny Wheeler as an influence so I stuck on his Music for Large and Small Ensembles as I wrote up my piece. It blew me away. As its title suggests Wheeler composes 15 tracks for everything from orchestral big bands down to duo formations with John Taylor on piano and Peter Erskine on drums. His eightpart big band suite channels the luscious swing of Duke Ellington opening on an affecting choral fanfare while the small ensembles sink deep into delicate melodies as Wheeler slips and squeals on his trumpet. It embodies the wide spectrum of improvised music making Wheeler possibly my favourite jazz Kenny to date. AK Llwybr Llaethog Mad 1996 Novelty throwback edits and big drops are the order of the day at clubs right now so hearing ElectroSian by Llwybr Llaethog emerge on a dancefloor this summer felt refreshing. Its an explosive electro number with disorientating dub sensibilities and screeches of guitar flecked throughout a far cry from the clean and catchy crowd pleasers doing the rounds. Staying true to its title the rest of the record is just as bonkers. Alongside the pacier cuts are downtempo steppers with wonky percussion alien electronics and agitated Welsh language vocal samples flung in. Ambient noise interludes heavier moments Llandub and a slice of moody cold wave Ffanny add a layer of eerie quiet to the chaos. With its sleazy eccentricity and deep rattling instrumentals Mad is a collection of sounds that could easily have its origins in 80s Germany 90s New York or in London soundsystem culture. Its origin in a former mining town in Wales makes it even more exciting. SB Oby Onyioha Enjoy Your Life 1981 Perhaps it was grimly predictable but since turning 30 all the best new music I have discovered has been new to me but decades old. My occasional forays into the pop charts and Spotify trending playlists have left me feeling like an anthropologist in a strange land where what I understand as music is not necessarily worse but certainly more precise metallicsounding buffed and honed to a sharp point. Increasingly Ive been craving the musical equivalent of satin or corduroy languorous even baggy not a hook that grabs you by the jugular but a vibe that you can sink into like a bean bag. Im not sure how I first heard Enjoy Your Life by Nigerian singer Oby Onyioha maybe in a 6 Music mix true to my advancing age but I experienced it as a bodily relief. That midtempo beat the predictable strings and brass motifs the minimal escalation in energy over six minutes it has all of discos lust for life but it still works if your only vices are two glasses of red and an early bedtime. And better than anything else Ive heard lately it captures the necessity of pursuing pleasure the importance of prioritising fun even or especially when it seems elusive. Its your right to enjoy your life even in unprecedented times. EH Roy Montgomery Temple IV1996 This summer when interviewing Dry Cleaning for Mojo magazine I was tasked with asking each band member for one influence on their excellent new album Stumpwork. Guitarist Tom Dowse cited the New Zealand guitarist Roy Montgomery and mentioned that he had once been in a band Dadamah that was signed to US indie label Kranky. Liking both Dowses playing on the new album and Krankys output very much indeed I saved the album behind his most popular song on Spotify then forgot about it for months. I dont really believe in cosmic forces but I do think music sometimes finds you when its meant to and in a period of personal desolation not to mention during a subzero week in Berlin his 1996 album Temple IV hit me at the right time. Its a thick instrumental tundra of guitar playing alternately sharp and whiteknuckled shearing flesh from bone and loose jangling and searching music to lose yourself in to override the static of your mind. Its swiftly become an alltime favourite. Proof that you cant beat the human algorithm although Spotify took note of my obsessive listening and pointed me towards his new album which I would otherwise have missed so I indulged my editors privileges to commission an interview with him for our pages in the hope of minting some more new Montgomery fans. LS Takeshi Terauchi Nippon Guitars Instrumental Surf Eleki Tsugaru Rock 19661974 2011 To discover Takeshi Terauchis work this year has been a blessing. Rightfully lauded as one of Japans guitar pioneers Terauchis influence and work has been catalogued neatly by UK record label Ace Records. Charting Terachis career from the 1960s surf boom via groovy instrumentals through to 70s fuzz freakouts and funk rock his 2011 compilation Nippon Guitars charmed me from its first punchy guitar licks. Taking you through a decade of exuberance and fun Terauchis instrumentation is always acerbic and sizzling. Its a welcome path to wander down. DB Tangerine Dream Network 23 1981 Paul Hartnoll from Orbital pointed me towards this tune on Tangerine Dreams 1981 album Exit after I suggested that the Berlin electronic giants best work was already behind them by the end of the 70s. Network 23 which subsequently gave a name to Spiral Tribes record label is fantastic a gradually building hypnotic trance track. The motorik rhythm is slightly reminiscent of German peers Neu but it also clearly points the way to house and techno at a point when both were years away. The ethereal synth line that suddenly erupts at around three minutes and 20 seconds is just glorious. I consider myself told. DS Taylor Swift Today Was a Fairytale 2010 When Taylor Swift released Red in 2012 she put me in a headlock which I am yet to escape from. Her earlier releases hadnt captured me Id mistakenly judged them as too whimsical too middle American with a faint whiff of early2000s Silver Ring Thing energy. Buried among those early records was a nonalbum single called Today Was a Fairytale that Ive recently become obsessed with. Its not Swifts most sophisticated song but its guilelessness is its charm. Something about its simplicity hotwires my nervous system creating nostalgia for an innocent adolescence that as a queer person I never actually experienced. Three listens to its soaring chorus and I could walk through a brick wall. The campaign for Taylor to include it on her Eras tour setlist starts here.

Marilyn Mansonhas been dismissed without prejudice in a California court with the Los Angeles Times reporting that the judge dismissed the suit because the accuser model Ashley Morgan Smithline fired her attorney in October and did not name a new one by the time of a December deadline. Since it was dismissed without prejudice though the suit can be refiled at any point over the same allegations. Smithline had accused Manson in 2021 of sexually assaulting her multiple times in 2010 with the LA Times story saying that her suit included an instance where Manson allegedly put a pillow over her face and used a knife to cut her shoulder inner arm and stomach as well as another instance where he allegedly cut his name into her and broke her nose. Manson has denied the allegations saying they were together for less than a week and that there are so many falsehoods within her claims that we wouldnt know where to begin to answer them. Pitchfork has shared a statement from Mansons attorney in light of this dismissal that not only frames it as a win for Manson but as an indication that Smithline is choosing to back down in lieu of being manipulated by others who are trying to pursue their own agendas. Heres the full statement We thank and commend Ashley Smithline for dismissing her claims against Brian Warner without seeking or receiving anything in return. Ms. Smithline has refused to be manipulated by others who are trying to pursue their own agendas against Mr. Warner. We wish her well and will continue to work to assure that a significant price will be paid by those who have tried to abuse our legal system. Manson is still facing a sexual assault lawsuit from actor Esm Bianco and he has filed a lawsuit against accuser Evan Rachel Wood who said in 2022 that she is very confident and not scared.
29,Pusha T Says He’s No Longer the President of Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music,The Virginia rapper was named the label’s president in 2015,https://pitchfork.com/news/pusha-t-says-hes-no-longer-the-president-of-kanye-west-good-music/,Pusha T has revealed in a new interview with XXL that he resigned as the president of Kanye Wests G. O. O. D. Music label. When explicitly asked if he was still the president of the company Pusha T responded No Im not. The interviewer then asked him to clarify that hes not tied with G. O. O. D. Music anymore in any way and the rapper confirmed thats the case. Pusha T originally accepted the presidential title back in 2015 but hes since established a 5050 deal with Def Jam for his solo music and his label Heir Wave Music Group. His most recent album Its Almost Dry is now his last for G. O. O. D. Music. Hes not speaking to me now Pusha T said of West in the XXL interview. If you aint with it you aint down. And I aint with it. Im not budging on that. Im not with it. I heard about this new stuff on InfoWars. I dont know. Its something that just sort of tells me hes not well at the same time. I will say that. Its going to places where its no way to move around it. During the InfoWars episode to which Pusha T referred West made a number of disturbing and hateful remarks while praising Adolf Hitler and Nazis. West also brought his new ally Nicholas J. Fuentesa white supremacist antisemite and Holocaust denierto the interview. Pitchfork has reached out to representatives for Pusha T for additional comment. West and G. O. O. D. Musics partnership with Def Jam ended back in 2021 prior to his recent antisemitism and hate speech. His relationship with Def Jam and parent company Universal Music Group was contentious for a number of years before splitting too. West sued UMG Def Jam and RocAFella Records as well as publisher EMI in 2019. The suit against EMI was settled the next year. He also tweeted his label contracts in 2020 amid a dispute with UMG. Last month Pusha T formally disavowed West in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. Its definitely affected me. Its been disappointing he said. As a Black man in America there is no room for bigotry or hate speech. So yeah. Its been very disappointing lets talk straight.
