As the Los Angeles Times and Pitchfork report the decision was made after Smithline failed to find new representation when her legal counsel withdrew from the case in October. The lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice meaning Smithline can refile the case if she finds new representation or chooses to represent herself. The allegations in Smithlines lawsuit arent the only such accusations Manson real name Brian Warner has faced in recent years. The 54yearold rock musician is currently the subject of a lawsuit from actress Esm Bianco that alleges he sexually assaulted her in May a lawsuit from Mansons former assistant Ashley Walters accusing him of sexual assault and harassment was dismissed due to the claims falling outside Californias statute of limitations. In 2021 one of Mansons exgirlfriends sued Manson alleging he had raped her and tried to kill her the lawsuit was dismissed for falling outside the statute of limitations but was refiled shortly after. In a statement to Pitchfork Mansons lawyer Howard King said We thank and commend Ashley Smithline for dismissing her claims against Brian Warner without seeking or receiving anything in return. Ms Smithline has refused to be manipulated by others who are trying to pursue their own agendas against Mr Warner. We wish her well and will continue to work to assure that a significant price will be paid by those who have tried to abuse our legal system. All four lawsuits against Manson were filed after actress Evan Rachel Wood Mansons former partner came forward with allegations of abuse against the musician in early 2021. Manson started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years she said at the time. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. Wood further detailed her allegations in the documentary Phoenix Rising Manson is currently suing her for defamation.

2,Ditching noncompete clauses would be a win for workers' rights and employees in low-wage jobs,"In practice, noncompete agreements force many low-wage workers to stay at jobs when they might want to leave for better opportunities.",https://www.businessinsider.com/noncompete-clauses-ban-low-wage-workers-equity-fair-ftc-2023-1,Ditching noncompete clauses would be a win for workers rights and employees in lowwage jobs The Federal Trade Commission proposed a rule that would ban noncompete clauses. Noncompetes prevent some workers in lowwage jobs from leaving for better opportunities. One way to tell how much an employer cares about treating everyday workers fairly isnt by what it says its by whether the company makes lowwage workers sign noncompete agreements. In theory noncompetes are meant to protect a company from having a highlevel executive with inside info jump to a competitor or start a rival shop. But in practice things are a lot murkier. The Federal Trade Commission is now challenging the longstanding practice saying the 109year law is exploitative and unfair. If the FTC succeeds in banning noncompete clauses it can be an important win for lowwage workers and a pivotal moment in the push for workplace equity advocates for the change say. The proposed rule could in effect force more companies to offer up what they boast about in job listings fair working conditions and competitive pay. Jimmy ODonnell a former researcher with the Economic Innovation Group a bipartisan publicpolicyresearch organization said that noncompetes strip workers of their autonomy. Banning the use of noncompete agreements would go a long way in raising wages for workers and empowering more wouldbe entrepreneurs to start new companies he wrote in a 2021 blog post. Many lowwage workers are forced to abide by noncompetes Critics point out that many workers subject to noncompete language arent highprofile executives whove amassed trade secrets theyre average workers. In 2015 The Verge reported on Amazons use of noncompete agreements for warehouse workers. After criticism the retail giant removed the clause from contracts for US hourly workers news outlets including The Guardian reported. The next year Jimmy Johns a sandwich chain dropped its use of noncompetes after a settlement. And in 2017 an employee at a McDonalds franchise sued her employer over such rules. Noncompetes are being used systematically even for workers who have no access to trade secrets or less than a college education Evan Starr an assistant professor at the University of Maryland told The Baltimore Sun in 2017. Charlotte Garden a law professor at the Seattle University School of Law told The Verge that employers knew they could prey on people with limited power to negotiate their employment terms. When you have a morevulnerable workforce applying for jobs Garden said theyre not going to attempt to negotiate the terms of the contract theyre handed. That lowers wages for all workers the FTC said. One of the key ways workers get raises in our economy is they change jobs Heidi Shierholz the Economic Policy Institutes policy director told CBS in 2019. If you take away that avenue it hurts wage growth. Noncompetes cost workers almost 300 billion a year in lost income by preventing people from taking their skills to another employer for more money or better conditions the FTC said. There are other ways employers can protect their secrets There are alternatives to noncompetes that can shield employers from losing important intellectual property when a skilled employee leaves for a competitor or to start a company. Businesses can have employees sign nonsolicitation agreements that prevent workers from wooing colleagues or customers to take them to a competing company. Bosses can also have employees sign nondisclosure agreements relating to trade secrets a lawyer at the firm Morgan Westfield noted. Paul Constant an editor at Civic Ventures a progressive advocacy group and a cohost of the Pitchfork Economics podcast wrote an oped challenging the fairness of noncompetes in 2021. Noncompete agreements help artificially stifle competition in the labor market allowing employers to keep wages low by limiting workers employment options Constant wrote. They eliminate the only real leverage American employees have left the threat that they can leave and find work somewhere else for better pay benefits and workplace standards.
