S. claims at least 34 lives BUFFALO N. Y. Millions of people hunkered down against a deep freeze Sunday to ride out the winter storm that has killed at least 34 people across the United States and is expected to claim more lives after trapping some residents inside houses with heaping snow drifts and knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses. The scope of the storm has been nearly unprecedented stretching from the Great Lakes near Canada to the Rio Grande along the border with Mexico. About 60 of the U. S. population faced some sort of winter weather advisory or warning and temperatures plummeted drastically below normal from east of the Rocky Mountains to the Appalachians the National Weather Service said. Travelers weather woes are likely to continue with hundreds of flight cancellations already and more expected after a bomb cyclone when atmospheric pressure drops very quickly in a strong storm developed near the Great Lakes stirring up blizzard conditions including heavy winds and snow. Some 1707 domestic and international flights were canceled on Sunday as of about 2 p. m. EDT according to the tracking site FlightAware. The storm unleashed its full fury on Buffalo with hurricaneforce winds and snow causing whiteout conditions paralyzing emergency response efforts. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said almost every fire truck in the city was stranded Saturday. Officials said the airport would be shut through Tuesday morning. The National Weather Service said the snow total at the Buffalo Niagara International Airport stood at 43 inches 109 centimeters at 7 a. m. Sunday. Daylight revealed cars nearly covered by 6foot snowdrifts and thousands of houses some adorned in unlit holiday displays dark from a lack of power. With snow swirling down untouched and impassable streets forecasters warned that an additional 1 to 2 feet of snow was possible in some areas through early Monday morning amid wind gusts of 40 mph. Two people died in their suburban Cheektowaga New York homes Friday when emergency crews could not reach them in time to treat their medical conditions and another died in Buffalo. Four more deaths were confirmed overnight bringing the total to seven in Erie County. County Executive Mark Poloncarz warned there may be more dead. Some were found in cars some were found on the street in snowbanks said Poloncarz. We know there are people who have been stuck in cars for more than 2 days. Freezing conditions and dayold power outages had Buffalonians scrambling to get to anywhere that had heat amid what Hochul called the longest sustained blizzard conditions ever in the city. But with streets under a thick blanket of white that wasnt an option for people like Jeremy Manahan who charged his phone in his parked car after almost 29 hours without electricity. Theres one warming shelter but that would be too far for me to get to. I cant drive obviously because Im stuck Manahan said. And you cant be outside for more than 10 minutes without getting frostbit. Ditjak Ilunga of Gaithersburg Maryland was on his way to visit relatives in Hamilton Ontario for Christmas with his daughters Friday when their SUV was trapped in Buffalo. Unable to get help they spent hours with the engine running buffeted by wind and nearly buried in snow. By 4 a. m. Saturday their fuel nearly gone Ilunga made a desperate choice to risk the howling storm to reach a nearby shelter. He carried 6yearold Destiny on his back while 16yearold Cindy clutched their Pomeranian puppy following his footprints through drifts. If I stay in this car Im going to die here with my kids Ilunga recalled thinking. He cried when the family walked through the shelter doors. Its something I will never forget in my life. The storm knocked out power in communities from Maine to Seattle. But heat and lights were steadily being restored across the U. S. According to poweroutage. us less than 200000 customers were without power Sunday at 3 p. m. EDT down from a peak of 1. 7 million. Concerns about rolling blackouts across eastern states subsided Sunday after PJM Interconnection said its utilities could meet the days peak electricity demand. The midAtlantic grid operator had called for its 65 million consumers to conserve energy amid the freeze Saturday. In North Carolina less than 6500 customers had no power down from a peak of 485000. Across New England power has been restored to tens of thousands with just under 83000 people mostly in Maine still without it. In New York about 34000 households were still without power Sunday including 26000 in Erie County where utility crews and hundreds of National Guard troops battled high winds and struggled with getting stuck in the snow. Stormrelated deaths were reported in recent days all over the country 12 in Erie County New York ranging in age from 26 to 93 years old and another in Niagara County where a 27yearold man was overcome by carbon monoxide after snow blocked his furnace 10 in Ohio including an electrocuted utility worker and those killed in multiple car crashes six motorists killed in crashes in Missouri Kansas and Kentucky a Vermont woman struck by a falling branch an apparently homeless man found amid Colorados subzero temperatures and a woman who fell through Wisconsin river ice. In Jackson Mississippi city officials on Christmas Day announced that residents must now boil their drinking water due to water lines bursting in the frigid temperatures While in Tampa Florida the thermometer plunged below freezing for the first time in almost five years according to the National Weather Service a drop conducive to coldblooded iguanas falling out of trees. In Buffalo William Kless was up at 3 a. m. Sunday. He called his three children at their mothers house to wish them Merry Christmas and then headed off on his snowmobile for a second day spent shuttling people from stuck cars and frigid homes to a church operating as a warming shelter. Through heavy winddriven snow he brought about 15 people to the church in Buffalo on Saturday he said including a family of five transported onebyone. He also got a man in need of dialysis who had spent 17 hours stranded in his car back home where he could receive treatment. I just felt like I had to Kless said.,2022-12-25T22:54:24Z

3,"Xbox Game Pass starts 2023 with Persona, Monster Hunter",Xbox Game Pass starts January off with a relatively lean offering -- three massive RPGs to be released over the course of a week.,https://venturebeat.com/games/xbox-game-pass-starts-2023-with-persona-monster-hunter/,Game Pass subscribers are getting their first new games of 2023. Xbox announced its adding three new titles to the service next week. Its a smaller addition than usual for Game Pass but this is somewhat mitigated by all three games being massive RPGs. The titles are Persona 3 Portable Persona 4 Golden and Monster Hunter Rise. The two Persona titles join their JRPG sibling Persona 5 Royal on the service on January 19. Both tell supernatural comingofage stories. Monster Hunter Rise another RPG about as the name suggests hunting giant monsters launches on the service on January 20. While usually Game Pass additions comprise more titles and are spread over a number of weeks its first addition of 2023 is a shorter one. It didnt announce or launch any titles during the first week of the year. This is in contrast with January 2022 where Game Pass added several games throughout the month. Whether this is due to a lack of big launches or a shortage of games joining Game Pass remains to be seen. The first titles to leave Game Pass in 2023 depart on the 15th. These include Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc Nobody Saves The World Pupperazzi The Anacrusis We Happy Few and Windjammers 2. Most of these were added to the service last January.

4,‘He’s a financial serial killer’: how Bernie Madoff became the monster of Wall Street,"New Netflix docuseries details the crimes of the man who crafted a $64bn Ponzi scheme and those who protected himLocked inside his office on the 22nd floor of a New York building, René-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet sliced his arms open and bled into a trash…",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/04/netflix-bernie-madoff-monster-of-wall-street,Locked inside his office on the 22nd floor of a New York building RenThierry Magon de la Villehuchet sliced his arms open and bled into a trash can to avoid making a mess for the cleaning lady. He chose the methodology of death that he did a painful solution to atone for his sins of omission says Frank Casey a financial investor who worked with Villehuchet. What a waste of a man. The French investment fund manager had lost 1. 5bn of his clients money to Bernie Madoff the architect of the biggest Ponzi scheme in American history who had surrendered to police 11 days earlier. The story of Madoffs rise and fall and how his illusory gift for defying the gravity of financial markets shattered countless lives is told in a fourpart documentary released on Netflix on 4 January. Madoff The Monster of Wall Street features whistleblowers employees investigators and victims as well as previously unseen video depositions of Madoff himself. One interviewee describes him as a financial sociopath a serial financial killer. Another says he was a man of pure evil whose tale will still be told a hundred years from now. But the film also makes the argument that it is facile to suppose that the epic 64bn securities swindle which wiped out life savings and ruined charities was the brainchild of a single villain. It would not have been possible without partners in crime and financial institutions willing to turn a blind eye. Speaking via Zoom from his home in New Yorks Hudson Valley the documentarys director Joe Berlinger says Over time the aura of this story and how the story was originally reported and how most people think about the story is one evil genius who was so charming and manipulative he did all this terrible stuff. The reality which is underreported and a cautionary tale for everybody who has any kind of financial assets in the market is he got away with it because of a whole cadre of literal coconspirators or people who should have known better. The documentary traces how Madoff was born in a middleclass Jewish neighbourhood in Queens New York in 1938. Along with his brother Peter he saved a few thousand dollars from working as a lifeguard and installing sprinklers before setting out to conquer Wall Street. By the 1980s the era of Gordon Gekko and The Bonfire of the Vanities the brothers were running a legitimate business buying and selling stock from an office in midtown Manhattan. Madoff made history by launching Nasdaq the first electronic stock exchange and advised the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on the system. Berlinger 61 a selfconfessed stock market geek whose past works include Conversations with a Killer Crime Scene and Brothers Keeper observes Hes a guy who largely is responsible for computerised trading which led to these offexchange dealers all coming together and creating one computer screen so to speak which is the origin of the Nasdaq. Bernie Madoff is largely responsible for legitimising that market the electronic exchange that today Google Microsoft Apple are part of. The irony of this is he was a great innovator and that certainly is why people trusted him. But there were just too many red flags to ignore. The SEC failed to spot those red flags. In a separate office Madoff was secretly robbing Peter to pay Paul using cash from new investors to pay returns to old ones. An IBM computer churned out monthly statements showing steady doubledigit returns even during market downturns. By the end of 2008 the statements claimed that investor accounts totalled 65bn. The trades were fictitious no securities were ever bought or sold. But seen as a respected elder statesmen with a Midas touch Madoff was able to burn thousands of investors including Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel director Steven Spielberg actor Kevin Bacon baseball legend Sandy Koufax and businessman Fred Wilpon as well as retired prison officers teachers and dentists. Many were Jewish many lived in Florida. Berlinger says At the end of the day hes a financial serial killer and the reason I say that is serial killers dont have empathy. Theres no way you can look a widow in the eye at the Palm Beach country club and assure them that their life savings will be fine give me your funds Ill take care of you and then do that to people. Hes somebody who lacks empathy therefore cant be remorseful. All the while Madoff and his wife were living the high life. They owned a luxury apartment in Manhattan an 11m estate in Palm Beach a 4m home on the tip of Long Island and a home in the south of France. They also enjoyed private jets and a yacht. Like another boy from Queens Donald Trump Madoff had elbowed his way into the Manhattan elite. Berlinger adds Of course greed was some element but I dont think he was blinded by greed. Hes a poor kid from Queens who longingly looked over the river towards Manhattan wanted to be a big player and just loved being the guy being successful. One of the reasons the Ponzi continued and got ramped up on steroids is his legitimate business was starting to fail and so he used that Ponzi money to shore up his legitimate business because he wanted to be Mr Wall Street. Ego and a sense of belonging to the big club of rich fellas that run the world. It was less about greed and more about status and position. Madoff claimed he acted alone but the film highlights his big four investors including Jeffry Picower a Florida philanthropist who made more money from the Ponzi scheme than Madoff himself. Picower was found dead in a swimming pool at his mansion in Palm Beach in 2009. His widow later agreed to return 7. 2bn. Madoff outfoxed regulators. He also weathered economic storms in the 1990s and the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. But he was finally undone by the financial crisis of 2008 when banks that had made reckless bets on mortgagebacked securities collapsed and investors scrambled to pull money out of the stock market. Spooked investors also started making withdrawals from Madoffs investment fund but he ran out of money to give them. While his books said his fund was worth 64bn most of that money did not exist. Berlinger says The scariest thing of all to me in this story is that nobody brought him down. Regulators missed it. People who are very sophisticated investors who should have known better who should have known that a conservative option strategy cant produce those kinds of results didnt ask the right questions. None of that brought Bernie down. What brought Bernie down was a black swan event the financial crisis. And I believe if the markets had just gone in their normal cycles he might still be doing it today. Knowing the game was up Madoff held a meeting with his sons and admitted his business was all just one big lie. A lawyer for the family contacted regulators who alerted federal prosecutors and the FBI. Madoff was arrested in December 2008 and became the focus of public fury over the wider financial meltdown. He was sentenced to 150 years in prison after pleading guilty in 2009 to fraud and other charges. He died while incarcerated at age 82 in 2021. His ashes remain in a box in a lawyers office because the family refused to receive them. One of Madoffs sons Mark killed himself on the second anniversary of his fathers arrest in 2010. Madoffs other son Andrew died from cancer at 48 he had got better in 2003 but blamed the stress of his fathers crimes for its return. Madoffs brother Peter was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2012 despite claims he was in the dark about his brothers misdeeds. In February last year Madoffs sister and her husband were found dead in an apparent murdersuicide. A trustee was appointed to recover funds and to date has returned about 70 of lost funds to investors. But questions persist over regulation and oversight. JP Morgan Chase which served as Madoffs bank for more than 20 years came to a 2bn settlement with government agencies over its relationship with him. Berlinger remains sceptical JP Morgan Chase heres a checking account with billions of dollars going through. If this was an account with a Mexican name on it they would assume its drug cartel money and every 10000 transaction would be analysed and there would be suspicious activity reports. Its Bernie Madoff Were not going to worry about it. I dont think JP Morgan knew there was a Ponzi scheme going on but I certainly think they knew something was not right and they just chose to ignore. Everyone chooses to ignore. That wider culpability to me is a story that nobodys really pulled together to provide this picture of the immense collapse of any kind of oversight and regulation that should have happened. Senior SEC officials were grilled by Congress with members of both parties asserting that Madoffs fraud exposed systemic problems. The SEC made rule changes including in how the agency carries out inspections of investment advisers and brokerage firms. However Berlinger draws parallels with cryptocurrency entrepreneur Sam BankmanFried 30 awaiting trial on charges that he swindled investors and looted customer deposits on his FTX trading platform. I feel people should take more responsibility for their personal finance understand where their money is and understand that this can happen again. And guess what It just did with FTX and Sam BankmanFried. Not that thats a Ponzi scheme but the similarities are striking. You had a charismatic guy who just talked and talked and people believed without actually looking into the details. You had very sophisticated investors taking other peoples money and giving it to FTX where FTX then used it to shore up its failing hedge fund. Those people who are taking innocent peoples money and giving it to somebody to invest should have known better. Just like with Madoff the regulatory oversight was nonexistent in part because thats a fundamental problem with crypto that has to be fixed. There was more oversight in place to deal with Bernie than oversight in place to deal with crypto so its not an apples to apples comparison but in some ways it is. Regulators should have known better and innocent people suffered. Madoff The Monster of Wall Street is now available on Netflix,2023-01-04T08:01:12Z
5,Madoff: The Monster of Wall Street review – grubby and jaw-dropping from start to finish,"This pacy Netflix docu-series plays like a Hollywood thriller, with its trail of grimly fascinating testimonies and astonishing curveballs about the ‘financial serial killer’It’s 1992 and business is booming on the 19th floor of the Lipstick Building in midto…",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/04/madoff-the-monster-of-wall-street-netflix-review-grubby-and-jaw-dropping-from-start-to-finish,Its 1992 and business is booming on the 19th floor of the Lipstick Building in midtown Manhattan. Here Wall Street statesman Bernie Madoff presides over his riskless trading empire. The man is revered as a magician a god of finance renowned for being almost allknowing about the market. A warm family atmosphere exudes from his immaculate offices up and down which Madoff is known to parade with a cigar clamped between his lips swivelling a computer monitor back into position if he deems it an inch askew. No plants or photo frames are permitted on desks. The colour scheme replicated in Madoffs private jet must be adhered to like the man. Yes its true that he can be a brutal controlling bully but hes also a kind generous brilliant family man. You get the drift. This is how the myths of such men are spun. Just once on a serious documentary such as Madoff The Monster of Wall Street Netflix Id love a talking head to say He wasnt an evil genius. He was a nasty mediocre morally bankrupt dangerous arsehole. Maybe next time. Two floors down is another business. Madoffs secret unregistered investment advisory firm born in the early years of his career and dodgy from the outset. No trades take place here. Madoff takes the money promises a return then gives it to someone else. Its a Ponzi scheme and by the time the games up more than a decade later itll be worth a staggering 64bn. Here fake paper trails and computer systems are created by workingclass highschool graduates groomed from a young age to do Madoffs dirty work. In stark contrast to the 19th floor its a mess of paper mid1980s computers dot matrix printers filing cabinets and an area known as The Cage where according to one anonymous ex17th floor employee everything was going down. Holy shit is a former FBI agents response as they recall the moment in 2008 when his team stormed the building and the scale of the biggest criminal enterprise in the history of Wall Street was revealed. It was like walking into a time warp. And yet everyone turned a blind eye for decades. Madoff The Monster of Wall Street is full of such grimly fascinating details. Joe Berlingers pacy fourparter treats the jawdropping story as a financial thriller which makes sense. All the elements are here from Madoffs humble beginnings growing up in Queens NY as the grandson of Jewish immigrants to his death in prison at the age of 82 while serving a 150year sentence. And its right that this deep dive is more concerned with the how than the why. After all this system which was powered by profit and greed might not have made the monster but it sure allowed him to grow. The access is impressive. Everyone is here from Madoffs secretary to my favourite character Harry Markopolos the classic gumshoe in this case a financial analyst. It took Markopolos less than five minutes to figure out that Madoff by this point operating as a secret hedge fund manager was running a Ponzi scheme. He harassed the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC for nearly a decade firing off emails with such subject lines as The worlds largest hedge fund is a fraud. The SEC on whose advisory committees Madoff often sat did next to nothing. I realised I was at personal risk says Markopolos on learning that Madoff was managing money for some of the worlds most dangerous people and prestigious banks. I started carrying a gun and checking my vehicle for bombs. Its all very entertaining what with the New York Stock Exchangestyle display graphics running along the bottom of the screen slowmo actor reenactments and requisite shots of apoplectic brokers on the trading floor. But I think Im done with being entertained by the true crimes of unaccountable men. At least Madoff The Monster of Wall Street gives due voice to the victims whose stories are so often overlooked in white collar crimes. Like the Jewish community of Palm Beach on whom Madoff preyed for years. Did people trust him more because he was Jewish asks Rabbi Leonid Feldman. The answer is yes. It was inconceivable that one of their own would defraud them. But this is the world of finance not some satisfying Hollywood thriller. Though Madoff was handed to the SEC on a silver platter for years once astonishingly by himself it was his sons who turned him in. Perhaps the grubbiest detail of all is the fact that it was the financial crash of 2008 that finally put a stop to a man described here as a financial serial killer. All the institutions did whether government regulators or banks was enable him. If the crash hadnt happened Madoff might still be operating today. Who knows how many others have since risen to take his place What an indictment.,2023-01-04T14:57:50Z

Theres some Mazinger a pinch of Evangelion a dash of GoLion a sprinkle of Tetsujin 28. I think the story is so well written that it can be for everyone but if youre a fan of the mecha genre youre really gonna get a kick out of it As you can tell the artist is a big fan of the new comics inspiration.
