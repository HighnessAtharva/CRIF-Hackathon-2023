1,Sensual ASMR has boomed on YouTube — but creators are facing a crackdown,"Sensual ASMR, a subgenre of the popular ASMR video and audio genre, is an established niche on YouTube. But the platform has cracked down on creators.",https://www.theverge.com/23512732/sensual-asmr-youtube-creators-demonetization,Dev Ritchie vividly remembers the first time she experienced ASMR a feeling of wellbeing combined with a tingling sensation in the scalp and down the back of the neck often experienced in response to sound. She was sitting in a cafe with a friend who had told Ritchie she wanted to show her something. Ritchie allowed her companion to place a headphone earbud in each of her ears closed her eyes and listened to the barbershopbased ASMR video her friend had discovered. Her whole body tingled. Instantly she was hooked. She wasnt alone. According to ASMR University there are roughly 500000 ASMR an abbreviation of autonomous sensory meridian response channels and 25 million ASMR videos on YouTube alone and the hashtag asmr has attracted more than 460 billion views on TikTok. Creators in the space create soundbased content designed to elicit the sensation of ASMR in viewers often attracting millions of views in the process. The niche involves the recording of specific sounds often things like tapping or clicking in striking detail through the use of microphones. The ASMR niche has given way to a wide range of vloggers who cater to specific themes like electronic restoration and even barbershop experiences. Ritchie who now creates her own ASMR content occupies one of its most controversial subgenres a genre whose creators dub it sensual ASMR. Videos in the niche often involve the sounds of sexually charged licking kissing and wet massages all amplified by the use of microphones. Sensual ASMRs popularity pales in comparison to traditional ASMR Ritchies most viewed video HOT Step sister gives you HJ ASMR has 1. 5 million views while the most viewed ASMR video on YouTube has 407 million. But its appeal is undeniable. Ritchie alone has attracted more than 70000 subscribers under the name GanjaGoddess by releasing clips with titles like Boob Massage ASMR HOT Teacher PUNISHES You ASMR and Moaning and Dirty Talk ASMR. ASMR videos with audio sexual sounds may be agerestricted or removed from the platform. Clearly there is an audience for the content that Ritchie creates but YouTube doesnt see the appeal in her line of work. A year ago Ritchie received a message that explained her videos had been demonetized due to their sexual nature. Since then the platform has redoubled its efforts to combat the spread of sensual ASMR. In its September 7th policy change announcement YouTube stated that it had strengthened our policies to better identify and action ASMR content that is sexually gratifying adding that ASMR videos with audio sexual sounds may be agerestricted or removed from the platform. Ritchie like many other creators in her niche is worried her videos could all be deleted. Sensual ASMR videos have an undeniable raunchy component but raunchiness is also a spectrum purging anything that might be sexually titillating from YouTube would mean removing all kinds of scenes from mainstream films or television. And many creators argue that they arent purely about sex. Former modelturnedASMR vlogger Elcee Orlova feels that the mantras she utters in her videos which are usually proclamations of love care and affection aimed at those watching her clips are what keep people coming back for more. I get comments like Thank you for your video. No one has ever told me those things in my entire life and Watching your videos makes me feel a bit less lonely recounts Orlova who declined to share her age and location with The Verge for privacy reasons. She has attracted more than 40000 subscribers on her YouTube channel ASMR GIRLFRIEND where she uploads videos with titles like ASMR Girlfriend Gives You A VERY WET Massage and ASMR Girlfriend Measures You and Finds Out Your Size. I believe my videos can help those people feel cared for she adds and appreciated for who they are. Ritchie has similar feelings about her work. Theres a lot of people out there whether they want to admit it or not that are having a lot of issues with loneliness. I call myself their egirlfriend she says. I take the time to talk to them I tell them things and I care about them. Thats going to make them feel better. Theres a lot of people out there... that are having a lot of issues with loneliness. In the eyes of ASMR creators the content they offer up isnt inherently sexually explicit or in violation of YouTubes policies. Its all built around the power of suggestion and is often used to entice prospective clients who might want to view their more Xrated work. Most of the traction that I get through YouTube I use to just funnel into OnlyFans. Its like a billboard that I kind of get paid for. Like Now that you see what my tongue can do come watch me do other things with it explains Kaitlyn Siragusa a 28yearold sensual ASMR content creator and streamer from Texas who has amassed more than 8 million Twitch and YouTube followers under the name Amouranth. I dont know any girls who only do sensual ASMR she adds. Theyre always doing harder stuff on the side. The reluctance of ASMR creators to explicitly label their content as sexual is understandable in the context of YouTubes policies. The platform does not allow sexual content if its primary purpose is sexual gratification nor any content that involves the depiction of sexual acts or fetishes that are meant for sexual gratification. Its policies also clearly state that links to websites that violate those guidelines like sexually explicit OnlyFans pages for example are not allowed. It doesnt help that ASMR has often been classed as a fetish although creators in all of its niches vehemently deny that this is the case. Admitting that their ASMR content is designed to be sexually gratifying or used to promote Xrated content could mean that creators risk their videos being banned or their accounts being deleted. How YouTubes rules should apply to sensual ASMR is up for debate and YouTube didnt return a request for comment on the policy before publication. Creators in this space rely on the art of suggestion. Their videos are not visually sexually explicit and the reality of whats occurring whether it be the licking of an earshaped microphone or the squelching of offscreen macaroni is not necessarily sexually gratifying. YouTubes enforcement of such policies is also blurry. Clips of someone called Fetish Pixie spitting in front of a mirror as well as spitting compilations of TikTokers are available on the platform as well as videos that feature women sucking on each others toes or women being tickled while tied up BDSMstyle. Like sensual ASMR none of it depicts sex but its widely recognized as sexually charged. Not everyone feels that YouTubes regulations are a bad thing. To be honest with you I actually support YouTubes decision regarding ASMR videos that exist solely for sexual arousal like kissing and licking the microphone says Orlova. If someone wants to enjoy that kind of content they can easily switch from YouTube to some other sexrelated platform and watch the videos there. Others blame an increasingly competitive social media ads market which has come to a grinding halt this year after years of growth. I think a lot of its a rat race now. Theres so many places people can advertise Facebook Twitch Snapchat YouTube says Siragusa. The advertising market is getting so saturated now from all these different platforms. I think its a race to the bottom for who can be the most advertiserfriendly platform that people go to. But Ritchie thinks that the popularity of ASMR has made it an easy scapegoat for YouTube which is frequently under pressure to purge the site of nonfamilyfriendly videos. The space for nudity and sexual content online is shrinking. Dr. Carolina Are an innovation fellow at Northumbria Universitys Center for Digital Citizens and expert in online moderation and the censorship of nudity points to the influence of FOSTASESTA a US act designed to curb online sex trafficking making the hosting of sexual content riskier. The space for nudity and sexual content online is shrinking and this is massively worrying not just for sexual expression but also education she explains. Overthetop policies from social media giants have already left safesex educators struggling to disseminate information and has even led to the development of algospeak due to the censorship of words like lesbian and BDSM which entrenches the idea that sexuality and fetish are taboo things best left undiscussed. It feels like an incredibly patronizing puritan move Are continues. Like platforms are trying to regulate peoples lives and choices. Are also warns that YouTube may not make the distinctions Orlova does between sensual and nonsensual ASMR. Its going to bleed onto creators that make nonsexual content anyway because this is what happens with these specific policies she says. FOSTASESTA for example has already led to the inadvertent silencing of queer adult comic artists. This is very worrying because it means platforms can decide which type of content becomes obsolete or wrong at the flick of a switch. Companies it seems are mostly at that point. Most social media platforms practice stringent policies around sexual content Instagrams famed opposition to the female nipple in all of its forms Tumblrs porn ban and OnlyFans almostdecision to remove sexual content creators from its platform are just three examples of social medias sexual sanitation era and toeing the line between suggestive and unacceptable content becomes harder every month. Its left creators feeling frustrated. I just feel like people should be able to enjoy what they want to enjoy says Siragusa. If listening to girls lick and spit on microphones makes them feel less lonely I dont see a problem with that.,2022-12-20T15:10:00Z,How to Avoid Copyright Strikes on Private and Unlisted YouTube Videos,Extremely Negative,420,"['inconvenience', 'warning', 'strike', 'issue', 'issues', 'impossible', 'issues', 'warning', 'strike', 'warning', 'warning', 'strike', 'error', 'falls', 'complicated', 'denied', 'denied', 'limited', 'limits', 'hard']",[],"[David, Gewirtz, 'lawsuit']"
2,"Seattle Schools Sue TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube Over Students' Mental Health","Seattle’s public school district is suing Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, and their parent companies.

The lawsuit filed on Friday in a U. S. District Court alleges that these social media sites have been a primary factor in a youth mental health crisis and that these platforms have knowingly exploited manipulated and targeted young people for profit at the expense of their mental heath. The district argues in its 91page complaint that tech giants have intentionally engineered addicting platforms cashed in on the vulnerability of stilldeveloping brains and algorithmically suggested harmful content to young users. Ultimately the school district is blaming these social media companies for the increase in mental health and behavioral issues that teens are showing up to classrooms with which has rendered the task of educating more difficult according to the suit. District officials point to a 30 increase in selfreported feelings of sadness and hopelessness among the student body as well as a rise in student suicide plans and attempts between 2010 and 2018. In an effort to manage those challenges the school district says it has had to take expensive actions like hiring more mental health counselors creating curriculum surrounding social media and mental health adjusting and enforcing school policies surrounding social media use and increasing disciplinary resources. However even all of these changes havent been enough to manage. Plaintiff cannot keep up with the increased need for mental health services because of the youth mental health crisis the lawsuit claims. So the Seattle schools are seeking accountability for social media platforms and meaningful change in how these companies operate along with damages and compensation. In past similar cases tech companies have used Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as a legal shield. Under the law digital publishers are not responsible for thirdparty content posted on their platforms i. e. Meta is not liable for anything its users post on Instagram and Facebook. However the Seattle case aims to get around this fundamental protection by targeting the design of social media sitesnot their content. The school district is claiming the increasing incentives to spend more and more time scrolling and the algorithms that dictate what users see causes harm toonot just whats in the posts. Defendants have maximized the time usersparticularly youthspend on their platforms by purposely designing refining and operating them to exploit the neurophysiology of the brains reward systems to keep users coming back coming back frequently and staying on the respective platforms for as long as possible says the complaint. Some psychology research along with both internal and external reports on social media company practices seem to support many of the new lawsuits claims. Studies have shown for instance that social media use and increased smartphone use may be linked to sleep depravation and accompanying depression. A Pew 2022 analysis found that more than half of teenagers surveyed would have a hard or very hard time giving up social media. Metas own internal research suggested that Instagram is toxic to some teen users particularly girls as it cultivates and amplifies body image issues. And Facebook has known for years that its algorithms boost time spent on its site to users detriment. However its very difficult to establish a direct link between increased social media use and worsened mental health because there are so many variables involved in mental health. And many experts dispute the use of the term addiction as applied to social media platforms altogether. This isnt the first attempt to sue social media companies for alleged mental health or youth harms in the U. S.. However past suits have mostly focused on individual cases. For instance the mother of a 10year old who died in 2021 sued ByteDance over allegations that a TikTok challenge caused her childs death. And in April the mother of a Wisconsin 17year old who died by suicide sued Meta and Snapchat for knowingly and purposely creating harmful and addicting products. The FTC has forced Fortnite to change its interface design so as to be less deceptive and fined Epic Games half a billion dollars. California legislators even tried to pass a bill banning addictive social media and explicitly making tech companies liable for every resulting violation involving children. The bill failed but more than 30 states currently have some sort of proposed or pending legislation aimed at regulating social media. Gizmodo reached out to Meta Instagram and Facebooks parent company Alphabet Google and Youtubes parent company TikTok owned by ByteDance Inc. and Snapchat owned by Snap Inc. for comment. We want teens to be safe online wrote Metas head of global safety Antigone Davis in a response statement emailed to Gizmodo. Davis statement cited tools the company has developed to support teen and families like age verifications parental controls and notifications encouraging breaks. Further it read we dont allow content that promotes suicide selfharm or eating disorders and of the content we remove or take action on we identify over 99 of it before its reported to us. Though past cases like the death of 14year old Molly Russell in the U. K. have demonstrated that harmful content like selfharm promotion does slip through the cracks. In the lead up to her suicide Russell interacted with more than 2000 Instagram posts relating to selfharm suicide and depression. A Google spokesperson too responded by highlighting the efforts he said the company has taken to make its platforms safer for children and teenslike screen time reminders and content blocks. TikTok and Snapchat did not immediately respond.,2023-01-09T17:17:00Z,Sensual ASMR has boomed on YouTube — but creators are facing a crackdown,Generally Neutral,3220,"['tingling', 'tingled', 'controversial', 'pales', 'worried', 'lonely', 'issues', 'loneliness', 'issues', 'loneliness', 'violation', 'reluctance', 'violate', 'vehemently', 'deny', 'risk', 'blurry', 'bad', 'blame', 'scapegoat', 'worrying', 'struggling', 'bleed', 'worrying', 'obsolete', 'wrong', 'stringent', 'opposition', 'unacceptable', 'frustrated', 'lonely', 'problem']","['sexually', 'Boob', 'Dirty', 'sexual', 'sexual', 'sexually', 'sexual', 'sexually', 'sex', 'sexually', 'sexual', 'sexual', 'sexual', 'sexual', 'sexual', 'sexually', 'fetish', 'sexually', 'sexually', 'sexually', 'Fetish', 'Pixie', 'sex', 'sexually', 'sexual', 'sexual', 'sex', 'sexual', 'sexual', 'sexual', 'lesbian', 'fetish', 'taboo', 'queer', 'adult', 'sexual', 'nipple', 'porn', 'sexual', 'sexual', 'spit']","[Dev, Ritchie, Ritchie, Ritchie, Ritchie, 'lawsuit', 'harassment', Ritchie, 'harassment', 'harassment', Ritchie, Elcee, Orlova, Orlova, Ritchie, Kaitlyn, Siragusa, 'harassment', 'harassment', 'harassment', 'harassment', 'harassment', Fetish, Pixie, 'harassment', Orlova, Ritchie, 'harassment', Carolina, Are, 'harassment', 'harassment', 'harassment', Are, 'harassment', 'lawsuit', 'harassment', 'harassment', Siragusa]"
