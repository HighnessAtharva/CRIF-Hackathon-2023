Netflix will stream a live awards show for the first time,"Netflix will air a live awards show for the first time, marking the streamer's latest expansion into live programming and further cementing its influence in Hollywood.",2023-01-11T15:42:57Z,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/11/business/netflix-sag-awards/index.html,Netflix will air a live awards show for the first time marking the streamers latest expansion into live programming and further cementing its influence in Hollywood. Beginning in the Screen Actors Guild Awards will be livestreamed globally on Netflix as part of a new multiyear partnership. The awards show previously aired on cable television on TNT since which is also owned by CNNs parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. The awards honor the best performances in film and television and are voted on by the more than members of the guild. Theyre typically less extravagant and watched by fewer people than awards shows like the Oscars and Golden Globes. The SAG Awards are beloved by the creative community and viewers alike and now even more fans around the world will be able to celebrate these talented actors said Bela Bajaria Netflixs head of global TV in a statement. This years th Annual SAG Awards will stream live for the first time on Netflixs YouTube channel on Sunday February at pm ET. Nominees for the upcoming awards are being announced Wednesday. Its not the first awards show to jump from traditional TV to streaming. The Academy of Country Music Awards switched from CBS to Amazons Prime Video in and will once again stream live on the service this year. Netflix NFLX is slowly exploring airing live events on the platform The companys first live event will be a Chris Rock standup special airing on March at pm ET. Adding live events could help Netflix NFLX stand out against rivals as it fights to keep adding subscribers in an increasingly crowded market. As weve long said we operate in a highly competitive industry where people have many different entertainment choices from linear TV to streaming YouTube to TikTok and gaming to social media Netflix wrote in its most recent earnings report. The silver lining is that the opportunity is very large and growing. Netflix however has so far resisted embracing certain live events including sports which are notoriously expensive to acquire. The economic models that are built around live sports are built around the economics of pay television which are different than streaming said Ted Sarandos Netflix coCEO last month at an investor conference. Were not antisports were just proprofits.

You Can Watch 'Kaleidoscope' Episodes in Any Order. A Complete Guide - CNET,"There are 40,000 ways to watch the innovative heist show on Netflix, but which is best?",2023-01-05T17:59:00Z,https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/you-can-watch-kaleidoscope-episodes-in-any-order-a-complete-guide/,Netflixs Kaleidoscope is familiar in many ways. Its a heist story that comes with many traditional beats old grudges team assembly smaller missions that set up for the big one. But theres one key way Kaleidoscope differs from similar shows you mightve seen. You can watch the episodes in any order. The series dropped Jan. and is the No. TV show on Netflix right now. Without giving too much away Giancarlo Esposito plays Ray Vernon aka Leo Pap the ringleader of a group plotting a multibilliondollar job while settling an old score. Every episode tells a chunk of the story focusing on Vernons motivations or the planning of the heist or what unfolds in the aftermath. The segments come in whichever random order Netflix decides to deliver them to you with the exception of the actual heist serving as the final episode. This isnt the first time Netflix has experimented with nonlinear storytelling. In Black Mirror Bandersnatch offered a chooseyourownadventure take on a film about a computer programmer. The following year viewers got to make decisions for adventurer Bear Grylls in You vs. Wild. Kaleidoscopes episodes are named for different colors no doubt a nod to the series name but also a way to easily track what order youre watching and compare with friends. You arent obligated to watch the way Netflix suggests. Heres what you need to know about how to watch Kaleidoscope. And if youve powered through and need some help sorting out what happened heres the ending explained. Do I need to pick an order Not necessarily. If you hit play on the show youll see a quick primer on how it works and then launch straight into the episodes. They can come in any order with the exception of White which is the heist itself and is structured to be the series finale. That said if you want to pick an order for yourself you can. How do I watch it chronologically In the spirit of the show Im going to skimp on episode descriptions as not to spoil anything. If you decide to watch Kaleidoscope chronologically the episode order goes like this starting with a young Vernon years before the heist Violet years before the heist. Green years before. Yellow weeks before. Orange weeks before. Blue days before. White the heist. Red the morning after. Pink months after. If you decide to go this route however know that any big finale twists will hit in the White episode. Are there other ways to watch If everyone has been doing the math correctly seven episodes with no repeats that can be watched in any order should yield more than options there are even more options if you dont watch White last. How many of those watch orders you want to try is between you and your calendar. Netflix tweeted some order suggestions if youre interested in watching Kaleidoscope as a Quentin Tarantino film ostensibly a reference to nonlinear Tarantino films like Pulp Fiction Blue Green Yellow Orange Violet Pink White Red or like a classic detective story Orange Green Violet Red Yellow Blue White Pink. You could go rogue and follow the colors of the rainbow Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Violet Pink. Or you could start with the big heist right off the bat if youre feeling particularly rebellious. What are viewers suggesting on social media Unsurprisingly lots of folks are talking about the episode order they chose and which order is the best. How did you watch it person writing this article How thoughtful of you to ask. My order as dictated by Netflix was Green. Yellow. Violet. Orange. Blue. Red. Pink. White. Oddly enough my best friends Netflix account gave her this exact order. For me this approach got off to a strong start but having Orange and Blue and then Red and Pink meant two sets of episodes in chronological order with relatively small time jumps in between. In that section I could feel my attention waning somewhat. Watching this show chronologically feels like missing the point. If I could go back and watch in a different order Id bump up Red but leave Pink where it is and flip Yellow and Green as I think Yellow would be the strongest episode to start. So like this Yellow. Green. Violet. Orange. Red. Blue. Pink. White.

Now the tech giant is finally rolling out the feature with the rest of the January security updates for its flagship devices. In the list of changes arriving with the package Google included spatial audio support for all Pixel Pixel Pro Pixel and Pixel Pro devices running Android. Spatial audio simulates an environment that makes users feel as if sounds are coming at them from different directions sort of like the surround sound effect in movie theaters. As Android Police notes it mostly became popular in mobile after Apple brought the feature to the AirPods Pro. Google started introducing code for it with the Android beta released in September but disabled it upon that betas stable release. Now the feature has officially been enabled. According to toGoogle the company previously said that users can take advantage of spatial audio on the Pixel phone with movies from Netflix YouTube Google TV and HBOMax that have. or higher audio tracks. Users however must wear headphones or earbuds to be able to enjoy the immersive experience. In addition to activating the feature on Pixel devices Google is also working on bringing head tracked spatial audio to the Pixel Buds Pro that will provide users with another layer of immersion so long as the earbuds are connected to any of the aforementioned Pixel phones. The company says it will release another update for the earbuds that will enable head tracking in the coming weeks.
Copenhagen Cowboy review â€“ Nicolas Winding Refnâ€™s scattershot Netflix series,"The hit-and-miss Drive director brings some spellbinding visuals to a new six-part thriller but struggles to make what counts for a plot feel quite as arrestingWith his latest project Copenhagen Cowboy, it would seem that film-maker Nicolas Winding Refn â€“ goiâ€¦",2023-01-03T14:49:36Z,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/03/copenhagen-cowboy-review-nicolas-winding-refn-netflix-series,With his latest project Copenhagen Cowboy it would seem that filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn going by NWR more and more as of late for ease of consistent and concise branding faces a pivotal juncture on multiple fronts. Back in his native Denmark for the first time since working under the constraints of Covid settling into a streaming miniseries period thats taken him from Amazon to Netflix and having recently turned years old he has reached the point at which most artists might conduct a personal inventory and evolve in some meaningful way as a consequence of it. The generous read of his careers flattened arc posits that having not done this is a testament to the clarity and force of his polarizing yet inarguably singular vision. With unflagging confidence in his style and pet themes hes muscled through every reason to change and held fast to his Serbian gangsters Thai martial artists terse avenging angels POV insert shots of hands and abandoned rave lighting schemes of lurid neoncharged color. The less charitable take would counter that Refns lockedin set of strengths and weaknesses doesnt agree with the sprawling run time of six hours which serves only to put more space between the flashes of frighteningly intense beauty that have placed him in the ranks of Aleague arthouse auteurs. At feature length as in his masterpiece Drive he can punctuate the long stretches of silent formalist glowering with jags of sadistic violence or arresting compositions at intervals frequent enough to hold an audience. But when untethered by any demands for concision he gives in to his tendency toward turgidity drawing out each installment with endless interludes of degree camera panning across a cast of wordless stoics. However diminishing Refns returns may be theyre littered with too many spellbinding moments to discount him completely even and especially because of this personal stagnation hes become a slipperier quantity to pin down his lingering talents at odds with his lack of interest in pushing them. Hes the same rascal the growth instead taking place in an audience conflicted about whether hes still worth the patience. Refns active disdain for the rhythms of serial television comes across in the loose string of actions that could be liberally defined as a plot engrossing on paper and nearinterminable in practice. Clad in an androgynous Finn Wolfhard haircut and a blue tracksuit she wears like Supermans Spandex our hero is Miu Angela Bundalovic ably playing the slatefaced cipher a living lucky charm with supernatural properties making her a valuable quantity to Denmarks criminal underground. Shes passed as chattel from one sinister creep to the next from a gangster matriarch hoping to get pregnant to another one of the blackmarket pornographers Refns so fond of to a family of Aryan psychopaths that may also have some vampiric DNA in the mix. Incredibly little of this plays as interesting on screen the pulpy subject matter sterilized by a glacial dourness that treats paperback thrills as a momentous clash between ancient good and evil. The notion that theres an elemental foundation to Mius parade of beatings a parallel track on the astral plane to her retributive warpath on Earth gains a canny visual representation only in the final episode during a fight that pairs each blow with a warped chopsocky sound effect bridging the gap between our dimension and the nonreal. Refn delivers something weve never seen before only after spending hours on more of the same a slog leavened by scant enjoyments Cliff Martinezs pulsating synthpop score exactly one dose of levity in the form of a calamitously incompetent coke deal attended by Refn himself in a cheeky cameo some devious visual equivalencies between humans and pigs. Though that last one is somewhat more difficult to appreciate once a person has read up about the onset incident in which one porcine actor was intentionally shot and killed. Refn has gone on record that the title has nothing to do with the content of the show confessing that the phrase Copenhagen Cowboy came to him before he started writing and adding that I just like the two words together. His creative logic really doesnt get much more complex than that the simple pursuit of whichever signifier in an increasingly warmedover sensibility of cool happens to tickle his fancy. With the backing of those famously permissive streamer executives he could very well spend the rest of his days pointing purple lights at chiseled torsos emblazoned with toughguy tattoos occasionally stumbling into a blink of transcendence. But hes also hinted at a homecoming to the cinema as his next move a welcome influence on his focus in its forced concision. Like the unstoppable Miu his unwieldy and unpredictable powers are most reliably activated under duress.

In comparison HBOs adsupported tier gained of the new signups when launched last year. Since its inception Netflix has been very firm in not bringing ads to the platform.

Thats a fairly major change from when many movies hit services like HBO Max on the same day as theaters. But if youve gotten used to catching up on everything on your couch dont worry theres still plenty to watch over the holidays. And be sure to check out our recommendations from last year which are still good I swear HBO Max Station Eleven Perhaps the best piece of media Ive seen this year Station Eleven is an adaptation of Emily St. Johns novel about a societycollapsing swine flu epidemic. Wait dont run away While the series may evoke the worst of our COVID experience at first it also transforms into a hopeful tale about the power of stories and pop culture and human connection. It delivers something we could all use right now Hope. Tuca and Bertie Season After being unceremoniously canceled by Netflix in the cartoon duo of Tuca and Bertie found a new home on Cartoon Network last year. The third and unfortunately final season of the series aired this year and it remains a delight. Created by Lisa Hanawalt and executive produced by Raphael BobWaksberg BoJack Horseman it follows a pair of friends as they deal with life love and simply existing in their s. Also on HBO Max The White Lotus Season Mike Whites series on the exploits of privileged resort guests this time in Sicily instead of Hawaii remains a delight. Harley Quinn Season This show remains one of the best DC series currently airing. Tune in for a comedic and more adult spin on your Batman faves. Disney Andor Yes its another Star Wars show but Andor ended up being one of the biggest surprises of the year. Created by Tony Gilroy who helped transform Rogue One into a stellar film it centers on Cassian Andor Diego Luna a smalltime thief with a healthy distrust for the Empire. The show follows his journey towards becoming a member of the rebels and in doing so it also serves as a blueprint for taking down authoritarian systems. Fire of Love Katia and Maurice Krafft were a rare couple two expert volcanologists who were also madly in love. They dedicated their lives to documenting active volcanoes often by directly confronting lava flows rock explosions and acid lakes. Fire of Love unearths their original footage to show just how far they went in the name of science. But it also paints a portrait of a truly rare couple one whose contributions we still owe much to. Also on Disney Tales of the Jedi A short animated series that gives us a bit more backstory on Ahsoka Tano and... Count Dooku If youve been interested in the Star Wars cartoons but dont want to slog through tons of old episodes this is a good start. Bluey This remains the best kids show on TV. Blueys latest season is as funny and poignant as ever. Its the rare show that can teach both kids and their parents. Netflix Cyberpunk Edgeunners Cyberpunk had a notoriously rocky game launch but the setting of Night CIty was always compelling. Edgerunners is an anime spin on that universe centering on a plucky street kid who finds himself equipped with a militarygrade spine implant. You know typical teenage stuff. Will his newfound power keep him on the wrong side of the law And will he ever get revenge against the people who ruined his life The show doesnt do much new but it features genuinely compelling characters and some of the best animation in recent years. The Midnight Club Mike Flanagan can do no wrong. The talent behind Midnight Mass Doctor Sleep and the excellent Haunting of horror shows on Netflix has now set his sights on a Christopher Pike adaptation and the results are glorious. The show cocreated by Leah Fong follows a group of terminally ill teenagers as they tell spooky stories and explore the supernatural mysteries of their hospice mansion. Its a meditation on the power of storytelling but also yet another Flanagan exploration of the value of life. Also on Netflix Wednesday Come to see Tim Burton finally get his shot at The Addams Family stay for Jenna Ortegas perfectly deadpan performance. Hulu The Bear Can an awardwinning chef truly come back home and save his familys beleaguered sandwich shop Or is he just trying to work through the death of his brother the only way he knows The Bear captures the energy and madness of kitchen life better than any TV show forget all the glossy stuff youve seen on Chefs Table. But amid the insanity its the story of a found family banding together to mourn and save the place they all love. The Dropout What makes Elizabeth Holmes tick This series which stars Amanda Seyfried as the notorious Theranos founder paints a more complete picture of Holmes than the HBO documentary The Inventor. We see Holmes early life as well as her initial connection with Sunny Balwani Naveen Andrews perhaps the best TV adaptation glowup any South Asian man can hope for. After proving her smarts in college she sets off to build the worlds best blood testing machine with Theranos. We all know how that went. When the hype around Theranos starts to fall apart The Dropout turns into a fascinating portrait of selfdeception. Also on Hulu Fleishman is in Trouble Toby Fleishman is going through a divorce. But as he starts to rebuild his own identity he also needs to deal with the wreckage of his marriage and find his missing exwife. Apple TV Severance Taking the idea of worklife balance a step too far Severance follows a group of people whove received a procedure that completely splits their memories between home and office life. The result is two completely separate personalities within the same body both trapped in their respective cages. Severance is a bit of a slow burn but its a fascinating exploration of corporate control akin to Terry Gilliams Brazil. Be sure to check out our interview with the creator of the show Dan Erickson on the Engadget Podcast. Pachinko An adaptation of Min Jin Lees novel Pachinko follows a Korean family across several generations starting in and reaching into the late s. We see a young fish seller fall in love and make her way to Japan as an outsider while her grandson struggles to maintain his identity in the pressurefilled business world. Pachinko has almost everything youd want in a family epic Children struggling to live up to their parents standards forbidden love and the constant threat of generational trauma. Also it has one of the best opening sequences of the year. Other things to watch The Good Fight Paramount Over its sixseason span The Good Fight tackled the insanity of our current social and political environment better than any other TV show. Its first and foremost a legal procedural but coming from the minds of Michelle and Robert King it ends up being so much more. Gangs of London AMC Now on its second season Gangs of London is one of the most brutal crime shows on TV. Its part gangster epic part martial arts smackdown it comes from Gareth Evans director of The Raid films. While the plot becomes increasingly ludicrous its worth a watch just for the sheer ambition of its action sequences many of which go far harder than anything weve seen in American films lately.
"No, Netflix isn't losing its meg-hit 'Wednesday' to Amazon","Speculation swirled online this week that ""Wednesday"" could leave Netflix, but there's no way that's happening.",2023-01-05T19:15:05Z,https://www.businessinsider.com/wednesday-is-not-leaving-netflix-for-amazon-heres-why-mgm-2023-1,No Netflix isnt losing its megahit Wednesday to Amazon Wednesday quickly became one of Netflixs biggest shows of all time after debuting in November. Speculation swirled online this week that the show could leave Netflix for Amazon. Netflixs Addams Family spinoff Wednesday is the streamers third mostwatched series ever based on time viewed within its first month. It garnered. billion hours behind just Squid Game and Stranger Things season four. So it would be quite shocking if the series left the streamer for another platform for its second season. Speculation has swirled online this week that it could do just that after a story from the The Independent posited that Netflix hadnt announced a second season for Wednesday yet because MGM which produced the series is now owned by Amazon meaning the show could move to an Amazon platform like Prime Video. But two people familiar with the matter told Insider that there is no truth to the report. One of the people said deals with MGM for Wednesday were made long before Amazon bought MGM in May for. billion. Indiewire also reported that the speculation was unfounded. We dont know the full extent of the agreement and perhaps there is wiggle room for AmazonMGM to try to modify the deal in place. But Netflix licenses other original shows that are produced by other parties based on everything we know it would be surprising to see Netflix let Wednesday slip through its fingers. Amazon is however rebranding Epix to MGM this year so some future MGMproduced content could wind up there or on Amazons own streaming service Prime Video. All of this is not even mentioning the fact that Netflix has never played by conventional TV standards and isnt always quick to renew a series just because its popular. Stranger Things for example was renewed for a fourth season two months after season three debuted. Wednesday premiered November give it time.

"Review: 'Matilda the Musical' isn't a miracle, but it is a lot of fun","Bringing vibrant energy to the translation from book to musical to screen, ""Roald Dahl's Matilda the Musical"" lands on Netflix as a rewarding example of the perilous practice of building such efforts around children.

Of course it helps that the young star Alisha Weir is terrific aided by wonderful turns from Emma Thompson and Lashana Lynch extending what have already been good years for both. Dahls story about a little girl with absentee parents and unusual powers sent to a boarding school run by the abusive kidhating Miss Trunchbull Thompson under a version of supervillain makeup is certainly dark even by the authors standards. But as adapted for the stage by Tim Minchin who wrote the songs and directed here by Matthew Warchus who has nicely opened up the staging in cinematic fashion its a polished and fun alternative to less attractive holiday activities like dealing with your family. Perhaps the silliest controversy involved questions about Thompson donning a fat suit when her Trunchbull makeover is as much about making her fearsome and imposing befitting the characters glory days as an Olympic athlete as her girth. Lest anyone forget Thompson also previously buried herself under unflattering prosthetics in Nanny McPhee and lustily portrayed a villain in Disneys Cruella. In a year when shes already delivered a standout performance in the lowkey Hulu movie Good Luck to You Leo Grande her scenestealing exploits offer a reminder of just how delicious she can be when cutting loose in this fashion. This isnt a school. Its a prison Matilda is told when she arrives at Crunchem Hall a foreboding establishment where the cruel headmistress sees her mandate as crushing kids not educating them. Fortunately the girl wins over friends with her defiant attitude and finds an adult ally in Miss Honey Lynch the mousy antithesis of her The Woman King role who immediately recognizes that Matilda is special. The song and dance numbers take full advantage of the wider template that movies allow with kids leaping in every direction on the centerpieces Revolting Children and Miracle as well as the more soulful When I Grow Up. To call Matilda miraculous would be taking things too far but the movie joins a long tradition of kidcentric musicals invariably turned into fodder for school plays from Oliver to Annie in a way that nicely bridges the gap between the movie and this musicinfused take. Mom says Im a good case for population control the mistreated Matilda sings early on. While the ranks of musicals brought to the screen probably does merit some family planning Matilda the Musical offers a sprightly demonstration that theres always room for another good one. Matilda the Musical premieres December on Netflix.
The End of Netflix Password Sharing Is Nigh,The end of password sharing is coming to Netflix soon -- and it will be a challenge for both viewers and the streaming giant.

Researchers inside Netflix identified password sharing as a major problem eating into subscriptions in people familiar with the situation say but the company was worried about how to address it without alienating consumers. Then Covid lockdowns hit bringing a wave of new subscribers and the effort to scrutinize sharing petered out. More than million Netflix viewers now watch the service using passwords they borrow often from family members or friends the company says. Netflix has said that it will put an end to that arrangement starting in asking people who share accounts to pay to do so. The company expects to begin rolling out the change in the U. S. early in the year. Netflixs crackdown risks squandering years of goodwill the company has built up over the years and angering consumers who have a crowd of other streaming services to choose from.

Netflix is gearing up to price tag on password sharing in 2023,Netflix appears to be moving ahead with a new monetization plan for those lending their account to people outside their household.,2022-12-23T23:18:59Z,https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-gearing-up-price-tag-password-sharing,Netflix is gearing up to price tag on password sharing in Would this sit well with people or drive them away What you need to know Netflix is looking to add an additional fee for those lending their passwords to a family member or friend. After testing in Latin America Netflix is looking to bring this idea to the U. S. market in early. The company reports there are million viewers watching Netflix off a borrowed account and many Latin American testers are not too happy with this change. Netflix is looking to bring an end to the current lifestyle of sharing an accounts password. According to the Wall Street Journal researchers from within the walls of Netflix are interested in solving its major passwordsharing problem in. The streaming platform states that there are million viewers of its content using a borrowed password. So to quell this Netflix will be ushering in an additional fee for those wishing to share their accounts with other people in in the U. S. Netflix has been testing this new way of sharing passwords in Latin America. For those users the company has allowed them to pay for sharing an account with up to two people who do not live in their homes. The borrower would then need to enter a verification code that Netflix would provide to the owner of the account before they can watch their show or movie. And this code would need to be entered within minutes before expiring. Netflix has also tested ways to get a handle on families that are split such as children visiting each adult figure separately. The running idea is to alert Netflix if they are going to be shifting their geographical location for any given period of time. Another issue the streaming platform has found comes from the Indian market. A person close to the matter states that with many people in India watching Netflix off of their phones its difficult to determine if they live in the same house as the account holder or not. Its a much easier bit of information to verify if they are streaming over WiFi or a wired connection instead. The Wall Street Journal cites Netflix CoCEO Ted Sarandos who said make no mistake I dont think consumers are going to love it right out of the gate. This would probably be true for U. S. viewers as well considering those in Latina America have already complained about this change. If you remember Netflixs Q earnings report this way of monetizing password sharing is basically its proposed subaccounts plan. It was back in October that Netflix brought up the idea of subaccounts which sounds exactly like what was being tested already in Latin America. Netflix said it has plans to bring it to the U. S. market in early although it has not detailed when it would launch or its pricing. To prepare for the eventual move Netflix recently made it a lot easier for password borrowers to transfer their Netflix account from their friendfamily member that actually held the account to their own account.

"'Glass Onion': Ending Explained, Celebrity Cameos You May Have Missed - CNET",Did you catch all the Beatles references in the Knives Out mystery on Netflix? And can richies really rent the Mona Lisa?,2023-01-05T23:03:00Z,https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/glass-onion-ending-explained-celebrity-cameos-you-may-have-missed/,Warning Spoilers for Glass Onion A Knives Out Mystery ahead. After a brief stint in theaters in November Glass Onion A Knives Out Mystery is streaming on Netflix. And this onion isnt making many people cry. Its earned a universal acclaim rating on Metacritic and a certified fresh rating of on Rotten Tomatoes and as of Tuesday its the No. most watched movie of all time on Netflix. Here are answers to some of the questions people are asking about the film its twistfilled ending and the celebrity cameos and other Easter eggs dropped along the way. Glass Onion ending explained Here come the spoilers. In a very Agatha Christie setup a group of friends gather on an isolated Greek island for a weekend getaway. Theyre staying at a mansion with a domed glass top dubbed the Glass Onion. Elon Muskesque billionaire Miles Bron Edward Norton has called the group of old friends together. Detective Benoit Blanc Daniel Craig finagles an invite and foils the fake murder Miles had set up for himself. But then the real murders appear to begin. Guntoting Duke Dave Bautista drinks from Miles glass and dies. And Miles former business partner Andi Janelle Monae appears to have been shot. Except the bullet lodged in a journal she was carrying and shes fine. But this is a twisty film and we soon learn Andi died before the island getaway supposedly by suicide. Her twin sister Helen kept Andis death under wraps and went on the trip pretending to be her twin to try to solve the murder. She hires Blanc to come along. Turns out everyone had a motive to kill Andi. She and Miles started a tech company Alpha based on a business strategy Andi sketched on a napkin at their favorite bar the Glass Onion. Miles copied the napkin sketch and pretended it was his idea and the others all lied in court to support his claim because he was helping them financially. But some time later Andi found her original napkin sketch which unlike the copy has the Glass Onions logo on its napkin. She stupidly alerted all the friends to her find and since they all lied in court against her they all have a reason to want her dead. The killer ends up being Miles of course who offed his expartner and tried to make it look like a suicide. Duke later told Miles he knew about the murder and that explains why Miles killed him by putting pineapple juice something Dukes allergic to in his drink. Apparently reactions to pineapple allergies can indeed be deadly. Miles manages to burn the allimportant napkin prompting an outraged Andi whos actually Helen to break all his glass statues with the other guests who secretly hate and resent Miles eventually joining in the destructionfest. Alphas big new product is a hydrogen fuel called Klear and Miles is pushing it despite knowing its dangerous. Andi left the company over this. Blanc gives the revengeminded Helen a chunk of Klear and she blows up the Glass Onion with it. That wouldnt be as big of a deal except Miles has somehow rented the Mona Lisa from Paris Louvre claiming the museum was closed due to COVID and France needed money yes thats how rich he is. The museum insisted the painting be behind fireproof glass but Miles installed an override saying he needs to look the painting in its eyes. Helen hits the override and we all get to watch the worlds most famous artwork melt. The last scene shows police boats streaming toward the island as all the other guests vow to turn on Miles now exposed as a doublemurderer and the man who destroyed the Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisas destruction is the one thing that finally gets to Miles who longed to be remembered forever in the same conversation as the painting. And... now he will be. Meanwhile director Johnson says he sees the Mona Lisa living on in Helen the woman who destroyed it but also the woman who found justice for her late sister. Glass Onion celebrity cameos The cast is starstudded with Kate Hudson Leslie Odom Jr. Kathryn Hahn Norton and Craig among the actors. But there are some fun cameos to watch out for. Among Us celebrity call Early on Blanc is seen in the bath playing Among Us with four buddies via an online call. Those buddies arent just regular people theyre actress Angela Lansbury basketball legend Kareem AbdulJabbar composer Stephen Sondheim and actress Natasha Lyonne. Sadly Lansbury and Sondheim have died since the movie was filmed. Serena Williams Hey if Miles can afford to rent the Mona Lisa in this world he can also afford to keep tennis icon Serena Williams on call as his virtual personal trainer. She shows up on a big video screen and tries to get Blanc to work out. Hugh Grant Hugh Grant doesnt have a big role but hes seen briefly as someone who answers the door at Blancs place partner friend. Like many others he apparently spent the pandemic in the kitchen baking. YoYo Ma Cellist YoYo Ma appears early on as a guest at a wild chichi party. His musical knowledge helps Kate Hudsons character Birdie figure out how to solve the puzzle box that contains her island invitation from Bron. Joseph GordonLevitt Actor Joseph GordonLevitt is heard but not seen. Miles has a clock of some kind that announces a musical bong every hour and GordonLevitt voices the word. Ethan Hawke Actor Ethan Hawke has a brief and odd scene as one of Brons employees. He squirts a magical COVID preventative or something into each guests mouth before they board a boat to go to the island allowing them to take off their masks and freeing up the plot from having to touch on pandemic precautions. Still there are plenty of references to the pando and how its kept everyone indoors for far too long. Where was the film shot Bron takes his friends to his supposed private island in Greece. Production designer Rick Heinrichs told Conde Nast Traveler those scenes were shot at a luxury resort called Amanzoe located near Porto Heli with other scenes filmed on the Greek island of Spetses. Maggie Gyllenhaals movie The Lost Daughter was also shot on Spetses. The films opening party scene was shot in Belgrade Serbia the films costume designer Jenny Eagan told Mens Health. And Heinrichs confirmed Serbia got a lot of Glass Onion love saying Anything set in New York or the Northeast was created in Serbia. Can rich people really rent the Mona Lisa In the film Miles Bron pays big bucks to Paris Louvre Museum to borrow the famed Mona Lisa painting. The yearold masterpiece has indeed left the Louvre at various times though not at the whim of a rich guy who wanted to hang it in his Greek pleasure palace. During World War II the French moved it around to a variety of places to protect it from the Nazis. Before that in it was stolen only to be found when one of the thieves attempted to sell it. The Mona Lisa also was exhibited in Washington DC and New York in at the request of thenFirst Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. In the director of the Louvre JeanLuc Martinez said the museum would not include the painting in a traveling exhibition of Frances masterpieces because it is just too fragile. But the painting does have a protective setup just like it does in Glass Onion. Since its been hanging inside a temperaturecontrolled box behind bulletproof glass. Glass Onion ice cream actually exists No really. Van Leeuwen Ice Cream made a Glass Onion ice cream flavor. You can buy it online to be shipped to you with dry ice. The flavor reflects the film by blending vanilla ice cream with Greek yogurt for the Greek setting honeycomb candy for a glassy crunch and a swirl of bourbon caramelized onion jam. Ive sampled it and while the onion smell is immediately upsetting the cookedin onions are so sweet that its... almost OK The Beatles connection to Glass Onion In the film glass onion refers to the giant glass dome on Miles Brons Greek mansion. Beatles fans of course know the title as a song from the bands famous White Album. Johnson knew he wanted a title relating to glass and told Deadline that when he searched the word glass in his phones music app the Beatles Glass Onion showed up and he was inspired. The song plays over the closing credits. But I was always surprised when I was showing the script around how many people didnt know it was a Beatles song Johnson said. I thought everybody knew Glass Onion but I guess they dont. Theres another Beatles reference. In Brons first scene hes attempting to play the bands song Blackbird on the guitar and claims the instrument hes using is the one on which Paul McCartney wrote that song. He then hugs Birdie and tosses the guitar carelessly to the beach while she looks horrified. Will there be a Glass Onion sequel Glass Onion itself is a sequel of sorts. Daniel Craigs detective character Benoit Blanc first appeared in s Knives Out though the rest of the cast is new. Netflix bought two sequels to Knives Out so expect another Blanc detective film probably with an entirely new cast to show up eventually. Director Rian Johnson told Deadline he knows hell need to keep the franchise fresh and not just rehash the first two films. Theres no release date or title yet.
The best Netflix original movies of 2022,"The best new Netflix movies, with great Netflix originals like Hustle with Adam Sandler, Guillermo del Toroâ€™s Pinocchio, and more great Netflix movies.",2022-12-26T17:00:00Z,https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23516874/best-netflix-original-movies-2022,Its been a great year in movies. Weve already gone over our picks for the best new movies of the year but not all of those are available to watch at home and many are spread across a litany of streaming services. Netflix released well over new movies in. Not all of them can be winners but these ones are. Here are the best new Netflix original movies that came out this year. Lost Bullet Genre Action thriller Run time h m Director Guillaume Pierret Cast Alban Lenoir a bunch of people who punch andor chase Alban Lenoir Lost Bullet rules and the second movie newly released on Netflix in November ups the ante to another degree. The chase scenes are even more actionpacked this time our superstar mechanic Lino adds electrified rods to the front of his car making him a sort of sickashell automotive jouster andor a mad scientist but for car chases and the fights are visceral Alban Lenoir throws so many hard right crosses in this movie and he receives just as many. It helps to have a lead who just looks like hes been in a few bar fights in his time and Lenoir delivers the exact kind of personality you need for this role. Throw in a sense of chaotic joy in making cars blow up in as many exciting ways as possible and you have Lost Bullet. Pete Volk Athena Genre Thriller Run time h m Director Romain Gavras Cast Sami Slimane Dali Benssalah Ouassini Embarek Athena is the very definition of a movie firing on every cylinder. Its truly impossible to separate out the best part of the movie is it the performances of Sami Slimane and Dali Benssalah as Karim and Abdel two brothers each struggling with their youngest brothers death The long tracking shots director Romain Gavras expertly utilizes to mount the tension in every scene The arch soundtrack Or maybe its just the beauty of every frame capturing a neighborhood in revolt intent on waging war against the police to make themselves heard. What works about Athena is how these things merge into a grander story like the cries of its rebels or the heavily armored police retaliating against them every little bit is part of a more momentous whole. While the movie has rightfully gotten attention for its singleshot sequences Gavras uses them to a beautiful end at once highlighting the chaos of the last stand and letting shared gazes of Karim and Abdel feel weighty with just a few cuts. In a lesser movie the nature of the drama would feel easier to stick in a neat box or thered be a clear moment that defines things. But in a feast like Athena expertly blending all its ingredients into something truly meaty nothing is simple. Revolution is messy and Athena understands that spill happens on both sides. This movie is all gas no brakes. A thrill ride and a Greek tragedy all in one. Zosha Millman Hustle Genre Sports drama Run time h m Director Jeremiah Zagar Cast Adam Sandler Juancho Hernangmez Queen Latifah Adam Sandler loves basketball. The tales of his pickup basketball exploits are legendary hes a huge Knicks fan and his work in Uncut Gems is the closest Ive ever seen to a filmic representation of what it feels like to root for a sports team you love in a highpressure situation. So who better to put together one of the best sports movies in years In Hustle Sandler plays a former college player who has had a long career as a scout for the ers with dreams of becoming a coach. When those dreams seem to be about to come true and then are suddenly dashed Sandlers Stanley Sugerman must find a generational prospect or risk losing his job. When he spots the young Bo Cruz played by real NBA player Juancho Hernangmez at a pickup game in Spain it seems his luck may finally be turning. Featuring a starstudded cast of movie stars and basketball stars alike Hustle is an ode to the joys and the struggles of basketball and of making your passion your job. Sandler is terrific in the lead role as are Hernangmez and NBA star Anthony Edwards in supporting roles. The movie also takes full advantage of the talent on display with thrilling basketball sequences utilizing the unbelievable skills of the cast. PV Guillermo del Toros Pinocchio Genre Fantasymusical Run time h m Directors Guillermo del Toro Mark Gustafson Cast Ewan McGregor David Bradley Gregory Mann Many bigname directors have tapped up Netflix to fund the projects they just couldnt get made elsewhere Guillermo del Toro turned to the streamer to greenlight this year passion project of his an unruly charming stunningly crafted stopmotion take on the thcentury Italian childrens story. It takes huge liberties with the source material relocating it in time to Mussolinis Italy and turning it into an antifascist parable about death rebirth and the joy of nonconformity. Its not a childrens movie but its not not one either like del Toros horror fables The Devils Backbone and Pans Labyrinth Pinocchio finds clarity on some very grownup concerns by viewing them from a childs perspective. Its del Toros best movie since those two as well moving personal richly imaginative and unlike anything else youve seen. Oli Welsh The Big Genre Action comedy Run time h m Director Timo Tjahjanto Cast Abimana Aryasatya Putri Marino Marthino Lio You know how movie trailers often advertise something as from the twisted mind of someone... not so twisted Timo Tjahjanto is the rare filmmaker that lives up to that label. The actionhorror maestro who brought us the Netflix masterpiece The Night Comes for Us turns his skills to the actioncomedy genre bringing together a wacky group of retired assassins who work together to solve the murder of their father figure. Its a setup not unlike another great Netflix movie The Paper Tigers but this one brings Tjahjantos particular wicked sense of humor into the fold. Your mileage may vary on the comedy but the fights in The Big are undeniable. Theyre visceral brutal filled with comedic beats and splashes of gore. Tjahjanto is one of the most exciting young filmmakers working today and The Big is one of many reasons to get excited for his upcoming Train to Busan remake. PV The Stranger Genre Thriller Run time h m Director Thomas M. Wright Cast Joel Edgerton Sean Harris Jada Alberts Thomas M. Wrights The Stranger is one of the years most beautifully shot and wellacted thrillers full stop. Sean Harris stars as Henry Teague an itinerant day laborer who inadvertently finds himself working alongside Mark Frame Joel Edgerton for an Australian criminal organization. Unbeknownst to Teague he is at the center of one of the largest manhunts in Western Australias history for being suspected of the brutal murder of a teenage boy several years prior. By turns both procedural and cerebral Wright thrusts the audience into a drama in which the leads are pitted against one another in a fraught catandmouse game where the stakes are both lawful and personal. From the dark dreamlike cinematography to Edgertons and Harris impeccably calibrated performances to composer Oliver Coates dark thrumming score The Stranger is an unnerving and engrossing thriller that holds you close and wont let go until the very end. Toussaint Egan Slumberland Genre Family Run time h m Director Francis Lawrence Cast Jason Momoa Marlow Barkley Chris ODowd Slumberland is a heartwarming visually rich production that boils Winsor McCays classic comic strip down to its essentials and builds it back up into something modern. Marlow Barkley plays Nemo with Jason Momoa as her Beetlejuicelike companion the disreputable Flip. Momoa plays the role with obvious gusto repurposing the physical presence of a superhero in physical comedy. But Slumberland never lets anything its wild vistas its intricate worldbuilding or its outsized personalities get in the way of its true center Nemo Flip and Nemos wet blanket of an uncle played by Chris ODowd. The colorful fantasy is just the kind of weirdness that could get happily stuck in the head of a creative young viewer for a very long time. Susana Polo Do Revenge Genre Comedy Run time h m Director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson Cast Camila Mendes Maya Hawke Austin Abrams Do Revenge is like Heathers and Mean Girls for a sharp black comedy about two girls with a quest for vengeance in an elite Miami high school. Its a great update to the very specific genre of hellbent teenage girls and like similar movies in the subgenre Do Revenge curates a specific aesthetic timely to its era. But what makes Do Revenge particularly memorable is how both fallen It Girl Drea Camila Mendes and new girl Eleanor Maya Hawke are incredibly vicious and watching their relationship turn from something inspired yay Women supporting women into something toxic and then mutate into something else entirely is just incredibly fun. Director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson smartly avoids turning the film into a moralizing statement about vengeance because at the end of the day were watching Do Revenge for the revenge Petrana Radulovic The School for Good and Evil Genre Fantasy Run time h m Director Paul Feig Cast Charlize Theron Kerry Washington Kit Young The School for Good and Evil Shrek and Enchanted but the fact that the heart of The School for Good and Evil is Agatha and Sophies friendship turns it from something cliche to something wonderful. PR The Sea Beast Genre Adventure Run time h m Director Chris Williams Cast Karl Urban ZarisAngel Hator Jared Harris After a run at Disney that included directing Big Hero and guiding Frozen WreckIt Ralph Zootopia and Moana Chris Williams jumped ship to Netflix. So far the streamers major coup has only resulted in this undertheradar animated flick which brings the epic adventure of How To Train Your Dragon to the seas and a political theme that may not pass muster at Disney. In a Victorianesque world populated with sea monsters Maisie Brumble ZarisAngel Hator dreams of sailing the high seas to avenge the death of her parents. So she sneaks aboard the Imperator the most valorous ship in the royal armada to accompany Jacob Holland Karl Urban on a hunt for the legendary Red Bluster. But what the two unlikely companions learn over the course of their adventure is that their target may not be as violent as it seems and that the Crown may not be on the right side of history. Williams with all the tools at his disposal spins action that any Dragon or Pirates of the Caribbean fan will flip for while not flinching in a dissection of the moral complexity of heroism and loyalty. The Sea Beast is a big fun allages movie even on a tinier TV screen. Matt Patches My Fathers Dragon Genre Adventure Run time h m Director Nora Twomey Cast Rita Moreno Judy Greer Adam Brody Its been a terrific year for Netflix animated features. Though My Fathers Dragon didnt make as big a splash as Guillermo del Toros Pinocchio or The Sea Beast and is a relatively minor work from the great studio Cartoon Saloon Wolfwalkers its still a touching enthralling adventure. Adapted from the very strange childrens classic by Ruth Stiles Gannett it tells the story of a boy who flees his new life in the city only to be transported by a talking cat to a wild island where the local animals have captured and enslaved a young dragon. Director Nora Twomey sensitively and smartly updates the material and finds a dimension of almost political allegory to the sinking island and its desperate animal inhabitants as well as a surprisingly epic scale.

It also brought layoffs top exec exits and structural changes to the company. Netflix may be remembered in for streaming hits like Wednesday and Ryan Murphys Monster The Jeffrey Dahmer Story but internally the company also underwent a dramatic reorganization in the past year. Top execs including former marketing chief Bozoma Saint John left the company and a new guard emerged as Netflix expanded into businesses including advertising and hired execs with experience from Snap and Hulu to lead the charge. As subscriber growth slowed Netflix also laid off hundreds of staffers in a string of layoffs that impacted its animation studio socialmedia teams contractors and other parts of the company. The streamer also shuffled around some key execs restructuring its studio film team and centralizing TV and film for Europe the Middle East and Africa under content VP Larry Tanz. As the power dynamics shift at Netflix weve updated our organizational chart of the top executives at the streaming company and who they report to. Weve mapped out where its rising stars sit within the power structure including operating and product chief Greg Peters who oversees key bets including advertising and gaming president of worldwide advertising Jeremi Gorman who joined from Snap and has been building out the ad team and Marian Lee who was elevated to chief marketing officer in March. Weve also removed from the chart leaders who exited the company recently including longtime product VP Todd Yellin who left to return to filmmaking senior film exec Tendo Nagenda who departed as part of the film team restructuring and Mark White the former VP of engineering and member of the highlevel Lstaff whose LinkedIn profile now says hes retired ish.

Appearance Like regular employment but perfect. Hammock tester. Sorry Thats my perfect job. Im not sure theres such a thing as a hammock tester. I was talking more in terms of a personalised working schedule and a tailored salary package. Listen as long as I can lie in a hammock all day they can pay me in packing peanuts. Im not sure you understand the concept of the perfect job. I was about to say the same thing about you. Wouldnt you like to choose how much remuneration you take in salary how much in benefits and how much in company equity Is that a trick question No its called customised compensation and its big in the US. Employers including Netflix have been doing it for a long time and now its trickling down to smaller companies. I decide how I get paid Exactly. Some firms even let you convert unused holiday into money towards a retirement plan or student loan repayments. I dont understand why theyre offering me a choice unless theyre trying to rip me off. To stay competitive. Besides different employees have different needs. Which is better cash or equity That depends on the company the economy and you. A year ago youd see employees coming in especially those from the coasts wanting more equity one CEO told the Wall Street Journal. Now they want more financial security and are choosing cash. What else can I get Hybrid working choose when and how often you come into the office. I already have that but I dont choose. It just depends on when the rail strikes are. What about a fourday week In Australia several corporations are making plans to reduce the working week by this year. If it amounts to less work for the same money then yes please. Well Kickstarter which is trialling a fourday week says its employees have been more productive since the pilot began. Sounds awfully like theyre actually doing more work. Another ripoff Even if they are thats not the point the workers are less stressed more energised and more engaged. Why does this sort of thing seem to be happening only outside the UK Perhaps its because were too busy sliding into a giant recession. Oh yeah. Im sorry that none of this applies to you. Do say Fridays off I guess Ill have to start calling in sick on Thursdays. Dont say How would you like to receive your realterms pay cut
"Archaeologist David Wengrow pushes back against Ancient Apocalypse, urges us to consider the power of everyday people","I've previouslyÂ writtenÂ about the Netflix show Ancient Apocalypse, and I'm back for more! This time, it's to share a terrificÂ articleÂ that was published this week in The Nation, entitled ""Apocalypse No! Pseudo-Archaeology, Ancient Tech-Lords, and Ordinary Peoâ€¦",2022-12-29T13:29:44Z,https://boingboing.net/2022/12/29/archaeologist-david-wengrow-pushes-back-against-ancient-apocalypse-urges-us-to-consider-the-power-of-everyday-people.html,Ive previously written about the Netflix show Ancient Apocalypse and Im back for more This time its to share a terrific article published this week in The Nation titled Apocalypse No PseudoArchaeology Ancient TechLords and Ordinary People Why the Netflix series Ancient Apocalypse is worth taking seriously. Hint Its not the science. Its written by David Wengrow a professor of comparative archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology University College London. In the article Wengrow first points out that Graham Hancock star of Netflixs Ancient Apocalypse isnt the first to speculate about how ancient civilizations could have built such amazing structures and societies. Despite Hancocks assertion that hes the victim of big archaeology some of these claims have come from those located within the profession. Wengrow provides us with the example of Egypt and the speculations of late thearly th century British archaeologist William Matthew Flinders Petrie. Wengrow explains Petrie was also a eugenicist who believed in the improvement of society through selective breedingout of intellectually inferior races. While revealing evidence for the foundations of ancient Egypt he attributed it on biometric grounds to a New Race of invaders from outside Africa opening a space of the imagination that has since come to be filled by all manner of theories about the alien architects of ancient civilizations. It started with the race science that is part and parcel of archaeologys own problematic history. Where does it end Skepticism about primitive societies being able to create complex structures and societies then was never limited to outsiders like Hancock. It is in many ways baked into the disciplines of archaeology and anthropology. Wengrow also argues that despite how utterly fanciful and downright bizarre Graham Hancocks vision of the ancient world sometimes is its ultimately a racist vision. And make no mistake Graham paints some unbelievable pictures of ancient worlds. Wengrow writes Speaking recently on The Joe Rogan Experience Hancock speculates at that granite blocks in the tomb of Khufusealed high inside the structure of the Great Pyramid at Gizawere lifted into place by acoustic levitation priests chanting as these huge blocks were lifted into the air by the force of sound alone. Leaving physics aside I tried to picture the kind of society we are being asked to imagine here. I tried to envisage a vanguard of priests assembled on the floodplain of the Nile chanting in unison as the granite blocks rise high above the groundas if by magicfloating into place around the tomb of a divine overlord. I also pictured the awe of the stupid gawking masses as the scene unfolds. How is this racist Wengrow explains It conjures a world in which intelligence is not a property of individuals acting in society but rather a quality possessed to varying degrees by specific peoples. It gives voice to a theory of human difference that today doesnt always dare utter the name racebut retains all the key ingredients of a racial theory. It asks us to imagine past human societies divided into two tiers one superior one inferior one wise one ignorant one comprising noble or sagelike rulers the other servile commoners. In short it is a picture based on a specific form of nostalgia the desire to be dominated by natural masters. In the end this perspective is grounded in the belief that humans including their technologies always progress in linear fashion from primitive simplicity to modern complexity. This way of viewing the world is a hallmark of Enlightenment thinking that as Jamelle Bouie explains created modern race thinking and posited racial hierarchies. Bouie asserts that we are in fact still living in a world shaped by Enlightenment ideas of race and white supremacy. Wengrow explains how this works in the vision of Hancocks Ancient Apocalypse and in theories about social evolution that have had a profound impact on the academic disciplines of archaeology and anthropology Only against that baseline expectation can startling monuments like the earthworks of Poverty Point or the megalithic temples at Gbekli Tepe in southern Turkey appear as anomalies or mysteries in the first place. In that sense Hancocks ideas actually draw sustenance from mainstream theories of social evolution that dominated archaeology and anthropology for much of the th century note his evocation of simple huntergatherers to describe the great mass of early humanity outside the vanguard. Albeit in extremely different ways both approachesthe alternative and the mainstreamhave stubbornly systematically refused to accord past human actors the capacity for social imagination and selfdetermination in the absence of overlords. Wengrow ends his essay with the idea that Graham Hancock and others like himwho forward the idea that the only way sophisticated ancient structures and civilizations could have been created was through wise ancients spreading their superior knowledgefacilitate what Wengrow and his colleague David Graeber call the myth of the stupid savage. Seeing the world through this lens which portrays our remote ancestors as drifting haplessly from dispersed egalitarian forager bands to centralized hierarchical states discounts the actual knowledge of those who came before us. To counter this perspective Wengrew and Graeber in their recent book The Dawn of Everything A New History of Humanity present recent research in archaeology and anthropology demonstrating everyday ordinary premodern groups of people consciously collectively transforming their worldsoften on a prodigious scalewithout being pressganged by a stratum of overlords or forced along by environmental dictates or waves of migration. To hear more The Dawn of Everything A New History of Humanity heres a great video from Democracy Now featuring Amy Goodman interviewing David Wengrow.

In earlier years House of Cards held the distinction of being the series that helped Netflix define its brand for original programming. However when the series closed its final curtain the spotlight fell directly on the absurdly clever series Stranger Things. From its first season Stranger Things became a viral sensation with viewers dressing up like the shows first breakout character Eleven. Now with a few seasons under its belt Stranger Things is arguably more popular than ever. Unfortunately all good things come to an end and the Duffer Brotherscreators of the series announced that the next season would be the shows last. If the thought of losing Stranger Things has you bummed out fret not as according to Comic Book Resources Netflix is planning an anime spinoff for the hit series. The Stranger ThingsCinematic Universe continues to expand with an anime spinoff series reportedly in the works for Netflix. According to Whats on Netflix via Twitter the anime series will be titled Stranger Things Tokyoand is being billed as the first Stranger Thingsspinoff. While plot details are scarce the series will reportedly follow video gameloving twin brothers living on the outskirts of s Tokyo that are sucked into a grand adventure after an encounter with the Upside Down. Tokyois planned to be around six hours long.

Its a complicated undertaking since the show takes inspiration from not only Leigh Bardugos original Shadow and Bone trilogy but also the Six of CrowsCrooked Kingdom duology. The showrunners told Entertainment Weekly that season two covers multiple books and touches on deep cut plotlines that not even Bardugo saw coming. Shadow and Bone wont return to Netflix until early spring so the showrunners kept mum on the details beyond thatthough they were willing to say that the second season will cover the second book in the Shadow trilogy Siege and Storm and will include some events of the third book Ruin and Rising. And while the characters from Six of Crows famously made an appearance in the first season of Shadow and Bone Heisserer and Fryklind say that the plot of the duology will require its own lane so fans can expect a similar mashing of plots in a way that creates a unique and more nuanced look at the Young Adult series. The blending of both the middle YA Shadow and Bone trilogy Six of Crows duology which remains a pair of my favorite fantasy books they are that exceptional was one of the best parts of the show. It elevated the source material and provided an easy impetus for change giving all the characters a richer storyline. Heisserer and Fryklind told the magazine theyre excited to show off the new storyline which will include Nikolia Latntsov Patrick Gibson the grisha twins Tamar KirBataar Anna Leong Brophy and Tolya YulBataar Lewis Tan and Wylan Hendriks Jack Wolfe. There will be nods to the Crows storyline but they are saving the Ice Court job for another season. While its true that this is the main plot of the second Crows book the first books plotline is centered on a plot to create an artificial amplification drug jura parem for the grisha based on a plant that has a fictional positioning not unlike opium. With multiple storylines in the new season there will be more ways in which the threads of the books tie themselves together in the television seriesand from what they could reveal the showrunners sound committed to having fun and creating a cohesive story that embellishes and adds to the plot of the original series of books. Shadow and Bone season two arrives on Netflix on March.

'Glass Onion' director says he didn't want 'A Knives Out Mystery' in the title,"""Glass Onion"" director Rian Johnson said he was ""pissed off"" about the movie's subtitle, and wanted the ""Knives Out"" sequels to be ""self-contained.""",2022-12-27T18:34:58Z,https://www.businessinsider.com/glass-onion-director-didnt-want-knives-out-mystery-movie-title-2022-12,Glass Onion director says he didnt want A Knives Out Mystery in the title Glass Onion director Rian Johnson said he was pissed off about the movies subtitle. He told The Atlantic that he wants the Knives Out sequels to be selfcontained. Knives Out was a surprise hit in grossing million at the worldwide box office after being made for just million. But despite the name recognition director Rian Johnson still wasnt thrilled to have Knives Out in the title of his sequel Glass Onion A Knives Out Mystery which hit Netflix on Friday. Ive tried hard to make them selfcontained Johnson told The Atlantics David Sims in an interview published Monday. Honestly Im pissed off that we have A Knives Out Mystery in the title. You know I want it to just be called Glass Onion. Whether its partly due to the familiar subtitle or not Glass Onion appears to be a hit on Netflix. Its been the No. mostpopular movie on the streamer in the US since it debuted. I get it and I want everyone who liked the first movie to know this is next in the series but also the whole appeal to me is its a new novel off the shelf every time Johnson added. But theres a gravity of a thousand suns toward serialized storytelling. Netflix nabbed the rights to two Knives Out sequels last year meaning viewers can expect a followup to Glass Onion. The deal was worth more than million according to The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline. Johnson his producing partner Ram Bergman and star Daniel Craig were each expected to earn around million as part of the agreement THR reported. Netflix gave Glass Onion a oneweek theatrical release in theaters last month including for the first time in all three major cinema chains AMC Regal and Cinemark. But industry observers feel it could have been a big hit with a more robust theatrical release. Netflix doesnt report boxoffice figures but THR and Variety reported that it earned million to million in its first weekend. Shawn Robbins the Box Office Pro chief analyst told Insider that was an accurate estimate based on his observations of presale tickets and prerelease tracking. I think this should make Netflix rethink how it approaches highprofile movies like this Robbins said. But Netflix has been steadfast in its strategy. During Netflixs most recent earnings call in October coCEO Ted Sarandos said Were in the business of entertaining our members with Netflix movies on Netflix.

Concerns surrounding Kyrgioss physical and psychological fitness for the upcoming Australian Open had been spiralling since the yearold Canberran withdrew from Australias United Cup team at the th hour last month citing an ankle injury. However Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley allayed fears the world No would miss his home Open by confirming he was fit to meet Djokovic in a friendly match at Rod Laver Arena on January with all proceeds donated to charity. Get set for explosive action as tennis most famous frenemies come together on RLA for an exciting practice match tweeted Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley. Friday is the same night Netflix airs the first episode of Break Point a part documentary following tenniss Generation Next. The series focuses on Kyrgios and the games twentysomething stars challenging Djokovic and Nadal at the top a changing of the guard polarising tennis fans but also stressing players. Kyrgios along with his good friend and doubles partner Thanasi Kokkinakis are the focus of Break Points premiere episode which chronicles the pairs incredible run to the Australian Open title in Melbourne in the summer of as well as diving deep into Kyrgioss muchpublicised offcourt issues. Kyrgios reveals in Break Point his life was spiralling out of control that he was drinking every single night and that only the recent intervention of girlfriend Costeen Hatzi saved him from continuing his chaotic opening years on tour. I was OK I cant keep doing this. I just had to be kinder to myself Kyrgios says in an excerpt. I value my family my close close friends and Cossie too much to put tennis in front of that any more I dont think thats healthy. Despite his most successful year on tour in Kyrgios says he doubts hell ever resume a full tennis schedule saying the time away from loved ones wasnt worth it. The first four or five years of my career were just so chaotic Kyrgios reveals. For my mental health I could never be one of those players again that plays all year round. I dont really have any expectations now in my matches I just want to go out there have fun and take the pressure off and we can kind of live more of a normal life its much better like this thats for sure. Kyrgios told the Age this week It was important to me that Netflix saw me for me and not the same narrative general media talks about. I had the team follow me around quite a lot in major points of the year so hopefully this gives people a better insight to me as a person rather than just a tennis player. I know this will ultimately help the sport grow and bring new fans. Kyrgios acknowledges the debt he owes his manager and confidante Daniel Horsfall. He could just see my wellbeing just declining every week. Kyrgios admits. Horsfall reveals he used a tracking device to find his client on long boozy nights out often on the eve of grand slam matches. I used to have your location on my phone Horsfall tells Kyrgios. Some mornings I would physically have to go and find where you were. What hotel you were staying at whose house you were staying at. Before tournaments before a match. Last year Kyrgioss mother Nill told media that former world No Andy Murray was another major catalyst in saving her sons life. The Scot noticed evidence of selfharm on Kyrgioss body and warned his former manager John Morris.
