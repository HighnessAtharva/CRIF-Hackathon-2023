Kabosu an adorable 17yearold shiba inu from Japan fell sick on Christmas Eve. Her owner Atsuko Sato posted on Instagram describing her condition as very dangerous and saying the dog had stopped drinking and eating the post drew thousands of wishes. She also revealed that the the dog has chronic lymphoma leukaemia a type of cancer and acute cholangiohepatitis an inflammatory condition of the liver and bile ducts. But Ms Satos latest post on Friday says Kabosu is able to finish her meals drink plenty of water and even go for a short walk in the park. Im amazed how quickly she bounced back Ms Sato said addressing her 422000 followers and thanking them for their support. The Miracle of Kabosu couldnt have happened without your warm wishes and prayers she wrote. Kabosus fans and the cryptocurrency community certainly rallied behind her in the last few days on TikTok Twitter and Instagram. Your prayers are working DogeDesigner cbdoge December 29 2022 Our Doge Kabosu is recovering well. She had her meal and even went for a walk today.

The craze soon sparked a flurry of doge memes a longago accidental misspelling of dog amused the internet and quickly became popular. Later that year two programmers launched a cryptocurrency Dogecoin with Kabosu as its face. It was meant to be a joke but last year Dogecoins value shot up by some 4000 after Elon Musk dubbed it the peoples crypto. ur welcome pic. twitter. come2KF57KLxb Elon Musk elonmusk February 4 2021 It has since fallen as cryptocurrencies everywhere crashed.

The Out-of-Touch Adults' Guide to Kid Culture: Do You Really Need ID to Watch Porn in Louisiana?,"While the House of Representatives is stuck in a hellish series of endless votes that resolve nothing, their grandchildren are welcoming the new year by memeing a weird dog breed, offloading worthless NFTs, and lying to their parents about dead celebrities.

But at least they dont have drivers licenses so we know they are safe from watching online porn... in Louisiana anyway. Meet the newest meme dog the borzoi Move aside Pomeranians Shiba Inus and Corgis Theres a new dog sheriff in Memesville. Borzois are taking over the internet. Also known as Russian wolfhounds these pups were originally bred as sighthounds for hunting. Theyre athletic loyal and eventempered but thats not why TikTok likes them so much. The key to the breeds adorability is their comically elongated faces topped with big expressive eyes that make them resemble all kind of different objects in a uniquely poignant way. They look like soap dispensers pencils doorstops anteaters floppy socks and slices of pizza. They look hilarious with eyebrows. But mostly they look kind of vulnerable and sad. Borzois are the ultimate meme dogs until the next breed comes along. Why are kids telling their parents their favorite celebrities died If your kid or some other young person in your life tells you that your favorite famous person has died dont fall for it. Telling your parents their favorite celebrity has keeled over and filming the reaction is a trend thats been catching on over the last week or so on the TikTok machine. For the record Elton John Barack Obama Jennifer Anniston and Donald Trump are very much alive in spite of the videos showing adults anguished reactions to their deaths. I like a morbid joke as much as anyone and it can be funny to see how upset people get over the supposed deaths of people theyll never meet but on the other hand these videos are essentially mocking people for having emotions and thats not cool. Its especially not cool when you tell your parents that a friend of theirs who happens to be famous died as happened to actress Angela Bassett recently. Company buying worthless NFTs In what is perhaps a fitting coda to the entire NFT saga a couple of entrepreneurs have started a company that buys worthless NFTs so that people who invested in digital goods can at least unload them and writeoff the losses on their taxes. The firm is called Unsellable and it will buy any NFT purchased on the Ethereum blockchain regardless of the quality or rarity for the equivalent of one cent then send you a receipt so you can prove to the IRS that you actually did invest a lot of money in digital magic beans. They will not however sell you your NFT back for two cents. So far they say theyve purchased 5000 NFTs and are a little vague as to what theyre going to actually do with them. Since this takes place in the world of NFTs theres a chance it could be some kind of scam or boondoggle. Shocking I know. Louisianas new porn law raises serious questions A new state law went into effect on Jan. 1 in Louisiana that requires websites that host pornographic material to verify the ages of the people accessing their sites. Instead of clicking yes to the question Are you over 18 Louisiana pornenjoyers who try to access sites like Pornhub will have to provide ID that proves they are adults who want to masturbate. In practice that means setting up an account with the service AllPassTrust and sending em a copy of your drivers license. While Louisiana promises it wont collect or store user addresses and phone numbers its making some people nervous. Who wants their name on that list right Theres also the issue of the laws vagueness. It states that sites that contain more than 33. 3 pornography are required to verify ages but defining pornography beyond I know it when I see it seems impossible not to mention determining what sites are more than onethird porn. Theres a lot of porn on Reddit but is it a 33 How about Twitter If a site puts up two mundane photos for each naked one is it required to verify IDs I know The South does things a little differently but Id be surprised if this law isnt challenged in court quickly. Theres money to be made after all. Also whats to stop young people from using the most reliable porn site around Google Images Viral video of the week playing every single frogger game just to feel something YouTuber Noodle maintains an engaging channel where he talks about video games through homemade paper cutout puppets. This week he dives deep into the history of Frogger by playing every iteration of the series in the aptly titled video playing every single frogger game just to feel something. I didnt even know there were any Frogger games beyond Frogger but it turns there have been a ton of weird and mostly terrible attempts to bring the franchise to more modern game systems including a Legend of Zelda style outing called Froggers Journey The Forgotten Relic and a truly horrific 3D platform called Frogger The Great Quest. I know video game characters are just collections of pixels without human emotions but theres something sad to me about most modernizations of older game stars. I picture PacMan as a Norma Desmond type alone in his 80s mansion drunkenly reminiscing about when he was the biggest star in the world wondering how Mario has managed to stay relevant for so long and drunk dialing Ms. PacMan and hanging up.

In a recent study scientists have found evidence that some microscopic organisms actively feed on viruses. Though this may be the first virovore ever documented many others likely exist the team says. In the simplest of terms viruses are incredibly tiny packages of genetic material. Though they carry out many biological functions such as replicating themselves they need to infect and take over the machinery of cells belonging to other organisms in order to do soa parasitic state of being that has led to fierce and ongoing debate over whether viruses should be considered living things. Regardless of their exact definition viruses play many vital roles in the life cycle of every other creature in the world humans included. Researchers at the University of NebraskaLincoln seem to be the first to investigate whether viruses might be on the menu. Their earlier work made them familiar with chloroviruses viruses abundant in freshwater that infect green algae. They wondered if certain waterdwelling organisms ever relied on viruses as a source of energy. To test their hypothesis they first collected samples of pond water. Then they moved as many distinct types of microscopic beings into the water as possible. Lastly they introduced large amounts of chlorovirus into the water and simply waited for a day to see if anything would change. By the end of their experiments they identified a species of Halteriaa singlecelled protozoanthat appeared to eat the chloroviruses. Not only did populations of the virus dwindle in the presence of the Halteria but the number of protozoans grew at the same time indicating that the microbes were using the virus as fuel. The Halteria also didnt grow when the chloroviruses werent around. And when the team used fluorescent green dye to mark the DNA of chloroviruses before they entered the water they could clearly see the stomachs of the Halteria light up afterward seemingly confirming their viral diet. It may not be too surprising that some smaller creatures would evolve to intentionally ingest viruses. But as far as the researchers could tell their study is the first to show that some microbes can sustain themselves with viruses alone. Their findings published late last month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences also suggest that Halteria can feed off chloroviruses just as effectively as other microscopic organisms can feed off tiny sources of food like bacteria and algae. They estimate that Halteria in a small pond may be able to eat as many as 10 trillion chloroviruses a day. Viruses are made up of really good stuff nucleic acids a lot of nitrogen and phosphorous lead author John DeLong an associate professor of biological sciences said in a statement released by the university. So many things will eat anything they can get ahold of. Surely something would have learned how to eat these really good raw materials. Far from being a simple curiosity the teams research could have some important implications. These viruses are already known to play an integral part in their freshwater environments since they recycle carbon and other nutrients which effectively prevents the energy provided from these nutrients from reaching other larger forms of life. But if living things are eating these viruses which are then eaten by bigger organisms and so on then some of the nutrients and energy they would normally recycle might instead work their way up the food chain. If this is happening at the scale that we think it could be it should completely change our view on global carbon cycling DeLong said. DeLong and his team say theyve since identified other microorganisms that appear capable of virovory in the lab. But while they suspect that many creatures can feed off viruses they plan to find out whether this regularly happens in the wild. And from there it will take more work to know how virovores affect their surrounding environments.
Dog starts house fire after turning on hairdryer,"Crews were called to Hockley, Essex, on Christmas Eve and treated the dog and owner at the scene.",2022-12-24T22:49:40Z,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-64088063,Dog starts house fire after turning on hairdryer Published A dog is believed to have caused a fire in a house on Christmas Eve after accidentally turning a hairdryer on. Essex Fire Service said crews were called to Hockley Essex following reports of a smokefilled house. Firefighters worked quickly to extinguish the fire after locating it in the bedroom. The dog was waiting by the front door when the homeowner returned and both were treated for smoke inhalation the service said. Watch manager Gary Shinn said The homeowner was out and came back to find her house full of smoke. We believe the fire started because a hairdryer was left plugged in and on a bed. We think the dog may have then jumped on the bed and turned the hairdryer on eventually causing it to catch alight to the bedding and mattress. Once youve finished with any electrical appliances such as hairdryers and straighteners please take a moment to unplug them.
How did our dog manage to work his way across all the boundaries I set in the house? | Ranjana Srivastava,"I strived to restrict our dog to ‘dog areas’, namely downstairs, off the good carpet and definitely not on the bed“I am so sorry!”A big dog has suddenly cornered mine in the dog park.

I am furious but hold my tongue conceding that its elderly owner could not have intervened any faster. Relief courses through my veins as I snatch my dog away. My children would have killed me if anything ever happened to him. Were you on your phone Why werent you paying attention How could you let this happen Questions from my own repertoire would have come back to bite me. Of course they would beget their own loaded questions in return who promised to do everything for the dog and who does everything Why was the dog on a walk between meetings and not after school But as I often point out to no one who is listening the dog is ours and we owe him our care. In his first year Odie survived Covid but nearly died after eating a grape. Well at least the vet though he might so caught between two ridiculous costs the price of a pandemic puppy versus the vets fees I chose the lesser evil. Suffice to say the 800 grape soured me for ever. We dont buy grapes now we simply devour other peoples. This year I am pleased to report that Odie has been safe and has found his place in the family. Once I asked my marriedwithchildren friend how her dog was doing. He is the love of my life she swooned. Now I get it. The other day my teenager said If you line up our whole family and Odie Id pick Odie every single time. He brings me joy. Remind me not to compete with a dog for affection. When someone comes home the first person to be greeted is the dog. There is a dash to rescue him from his cushioned bonereplete kennel outside nestled in a corner and shielded from the elements. Sometimes our outings are constrained by his needs. Too dark too rainy or too cold and the kids resist putting him outdoors. I havent told them that my friend John used to leave the television on Oprah all day for his dog. I used to mock John for this idiosyncrasy but when I see how Odie consumes David Attenborough and growls animatedly at the lions I feel as if he was on to something. He follows me around dutifully and lets me prop my feet against his soft fur The dog repays our love by being the only one to faithfully meet and greet us when we come home. Instead of mumbling something unintelligible without looking up from the TV remote Odie skids and skates to the door paying no heed to the risk of a fractured leg. His tail wags overtime as he makes cute guttural sounds and promptly rolls over for a belly scratch while holding out hope for a snack. It is impossible to resist anyone who takes such unalloyed pleasure at your presence and whose behaviour is not dictated by what happened at the office that day. I cant say I wasnt warned about this predictable fate of dogowners but for the first year I strived to restrict the dog to dog areas namely downstairs off the good carpet and absolutely off the good sofa. After all he had a plush bed bought at full price on the kind of impulse I rarely reserve for myself. The dog needs boundaries I warned as Odie clambered on to laps and snuggled at various feet ensconced in the folds of a blanket. Then like a stealthy invader he crept up the stairs. And then one day behold he was on the big bed where we congregate for family time. I screeched and Odie jumped off. He tried again and I growled. But Odie can read vibes. He knew that the consensus view maintained that shoving an innocent dog off the communal bed was not the done thing. Odie won. Now he invites himself and his antler wedges it between our toes and gnaws diligently while we watch The Crown. He periodically growls at the Queens corgis and horses proud to defend us from those dangers lurking behind the screen. I explain my concession by espousing that Odie was not born to be a common ground dog. At the time of writing he is only allowed on the foot side of the bed and is under no circumstances to occupy a pillow even the one that says Dogs first they steal your bed then they steal your heart. My relationship with Odie has evolved from carer to companion. He follows me around dutifully and lets me prop my feet against his soft fur. When I write in bed he jumps up making sure that some part of him touches me. Then as soon as I posit a walk his ears perk up before one paw and then another slams my keyboard deleting entire paragraphs or interspersing carefully curated words with random letters. But he is so thrilled at the prospect of going to the same place at the same time with the same person that I too feign excitement and take him to the reserve where he madly chases after birds with the wind in his hair while onlookers stop to watch in delight. My favourite is a young man with a disability. An older man at his nursing home drives him to the oval every day to walk laps together. As if this kindness isnt enough the older man also helps him buy tiny treats which he gives the dogs with permission. The dogs love him and he adores them. This ritual might just be the happiest part of his day at once humanising and a reminder of the transforming power of small gestures performed by quiet people. I recently spied a party in a posh park where the dogs wore Dior collars and each dog guest received a pricey gift bag. My guilt at Odies worn brown leash and councilissued poop bags lasted but an instant. I dont know whether dogs have birthday expectations but as he turns two my wish for him is simply that he lives a long and happy life. I had not anticipated what a fountain of joy and gratification he would turn out to be.
Review: 'Velma' tries to milk grown-up laughs out of 'Scooby-Doo's' pre-dog days,"""This is my story, told my way,"" the title character narrates at the outset of ""Velma,"" an adult-oriented take on ""Scooby-Doo"" that demonstrates the limits of stretching what amounts to a one-note joke into a series.

Sporadically witty but ultimately rather tedious the HBO Max comedy leverages more than a halfcentury of name equity to yield an animated prequel thats definitely not for kids meddling or otherwise. Playing revisionist games with ScoobyDoo has become a fashionable pastime including a recent movie that established Velmas LGBTQ credentials which not surprisingly garnered a fair amount of media attention. Velma fleshes out that idea with a protracted murder mystery courtesy of producers Mindy Kaling who provides the voice of Velma and her The Mindy Project collaborator Charlie Grandy bringing new wrinkles to the gang and their mostly bizarre parents during the predog days of their highschool years. Aside from becoming a more diverse bunch the Scoobyfree gang includes the airheaded and lascivious Fred Glenn Howerton Daphne Constance Wu who was Velmas pal until she reached her teens and became hot and Norville Sam Richardson who hasnt gone Shaggy yet but who is a walking emotional doormat with an unreciprocated crush on Velma. When classmates start dying specifically Ruhroh having their brains extracted Velma leaps into investigator mode although having a serial killer in town takes a back seat to the indignities of the highschool years and raging hormones. As far as that goes Velma is essentially pansexual and attracted to pretty much everyone while dealing with a home environment that includes a missing mom and dismissive father who treats her terribly prompting her to say things like Hey dad can we talk You can be drunk if thats easier. Grandy and Kaling dont limit their satire to the series as they bring the 1960s creation into the 21stcentury allowing them to lampoon current trends and popculture oddities like the way parents are depicted in teen dramas. Those observations yield their share of amusing lines like Velma angrily snapping at Daphne Id punch you if men didnt sexualize women fighting. Still 10 episodes of this eight episodes were previewed feels like too much of an atbestOK thing in a show that works overtime at replicating an irreverent Adult Swimstyle sensibility. Theres nothing wrong with handing the keys to a venerable property to writers with the hope of breathing some life into it especially with a concept as lightweight as the original series. Sorry but goofing around with a 54yearold HannaBarbera cartoon shouldnt ruin anyones childhood. That said Velma feels a little too pleased with itself to truly capitalize on the opportunity a fun idea that sounds like a great way to reintroduce those meddling kids but that finally isnt clever enough to get away with it. Velma premieres January 12 on HBO Max which like CNN is a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery.

But the Salary Could Repel Even the Most Hot Dog Obsessed Applicants The hot dog brand is looking for 12 people to travel around the country in a 27footlong hot dog on wheels. The perfect job for hot dog lovers is looking to hire but takers may have to cut back on the fixings. Oscar Mayer is scouting for 12 new Hotdoggers to drive the iconic Wienermobile around the country as part of the brands annual and mostknown marketing strategy. The hotdog company first introduced the Wienermobile a car in the shape of a giant frankfurter in 1936 on the streets of Chicago to help boost sales. In 1988 the brand enacted its Hotdogger program which recruits recent graduates to drive the Wienermobile and promote the brand across the country for a year. Theyve hired a new class of Hotdoggers every year since. Today the brand has six Wienermobiles each spanning 27 feet long. According to Fox Business Hotdoggers must commit to a oneyear contract and travel across 20000 miles to more than 20 states. They will also be responsible for creating social content and collectively handing out more than 250000 Wiener Whistles. While a job description for the role says it covers expenses and offers a competitive salary according to Glassdoor Hotdoggers only make about 36000 a year. Entrepreneur has reached out to Oscar Mayer for more information on salary. Still the company said the job gets plenty of applicants. Less than 1 of applicants are typically selected for the 12 positions making it statistically easier to get accepted into an Ivy League university than be granted acceptance into Oscar Mayers coveted Hotdogger class the company said in a statement to Fox Business.

Support staff on jetskis managed to get the 47yearold to the beach but all attempts to revive him failed. Freire was one of the three Brazilian surfers who became known as the Mad Dogs after conquering the giant wave Jaws in Hawaii. They featured in the 2016 documentary Mad Dogs. Tributes from other surfers poured in on Instagram. He surfed all day with a big smile on his face. Thats how Ill keep him in my memory. Legend posted fellow big wave surfer Nic von Rupp. Today we lost a great man a very good friend and a legendary surfer Marcio Freire. He was such a happy spirit always with a smile on his face... Rest in peace my friend wrote sports photographer Fred Pompermayer. Nazare boasts some of the biggest waves in the world. They are magnified by an underwater canyon 5km three miles deep which ends where the North Atlantic meets the shoreline near the former fishing village. American Garrett McNamara put Nazare on the map in 2011 when he set a world record for the biggest wave ever surfed at 78 feet 23. 77 metres. Brazilian Rodrigo Koxa bettered McNamaras mark in 2017 also at Nazare and German Sebastian Steudtner broke the record again there in 2020 surfing an 86feet 26. 21metre wave.

Should my girlfriend’s dog stop sleeping in our bed?,"She lets the dog spend the night with them; he thinks it’s gross. You make the call on where sleeping dogs should lieLuna is always on our mattress at night, and I think it’s gross. She’s got a dog bed downstairs Continue reading...",2022-12-25T00:00:10Z,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/25/should-my-girlfriends-dog-stop-sleeping-in-our-bed,The prosecution Ronnie Luna is always on our mattress at night and I think its gross. Shes got a dog bed downstairs Ive just bought a house and my girlfriend Tilda stays over most nights with her little dog Luna. I like Luna a lot. Shes a Jack Russell terrier and very friendly. She is allowed anywhere in the house except if I had it my way the bed. Tilda disagrees. I havent had a chance to buy a bed frame since moving in and Luna regularly gets on our mattress at night. We keep a little cushion dog bed in the corner of the bedroom and a crate for her downstairs but Tilda is reluctant to leave her down there. Tilda says Lunas no hassle you wont even notice shes there. But during the night the dog will come and sit on your chest and lick your face before falling asleep on you which is too much. Of course you notice when a dog is breathing in your face. I find it harder to sleep because Im conscious of her there. Theres also the hygiene issue even though Luna is shorthaired and doesnt shed much shes still a dog. Its gross to think of the germs on her claws rubbing off on us and our sheets. When Tilda and I first got together two years ago I was living with my parents and Tilda with her mum. When Tilda came to spend time with me she didnt bring Luna over as much as my parents had their house rules. We couldnt have the dog upstairs so Luna stayed in her crate. But now Ive bought a house and Tilda and Luna are staying over all the rules seem to have gone out the window. Now Lunas gotten into the habit of sleeping with us its hard to get her out of it. I have tried putting my foot down recently putting her in the crate before bed myself but she just whines until Tilda asks if we can go to get her and ends up in our bed. Its a vicious cycle and has affected my sleep. Tilda needs to be stricter with Luna. Its her dog so she needs to put a plan in place so we can all get a good nights sleep. Tilda is hoping to move in fulltime soon but unless we get this issue sorted I cant see it working out with the three of us under one roof. A dogs place is in its own bed not in the bed of its owner. The defence Tilda If Ronnie doesnt like Luna on the bed he should buy a bed frame to stop her jumping up I got Luna in lockdown when I was single and living alone in France. She was my companion my rock during hard times. I moved back to the UK and met Ronnie two years ago. Luna has always slept in my bed or in my room so its hard to train her out of it. Ronnie does love Luna. Shes a gorgeous little pooch sociable kind and loving and she even responds to his commands. Its just the sleeping that is the issue. I actually like having her snuggled up beside us in bed but Ronnie thinks its gross. However I always make sure Luna is super clean and bathe her regularly. She certainly doesnt have fleas so Im not sure why hes concerned about that. Luna also doesnt really shed her hair and I brush her teeth. Id love to have her inside the duvet with us more often but Ronnie doesnt really allow it. Occasionally she will stay in her bed in the corner of our bedroom but I dont really like putting her in the crate downstairs as she whines. Ronnie says if I stick to it she will get used to it but her whimpering pulls at my heartstrings so I usually cave in and let her back up into our room after about an hour. Once shes in our room shes as good as gold. The main reason Luna hops up on the bed is because we are really still sleeping on a mattress the floor. Ronnie has yet to get a bed frame he says he hasnt gotten around to it but its already been five months. It might remove temptation if Ronnie invested in a bed frame that makes it more difficult for Luna to jump up on to. Failing that I could start training her to sleep away from us more but I just find it sad as I love having her in the bed with us. I was happy to obey Ronnies parents rules before but now I am spending more time at his house I think he could relax a bit. Luna and I will soon be living there too so he might have to get used to having her on our furniture. The jury of Guardian readers Should Tildas dog stop sleeping on the bed I too put off buying a bed frame in my early 20s but since Ronnies already at the movinginandgettingadog stage of life he needs to get one ASAP. Then hell have the moral authority to keep Luna off the bed however adorable she is. Until then enjoy those face licks. Joel 43 Im sure Luna is a cute pooch but its not hygienic to have an animal in your bed. The bed frame is a red herring Tilda needs to respect Ronnies wishes and train Luna to sleep elsewhere. Veronica 42 Its unreasonable for Tilda to expect Ronnie to accept having Luna in their bed. However its almost impossible to train Luna while the mattress is on the floor. Ronnie needs to buy a bed frame then Tilda needs to train Luna to sleep in the dog bed. Sarah 59 Tilda is guilty. Personally Im a fan of sleeping with a pup but in a relationship that decision has to be unanimous. Tilda has to push through and train Luna. I understand the heartbreak when the dog cries at night but sleep is important and you shouldnt mess with someone elses. Verity 23 Tilda doesnt seem to have any regard for Ronnies feelings. Attempting to blame him by saying he should buy a bed frame is plain silly. And you can clean Lunas teeth all you like but shes still going to lick her own bum Jane 51 You be the judge So now you can be the judge. In our online poll below tell us Should Tildas dog stop sleeping on the bed Well share the results on next weeks You be the judge. The poll is now closed Last weeks result We asked if Donald should listen to his girlfriend Daisy and close the kitchen cupboards after himself. 3 of you said no Donald is innocent97 of you said yes Donald is guilty
Meet Dog-E: Your Kid's New Robot Best Friend - CNET,"This robo-pooch is cute, playful and rechargeable.",2023-01-05T23:02:17Z,https://www.cnet.com/tech/meet-dog-e-your-kids-new-robot-best-friend/,Pet lovers see their dogs as special oneinamillion creatures. Soon youll be able to get a robot thats one in a million too. DogE from tech toymaker WowWee 80 launched at CES is an appconnected robot dog thats unique to each of its owners thanks to its more than 1 million possible combinations of lights sounds and personality traits. Read more Check out our mustsee reveals of CES most futuristic tech and wildest future tech and gizmos Out of the box the robot dog features different colors of collars and tails. Then when turned on for the first time DogEs allwhile body will light up in a surprise color though kids can change it later through the connected app if they dont like what they get. The puppy then comes to life in a minting process as kids pet and play with it gradually revealing its specific personality. Some dogs will always be hungry while others might be more playful or shy WowWee says. You can train the dog to do tricks give kisses and talk by displaying text and emojis when it wags its tail. I had some fun playing with one of the prototypes on display at a press event this week. When I scratched the top of DogEs head it nuzzled my hand. The robot dog was small and light with a soft feel to it. It didnt have the heavy clunky feel of similar toys Ive tried out in the past. Im curious what my kids would think of DogE. Theyve been begging for a dog for years but living in a small New York City apartment has kept that from happening. Would they settle for a DogE Probably not but I can still imagine my 8yearold playing with this at least for a while. DogE is available for preorder now through the companys website. It will be available online and at retailers in time for the 2023 holiday season the website currently suggests a shipping month of September 2023.

How the CEO of Zoom Room is Leading the Way in Dog Training and Education,Zoom Room is a platform that celebrates teaching as a profession and elevates dog training to a serious career.,2023-01-11T13:00:00Z,https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/this-ceo-is-elevating-dog-training-to-a-serious-career/441231,How the CEO of Zoom Room is Leading the Way in Dog Training and Education Zoom Room is a platform that celebrates teaching as a profession and elevates dog training to a serious career. Mark Van Wye loves to teach. Specifically he loves to teach about teaching. He once ran a summer program for teens called School School that laid bare the motivations of teachers administrators and testmakers to facilitate higher performance. Van Wyes first job was teaching computer programming at a night school for adults. He was 11 years old and the following year he would start his first entrepreneurial adventure a twosided marketplace for schools to increase efficiency while reducing friction between students and teachers. For this endeavor he was presented with an award from the Governor of Florida that is usually reserved for superintendents and principals. In high school Van Wye split his time between working in biomedical research laboratories and ghostwriting educational newsletters on personal finance for ShearsonLehman. He then went on to receive a Ford Foundation grant to conduct educational research with Easter Seals employing emerging technology. This was all while he was a neuroscience major at Amherst College. Related Learn About Your Dogs DNA and Get Hours of Obedience Training OnDemand After college Van Wye worked in educational television taught in classrooms and developed educational curricula for clients such as Microsoft Disney and Nintendo. Today Van Wye has found enormous success in his company Zoom Room. I know it sounds a bit meta but we as franchisors teach franchisees how to teach their trainers how to teach our clients how to train their dogs says Van Wye. How exactly did dogs enter the picture The pivot from teaching kids to dogs was surprisingly easy Van Wye said. On the business side there was an addressable market in the billions an opportunity to own an entire category worldwide one that had seen almost no innovation. But on the personal side I think it was something else. Its not unusual for CEOs to talk about passion for what they do. Related When This Dog Training Company Went OffCourse the Owner Took a TimeOut. Heres How He Got It Back on All Fours. The most formative work I did for Zoom Room was developing curricula for millions of kids through the Boys Girls Clubs of America. I learned how to pilot and evaluate. I learned how to turn volunteers into skilled tutors. I learned that the most meaningful outcomes came from anything that led caregivers to spend more time with their kids. And I learned that those kids in disenfranchised communities who had a family dog regularly outperformed their peers. Van Wye himself grew up with Snowy a standard poodle. The reality is that not every kid has loving parents but having a dog provides people of any age most profoundly children with the perfect crucible for experiencing true unconditional love says Van Wye. Its little wonder that the staff uniform at Zoom Room doesnt even include the name of his company. It reads Love. Unconditionally. Zoom Room is unique. You cant drop your dog off. You attend classes with your dog but you yourself are the student. One time I was at these MTV Movie Awards and my Komondor Clyde and I were called up on the stage and asked to describe Zoom Room. I sort of faltered a bit and said I was there from Zoom Room Dog Training but We dont train dogs. We train the people who love them. And thus the Zoom Rooms official motto was born. One of Van Wyes parallel goals for Zoom Room is to create a platform that celebrates teaching as a profession while also elevating dog training as worthy of a serious career path. Van Wye has leveraged decades of knowledge about education into Zoom Rooms success. For example work with differentiated learning became the franchises celebrated and lucrative Levels system affording clients flexible scheduling and the ability to proceed at ones own pace. For me Zoom Room has been a dream come true because its centered on my lifelong commitment to and belief in positive reinforcement. Ive even raised my son with this philosophy. Van Wye says. Theres no denying the successful outcomes for Van Wye and Zoom Room. The company entered 2020 with nine locations and today it has 90 franchise agreements across 26 states. Van Wye even authored the bestselling dog training book Puppy Training in Seven Easy Steps as well as a puppy training book just for kids. Zoom Room boasts more fivestar reviews than any other dog trainer in the country resulting in an NPS score of 90 for the business. I wont rest until Zoom Room is truly synonymous with dog training not just here in the U. S. but worldwide says Van Wye. Based upon the financial success of the model and its meteoric trajectory Zoom Room is the culmination of Van Wyes lifelong love of learning and teaching.

However Limenitis Reducta has brought a robot dog into the world and plans to equip it for some FPV adventures. The robot dog itself goes by the name of LOTP for unspecified reasons and was designed from the ground up in Fusion 360. A Teensy 3. 5 is charged with running the show managing control inputs and outputting the requisite instructions to the motor controllers to manage the walk cycle. Movement are issued via a custom RC controller. Thanks to an onboard IMU the robotic platform is able to walk effectively and maintain its balance even on a sloping or moving platform. Limenitis has built the robot with a modular platform to support different duties. Equitable modules include a sensor for detecting dangerous gases a drone launching platform and a lidar module. Theres also a provision for a camera which sends live video to the remote controller. Limenitis has that implemented with what appears to be a regular drone FPV camera a straightforward way to get the job done. Its a fun build that looks ready to scamper around on adventures outside. Doing so with an FPV camera certainly looks fun and weve seen similar gear equipped on other robot dogs too.

The VC dream machine pumped out one dumb startup after another. 2023 should put an end to that.,"After pumping NFTs, dog-walking startups, and groceries to your door in 10 minutes, startup investors should show more discipline in 2023.",2022-12-21T14:06:32Z,https://www.businessinsider.com/2023-should-see-fewer-vc-funded-dumb-ideas-2022-12,The VC dream machine pumped out one dumb startup after another. 2023 should put an end to that. 2023 should curtail the current flow of bad startup ideas. Easy money and tech solutionism saw investors juicing everything from NFTs to dogwalking startups. Lately few ideas have proven to be too dumb for venture capital money. VCs are in the business of betting on speculative ideas. The way it roughly works is to bet millions across lots of startups in the hope one of them blows up and returns that cash. But a blitz in capital and a perhaps misguided faith in technology have seen VCs juice up everything from robot pizza makers to NFTs to dogwalking apps over the past few years. VC silliness peaked this year in the public consciousness. Elizabeth Holmes the fraudulent founder of venturebacked Theranos was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison. Her downfall was portrayed in ABC News series The Dropout. VCfueled founder hubris also hit the entertainment mainstream through WeCrashed the dramatization of the WeWork saga and SuperPumped which centers on Ubers enfant terrible Travis Kalanick. None of this is a good look for an industry that prides itself on funding innovation. Still a combination of reputational damage and a tightening monetary environment should mean VCs pull back from startups that clearly have no chance in hell. Why bad businesses got so much money Some gory details around recent startup collapses might make even the most financially unsavvy spectator ask how on earth so many investment professionals were happy to overlook obvious problems. Take FTX the crypto exchange led by disgraced founder Sam BankmanFried that collapsed with an 8 billion hole. BankmanFried was arrested in the Bahamas and awaits possible extradition to the US. At its peak the exchange won investment from bluechip names such as SoftBank Lightspeed and Sequoia the latter once crowing about being won over by BankmanFried as he played League of Legends during a pitch meeting. Also in the recycling bin is Pollen a British events startup founded by two brothers who Insider reported Tuesday were accused by staffers of running amok lavish spending after raising cash and sexual harassment. Representatives for the firm denied the allegations to Insider. The company imploded in August and investors such as Backed Molten Ventures Northzone and Kindred Capital have apparently quietly melted into the background. Finally the firesale of German rapiddelivery startup Gorillas to its rival Getir at about a third of its peak valuation marks the deflating online grocery delivery bubble in Europe. Gorillas was once valued at around 3 billion but was snapped up by Getir for just 1. 2 billion earlier this month. One investors take FOMO. FTX is an example where it was all compounded super hot space crypto where fundamentals dont even really exist plus huge growth and handwavey metrics said Rob Kniaz Londonbased partner at earlystage investor Hoxton Ventures which didnt back FTX. Doubt that happens again for a while. Kniaz contends the FOMO drove less due diligence than usual lately. A period of low interest rates saw cash flowing to investors who then made increasingly outlandish bets to try and return that capital. VCs were able to raise bigger and bigger funds as institutional backers such as pension funds and endowments gave them more cash. Tourist investors such as hedge fund firm Tiger Global also began indexing startups essentially competing with VCs. Most folks had no choice but to try and run to hot startups said Kniaz and they simply didnt have enough time to do the proper due diligence on founders and business models. The subsequent markup in valuations means a correction is due. Fewer insane ideas We are no longer in a lowinterestrate market meaning startup investors who could once rely on generous backers will have to be more cautious about how they spend their money. They do have lots of money with an estimated 290 billion of capital available to them in October according to Pitchbook data. That money will need to go somewhere but investors will be picking founders more cautiously prioritizing profitability over growth for now. In practice expect more boring software deals and fewer dogwalking apps. As the tide recedes Kniaz is optimistic that there will be a natural reversion to the mean where people can be more thoughtful in analysis. There are signs that this is already in motion. European startups are on course to raise 85 billion this year 17 short of last years dealmaking across the continent according to analysis by VC firm Atomico. I think when belts tighten you see fewer insane ideas and especially fewer models where the underlying economics dont add up Kniaz said. Some dumb ideas will doubtless persist Venture capitalists dont need to make their fund performances public and some will want to maintain wild valuations for startups already on their books. But Kniaz senses a shift in motion This next year will show which emperor has clothes on or not. Lots of companies will get marked down so fund performance will be adjusted quite a bit.

How to sleep well at any age – from babies (and their parents) to dog-tired midlifers,"A good night’s sleep is vital for our health, but our needs change throughout our lives. Experts reveal how to maximise the benefits for everyoneThe fundamental purpose of sleep is to “service” our brains so they’re in good working order for the gargantuan ta…",2022-12-31T13:00:18Z,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/31/how-to-sleep-well-health-experts-age-babies-parents,Babies The fundamental purpose of sleep is to service our brains so theyre in good working order for the gargantuan tasks we require of them so it makes perfect sense that babies whose brains are doing the most demanding work a human brain will ever do need a lot of sleep. Newborns tend to spend more time asleep than awake as much as 18 hours in 24 but all babies are different and their needs change all the time so dont worry too much about their sleeping patterns. The rule of thumb is so long as theyre alert and happy when theyre awake then theyre getting enough sleep says Professor Helen Ball director of the Durham Infancy Sleep Centre. With babies sleep issues are never just about them theyre as much or even more about the parents sleep. Indeed the impact on sleep is the biggest worry most people have around the birth of a child. New parents fear being kept awake but its also important to realise that our sleeping habits change when theres a new arrival. Dr Lindsay Browning the founder of the sleep advice website Trouble Sleeping explains more When were new parents were much more easily woken up because we want to wake up for the baby. So we find our sleep is lighter and then you get broken sleep when the baby has woken up. You can have this pressure on yourself to go back to sleep before the baby wakes up again in another two hours and that stress can lead to people really struggling with sleep. Napping can be helpful says Dr Nerina Ramlakhan a physiologist and sleep expert whose latest book is Finding Inner Safety The Key to Healing Thriving and Overcoming Burnout. However she stresses its about napping the right way. Power naps are between five and 20 minutes. Or if youre starting to get really rundown having a replacement nap is usually longer than that up to 40 minutes. This should happen at some point between 2pm and 4pm but no later. Babies arent born knowing the difference between night and day so some of the work of parenting a child in the first weeks and months is getting them used to this. Thats why its important to make sure your baby is exposed to daylight and stimulation during the day and to ensure they have a dim and quiet environment at night while moving towards regular bedtimes and wakeup times to regulate their system. Circadian development is not instantaneous says Ball. It happens over the course of about six months. For many parents getting a crying child to sleep is the hard bit. New research has found that holding and walking with them for five minutes will reduce the childs heart rate and promote sleep. If you hold the baby for eight minutes after theyve gone to sleep and then carefully lay them down in the cot this should mean they sleep for longer. But whatever the research says the important thing is to figure out what works for you and your baby. And at some point youll need to make the switch so theyre being put down to sleep while theyre still awake. If the association is always of a parent having to be there a child wont learn to settle on their own. Does playing white noise via an app or speaker help Research has shown it helps babies fall asleep within five minutes and that they sleep for longer stretches while its on. However there is still debate around this. Some argue that it creates a womblike environment that is calming others that it damages infant hearing and a few that it affects the brainstem in a way that causes infants to shut down so a freeze reflex rather than fall asleep says Ball. I dont think we have a clear grasp on what white noise is doing neurologically to a baby and until we do I dont think it should be recommended but if parents choose to use it then duration and loudness should be limited to reduce impact on infant hearing development. Its not a good idea she warns to play white noise through your phone and leave it right next to the babys cot. Toddlers and young children One of the big requirements for sleep at any age is that we feel safe and for a baby feeling safe involves knowing their parent is close by. But as your child gets older they need to learn to sleep alone. When it comes to how much sleep is needed parents should focus on the quality of the sleep not the quantity and let children follow their own instincts says Professor Russell Foster director of the sleep and circadian neuroscience institute at the University of Oxford in his new book Life Time The New Science of the Body Clock and How It Can Revolutionize Your Sleep and Health. He says that attuning to our natural circadian rhythm can dramatically improve sleep. What matters is regularity he says. Exposure to morning light and regular mealtimes are important. If your child shows signs of irritability thats a sign they may not be getting enough sleep at night. Dont be concerned if your child seems to need a lot of sleep. I dont think one should necessarily worry about some kids needing 10 hours 11 hours or maybe even more in the preteens says Foster. When it comes to naps a new study has tried to shed light on why some four or fiveyearolds love a daily snooze while some threeyearsolds might have stopped entirely. It shows that when young children have an immature hippocampus it reaches a limit of memories that can be stored without them being forgotten triggering the need for sleep. When the hippocampus is more developed the suggestion is that children are able to hold on to memories until the end of the day when overnight sleep can do its work in moving memories to the cerebral cortex which plays a key role in memory. And remember babies and small children develop at very different rates so while its helpful to know why dont worry if your child is taking a while to wean off a daytime nap if their body says theres a need for it and theyre sleeping well at night trust in nature. Young teens Teens arent just being lazy when they dont want to get up in the morning there is a genuine biological change in how we sleep. As we move through adolescence we shift towards an evening or owl chronotype the natural inclination of your body to sleep at a certain time meaning well want to stay up and wake up later. Its unsurprising then that secondary school years can be a battlefield. We see a lot of young people quite sleepdeprived because the way our schools work isnt conducive to this kind of sleep cycle says Stephanie Romiszewski director of Sleepyhead Clinic. Children are not going to do as well in those morning periods when theyre still waking up. Light exposure is key. Walking all or part of the way to school in daylight will be helpful. And new research has found that when teens were exposed to two and a half hours of bright light therapy a light therapy box that mimics outdoor light in the morning it helped cue the internal clock to wake teens up a little earlier a shift should also make it easier for them to fall asleep at an appropriate time. We all know that ditching screens before bed aids sleep but its not for the reasons we might assume. While it is often claimed that blue light is detrimental to sleep Foster says that the brightness is extremely unlikely to affect the bodys sleep clock because the screen light is not strong enough. Rather its the effect that flicking through our emails and news feeds has on stimulating our brain that makes it harder to get to sleep. So put screens away at least 30 minutes before bedtime. While there is now a booming market for melatonin the sleeppromoting hormone supplements marketed at children longerterm studies on their use in the general population are lacking. Most of the studies have been done on children with neurodevelopmental disorders and in those cases theyre often very helpful. For other kids according to a new study you might be better off investing in a weighted blanket as they can help activate brain regions that can influence the release of melatonin. Older teens From the age of 18 onwards we should be getting at least seven hours of sleep a night. Alcohol is also likely to come into the mix at this stage but there are things we can do to mitigate its impact on sleep. If you go to bed with a stomach full of alcohol either your body wont metabolise it and youll wake up drunk or youll metabolise it in your sleep and your sleep will be awful says Romiszewski. Youre better off drinking earlier in the evening and having plenty of water so theres time for metabolisation to take place. For young people who have just left school and are now managing their own schedules at university or work maintaining a regular sleeping pattern can be tricky. A study of undergraduates found that those who kept irregular bedtimes had poorerquality sleep than those with more consistent sleep schedules even though they got roughly the same amount overall. Irregular sleep was also associated with poorer academic performance so try to go to bed at a similar time each night. With all aspects of sleep regularity is helpful so even if you cant manage it in the short term try to make it your aim. Many experts are cautious about the vogue for using sound as a sleep aid but Russell Foster says it could be helpful for students who are up against it with academic work and unable to sleep because of the noise of others partying downstairs. Silence he says is probably the best backdrop to sleep but at some stages in our lives a soundtrack could be helpful. Theres a whole range of sounds to try including white noise which covers all frequencies equally eg a fan or a vacuum cleaner pink noise lowerpitched constant gentler eg wind rustling through the trees or waves on a beach and brown noise deeper still rumbling sounds eg heavy rain or a rushing river. 20s and 30s At this age having weathered the years of late nights and getting by on too little sleep it makes sense to get yourself into good habits. Ramlakhan recommends what she calls five nonnegotiables for better sleep. This is a gamechanger do them for seven to 10 days to reset the nervous system she says. Habit one is to always eat breakfast within 30 to 45 minutes of rising this stabilises the blood sugar for the day ahead. Number two dont use caffeine as a substitute for meals and reduce its use generally if you need to. Three drink plenty of water through the day at least 1. 5 litres because being dehydrated can lead to sleep problems says Ramlakhan. Four get to bed early three times a week 9. 30 or 10pm is perfect. This is the sweet spot where nature is setting us up for sleep she says. And five cultivate a healthy relationship with technological devices and dont scroll on your phone immediately before turning off the light. Ideally dont have the phone in your bedroom at all says Ramlakhan. As we age our bodies secrete less of two important sleep hormones melatonin and growth hormone so well naturally be getting less deep sleep compared with our teen years. Compounding this we might find ourselves juggling work commitments and busy social lives. Social jetlag which occurs when we go to bed later and wake up later at the weekend is common and can lead to weight gain reduced mental performance and chronic illness. And while weekend lieins have their place its important to be aware that if you feel you need them its possibly because youve had insufficient sleep during the week. Everyone knows that problems can affect a persons sleep. If you have major life worries seeing a therapist could improve your sleep patterns. So could journalling especially at bedtime one study found it reduced bedtime worrying and helped people fall asleep more quickly. They also slept longer than the participants who didnt journal before bed. Most people with a sleep problem are actually experiencing an anxiety or stress problem says Foster. Thats at the root of most problems with sleep he says. Theres huge anxiety about sleep and thats being driven by misinformation you get people screaming that you have to have eight hours sleep or you die. But in fact sleep is highly dynamic its like shoe size and one size doesnt fit all. Of the many apps and devices on the market that aim to measure your sleep habits Fosters advice is not to take them too seriously. There are some deeply inaccurate apps out there he says. Something that says you had a good night of sleep or a bad one can be misleading. The last thing you want is anything that reinforces any anxiety you might have around sleep. And try to avoid routinely reaching for sleeping pills he says. They dont provide a biological mimic for sleep they are sedatives and may even interfere with some of the important processes that occur during sleep such as memory formation and the processing of information. This doesnt mean theyre not helpful in the shortterm for acute situations if youve suffered a bereavement for example you might need to take them for a few days to get some rest. Foster emphasises the importance that the timing of our meals has in helping us get a good nights sleep advising that people should have a big breakfast a hearty lunch and a light and early dinner he suggests 8pm is a good cutoff point for eating. This is because our ability to process food glucose for example is much more efficient during the first half of the day. When we eat late the muscles that digest and metabolise our food have to keep working when they should be resting. Mid life Its no secret that the night sweats associated with perimenopause and menopause can wreak havoc on sleep. Browning recommends keeping a spare pair of pyjamas next to the bed sleeping on a towel and using two single duvets instead of a double if youre sleeping with a partner so you can choose a different tog and throw it off if it gets too hot. Diet makes a definite difference. A study carried out by researchers at Harvard recently found that the risk of developing insomnia for menopausal women was higher among those who ingested more carbs so a diet rich in fruit and vegetables can reduce the chances. But the big question is if you find yourself waking up and not going back to sleep should you stay under the covers or get up The answer says Dr Aric Prather author of the newly published The SevenDay Sleep Prescription is that it depends on whether this is a temporary issue or a chronic problem. If the former stay in bed and try not to worry too much because your body will be able to cope with the occasional bad night. But if its happening on a regular basis it means youve created what he calls conditioned arousal. Often people say I was feeling sleepy but I got into bed and my brain woke up he says. In other words your body is confused about how to get to sleep and when you start to feel anxious about going to bed because you fear you wont sleep youre setting up a vicious circle that can be hard to break. If this is you Prathers advice is to get out of bed and engage in some activity that helps you wind down reading watching a TV programme or film that youve seen before listening to gentle music or a guided meditation. The aim is to bring on the feeling of drowsiness and then you go back to bed he says. But if the problem is longterm he suggests using strict rules about when you can go to bed and when you rise. Imagine a balloon that inflates through the day he says. This is your sleep balloon and you need to start filling it up from the morning. He recommends getting up at the same time however little sleep you think youve had it will make all the difference to how tired you feel later. At the other end of the day push back on when you go to bed so between the two says Prather youll ensure your sleep balloon is as full as possible. What youre aiming for is that your sleep balloon is really big he says. You want to be watching the clock waiting to go to bed because you feel really sleepy. And thats a new experience for someone with insomnia. Sleeping with someone else is generally speaking a bonus new research suggests that individuals in shared beds experience less severe insomnia and fatigue and have more sleep time its possible that having another adult in the bed makes people feel safer on some level. Testosterone levels naturally decline with age in males and some studies have shown lower testosterone to be associated with worse sleep and greater problems with sleep apnoea a breathing disorder. Later life As we get older sleep gets lighter and periods of sleep tend to be shorter. The biggest changes are to the elements of sleep that keep us most rested slowwave or deep sleep which largely happens in the first half of the night and reduces as we get older says John Groeger professor of psychology at Nottingham Trent University. While its natural to wake briefly several times a night the reduction in deep sleep means we do so more often and for longer as we age. Sleep Groeger points out is closely linked to the demands being made on our brains and our bodies when were younger were growing and learning a huge amount and sleep fuels all this. As we get older the ageing body is doing less and sleep needs are reduced. Studies have found that sleep patterns in later life can be a factor in dementia people who slept six hours or less a night in their 50s and 60s were more likely to develop dementia later on. Inactivity says Groeger is a big enemy of sleep and while its possible to be inactive at any age it may be a particular issue when youre older. Physical exertion especially in the morning and outside in the daylight is a health boon on many levels including as an excellent primer for a good nights sleep. Its important to remember he says that sleep is a reflection of our lives if we have balance in our mental and physical health if were getting exercise and not carrying too much excess weight if were in tune with those around us and were reasonably happy in the choices weve made in our lives sleep is going to be easier whatever age we are.

In an Instagram post on Tuesday Atsuko Sato the Japanbased owner of Kabosu revealed that the 17yearold shiba inu has chronic lymphocytic leukemia a type of blood and bone marrow cancer and cholangiohepatitis an inflammation of the bile ducts gallbladder and liver tissue. Right now the liver level is very bad and jaundice appears said Sato. Nevertheless Kabosu has an appetite and is able to drink water she said. In 2013 Kabosu became an internet sensation based on a 2010 photo that Sato posted to her blog. The picture shows Kabosu with her paws crossed slightly sideeyeing the camera with a little smirk. The meme is notably accompanied with captions of terse expressions and broken English such as wow so scare and much respect. Since then Kabosu and her Doge meme have gone viral with even the recently launched cryptocurrency Dogecoin being inspired by the meme. In 2021 the Doge meme was sold as a nonfungible token or NFT for a staggering 4m making it the most expensive meme NFT to ever be sold. In a post earlier this week Sato said that Kabosu had been sick since Christmas Eve and was unable to eat or drink water. Sato then said in another post that Kabosu had blood tests done and that her doctor informed her that Kabosu was in very dangerous condition. I didnt expect it to be that bad Sato wrote. Pictures and videos posted online by Sato show Kabosu lying underneath a blanket. In one post Sato is seen attempting to give Kabosu water from a bottle. There has been an outpouring of good wishes towards Kabosu with many online wishing the shiba inu a speedy recovery. Its gonna be alrite you have the world praying for you stray strong Kabosu one user wrote. Other users addressed Kabosu by her internet nickname saying It will be okay doge and Doge we are here for you. On average shiba inus have a lifespan of 12 to 15 years.
"Tail does not wag the dog when it comes to agility, scientists find","Dogs’ tails not critical for complex manoeuvres, with ‘little to no effect’ when jumping, researchers say After decades of research into man’s best friend, scientists have concluded that the tail cannot, in fact, wag the dog.An international team decided to i…",2023-01-02T17:05:12Z,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/02/tail-does-not-wag-the-dog-when-it-comes-to-agility-scientists-find,After decades of research into mans best friend scientists have concluded that the tail cannot in fact wag the dog. An international team decided to investigate the purpose of the dogs tail after studies showed that numerous animals from lizards to squirrels used their tails to pull off impressive manoeuvres such as righting themselves midair when falling from trees. While cats dont need a tail to flip themselves over and land on their feet they do use their tails for balance and as counterweights to perform extreme hunting moves in the wild including rapid tight turns to keep up with their prey. With dogs more inclined to stay on the ground scientists were unclear whether the animals tails helped with agile movements or primarily served as waggable communication devices andor to fend off unwanted visitors such as flies. To learn more Dr Ardian Jusufi who studies animal locomotion at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Stuttgart and his colleagues built a mathematical model that allowed them to check what happens when dogs twist and turn their torsos and move their legs and tails when they bound into the air. Their conclusions appear in a preprint titled Tail wags the dog is unsupported by biomechanical modelling of Canidae tails use during terrestrial motion. In the paper which has not been peerreviewed the researchers describe how the modelling showed tail movements made almost no difference to a dogs trajectory when it leapt into the air. The finding suggests that tails are not as critical for agile movements in dogs as they are for other animals. Moving the tail midjump the researchers found changed the dogs trajectory by a mere fraction of a degree. Across the dog family It appears the inertial impacts that tail movement has on complex manoeuvres such as jumping have little to no effect the authors write. The utilising of the tail during jumping achieves very low amounts of centre of mass movement across all species with the largest being under a single degree. We believe that this implies that dogs utilise their tails for other means such as communication and pest control but not for agility in manoeuvres they add. According to previous research dogs use their tails to communicate everything from dominance and friendliness to fear and appeasement. A tail held high signifies confidence or a dogs willingness to play while a stiff tail can express a threat or anxiety. When the tail is down low or tucked between the legs the animal might be afraid but loose wagging from side to side communicates friendliness.

The only problem Your dog has to stay home. Thankfully you can solve this problem by hiring a pet sitter. Of course you arent going to have anyone watch over your fourlegged friend. Youre going to ask them some questions first. Primarily whats their experience and how often theyll be able to walk your dog You might get asked similar questions by lenders when you apply for loans and credit cards. To find out they might check your credit report. What are credit reports why are they important and what is in them Read on to find out. What is a Credit Report and Why is it Important You can think of a credit report as a snapshot of your financial situation. Specifically it contains active and closed credit accounts the dates when the accounts were opened the type of credit and the payment history of the accounts. Basically a credit report tells you what your financial habits are. Companies may use the data to predict how likely you are to pay back your debts on time. As a result credit reports are crucial for decisions about lending money in the form of credit cards auto loans or mortgages. But thats just scratching the surface. You may also receive different interest rates based on the information on your credit reports. Moreover insurance prices utility deposits and even job applications are affected by your credit history. There are dozens of places where you can obtain your credit report. The three big credit bureaus however are Equifax Experian and TransUnion. Often referred to as credit reporting agencies these companies work independently. As a result each bureau has its own interpretation. Credit Reports vs. Credit Scores Your credit scores are also influenced by your credit reports. The reason for this is that credit scores are calculated using information from your credit report. Essentially your scores summarize the information in your credit report. Nevertheless keep in mind that there are multiple credit reports and scores as well. The information used to calculate scores can differ based on a variety of factors including which bureau provided the information. Whats in Your Credit Report There are a number of elements that make up your credit report including personal information your credit account history and your credit inquiries. Credit bureaus receive this information from your lenders and creditors. FICO Scores are used to determine whether you are a good credit risk for future lenders. Although all credit reports contain basically the same information they are formatted and reported differently by the credit bureaus. And they generally contain the following four categories. Personally Identifiable Information PII Credit reports may contain information about you that identifies you such as Your name and any nicknames you have used with a credit account. A list of current and previous addresses. Date of birth. Social Security number. Phone numbers. Information about past and current employment. What to look for when viewing PII. Is your name spelled correctly Do you see your current address on the report Make sure the digits on your Social Security Number are not transposed incorrectly. Dispute any incorrect information with the credit bureaus that have this information on their reports. The Personal Statements section might also include items such as a security freeze fraud alert or power of attorney comments. If you are submitting a personal statement ensure that it is accurate. Credit Accounts Information about your borrowing and repayment history can be found under credit accounts in your credit report. This could include credit cards mortgages car loans student loans and mortgages from the past. Additionally each account listing will likely include the following information Account type such as a revolving credit account an installment loan or a mortgage. The name of the lender. Loan amount or credit limit. The balance of your account. History of payments. If applicable the date of opening and closing. You may also be able to view any collection activity recorded by the credit bureau. In some agencies people with credit accounts are listed separately while in others they are listed together. What to look for when viewing credit accounts Your account is in good standing if you have made payments on time and adhered to your creditors terms. Even though your report states you are in good standing make sure you are aware of the account verify the name and number and that the date of opening balance payment status and payment history match. In negative accounts payment information is displayed about accounts that have not been paid. All account information should be accurate including the account number and recent balance as well as past due amounts and payment histories. Dont hesitate to contact the credit bureaus andor creditors if you notice anything thats not right. Credit Inquiries On your credit report you may find two kinds of inquiries. There is only one factor that can influence your credit scores however. Having your credit report checked by a lender after applying for a loan will result in a hard inquiry. Typically they involve extending credit or lending money. Depending on your credit score hard inquiries can appear on your credit report for two years. When you do the following you might trigger a hard inquiry Apply for a credit card or loan. Increase your credit line. Apply for a mortgage or rent a house or apartment. Sign up for a phone cable or internet service. Unlike hard inquiries soft inquiries do not affect your credit scores. They are however recorded on your credit report for a period of two years. And a soft inquiry does not appear on a potential lenders credit report. You may receive a soft inquiry if Do a credit check on yourself. Obtain an insurance quote. Take part in a background check for a job you are interested in. Receive a prequalification or preapproval credit card offer. What to look for in credit inquiries In addition to checking your credit report you should make sure that there are no funny business transactions going on. See if your credit has been checked and if it was shared only with you or with others. Your credit report will list the creditors name business type and inquiry date. Consult the credit bureaus if you see a suspicious business name or are confused about why a specific company checked your credit. Public Records You may also see negative information on your credit report based on information reported in public records. Examples include Bankruptcies. Foreclosures. Tax liens. Civil suits and court judgments. Overdue child support. If you see a debt collection on your credit report dont panic. Despite the fact that there are no quick fixes for repairing your credit there are things you can do to improve your FICO score. For example getting current on missed payments. What to look for in public records A Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays on your credit report for 10 years after its filed. On the hand after seven years a Chapter 13 bankruptcy can be wiped out. In case either of these appears on your report remember this. When applying for credit always verify that the information on your credit report is accurate so that your lender sees the most accurate FICO Score. It is your responsibility to notify the appropriate credit bureau of any errors on your report. What Credit Bureaus Arent Telling You Our Financial Surveillance System Consumer credit bureaus track consumers credit histories including their payment history and overall debt load. However they may also track everything from bouncing a check to applying for health insurance as well. In any one of these everyday scenarios theres a good chance your information is being logged crossreferenced bought sold and scored among a sprawling network of consumer data brokers writes Adam Hardy for Money. And that data can be used against you when it comes time to apply for a loan land a job rent a place to live and even innocuous things like sign up for a new phone plan. Financial information not related to debt. Additionally the bureaus maintain information about consumers home addresses and employment records that have nothing to do with credit notes MarketWatch. Lenders use this data to evaluate borrowers when they apply for credit even denying them a loan without calculating credit scores. According to Louis Hyman an assistant professor of consumercredit history at Cornell University people who move addresses often may be considered less financially stable and harder to track down if they owe unpaid debts. A similar scenario can be seen with people who change jobs frequently he says. Consumers home addresses and employment records are also kept by the bureaus. Lenders can use this information to evaluate borrowers when they apply for credit even to reject them. How often you move. Louis Hyman an assistant professor at Cornell University and a consumercredit historian says that people who change their addresses often are believed to be less financially stable. In the same way those who change jobs frequently might miss payments more often. Credit bureaus say this information is crucial for accurate credit reports. According to Consumer Data Industry Association spokesman Norm Magnuson consumers addresses help bureaus identify the right credit report to provide lenders. Since some consumers do not provide social security numbers social security numbers alone will not suffice. Despite consumer protection laws the CDIA cannot comment on lender underwriting practices. Your salary. It is also possible to obtain information about consumers salaries. For example in 2007 Equifax acquired a datamining company which provided it with information on more than 33 of U. S. adults. Equifax maintains a private database of salary records for 33 of U. S. adults. This information can be used by mortgage and car finance companies to evaluate the ability of consumers to repay loans. According to Equifaxs spokesman Timothy Klein the company discloses salary information only when permitted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act which was passed in 1970 and regulates how consumer data can be shared. As stated in a company statement to Congress the company is in compliance with all applicable consumer protection laws. According to him this data will only be provided to lenders with consumer consent. Keeping Track of Your Every Move Theres no way to completely opt out of becoming part of this financial data matrix since you probably didnt ask to be included. In other words you should watch the watchmen. However it might be a good idea to clear your schedule. To get a better sense of how daunting this task is I pulled several of my own reports adds Hardy. The CFPB keeps a list of roughly 60 of the largest consumerreporting companies. I chose six of them the big three ChexSystems The Work Number an employmenthistory agency owned by Equifax and LexisNexis a data firm that tracks property bankruptcy and other public records. It took Hardy about five hours to pull these six reports. I had to ace timed multiplechoice questionnaires he adds. Getting the answer wrong would lock me out he says. Because my requests for reports were not working properly on the companys website I sent multiple emails to the help desk. To access my employmenthistory report I had to send in scans of a recent pay stub and my drivers license over an encrypted email service Hardy states. In most cases I received a digital copy of my report once I cleared the gauntlet Hardy continues. But some companies only send reports through snail mail so it can easily take weeks to compile everything. The breadth of my consumer files was eyeopening. Among the information in the reports were past jobs about a dozen previous addresses email addresses phone numbers salaries debts assets and more. In some cases the information was incredibly specific My employment report for instance included a breakdown of the number of hours I worked each week when I was a server at a quasiFrench restaurant in 2013. Mistakes Caused by Big Data are Bigger Additionally consumer reporting agencies can convince landlords employers banks and insurance companies that their dossiers are necessary. According to Nelson from the National Consumer Law Center more than 90 of employers and landlords use reporting agencies to run consumer background checks. Sure it makes sense that the person screening my job or apartment application would want to know if I have an open felony Hardy adds. But do they really need to know my credit score or my past four telephone numbers or the fact that I got a traffic ticket in 2015 which I contested in court and won by the way or how many hours I logged in that parttime job a decade ago It gets worse. A paper in the spring 2022 issue of the American Business Law Journal suggests that credit bureaus and financial technology companies gather more behavioral and lifestyle information to determine creditworthiness including SAT scores and social media posts. The scope of data thats out there says Lindsay Sain Jones a legal studies professor at the University of Georgia and coauthor of the report is sort of mindblowing. This is what Jones refers to as alternative fringe data collection which is gathered right from the web without the consent of consumers. In many cases the use of this data is disguised as helping unbanked or credit invisible populations which tend to be racial and socially disadvantaged. Until now this practice has not been widely adopted but that could change as more CRAs adopt an any data is credit data approach. Were concerned about how more and more information is making its way into these models says Sophie Sahaf a deputy assistant director at the CFPB and what that means for surveillance risk for consumers and intrusion into their lives. A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA consumer reporting agencies are required to maintain accurate fair and private information.

"Homeward Bound! Dog, found 1,600 miles away, will be home for Christmas","The german shepherd mix went missing in October 2021. Now, the friendly pooch is on a cross-country road trip from Kansas to California, back to the family who adopted him as an abandoned puppy.",2022-12-21T10:10:39Z,https://www.npr.org/2022/12/21/1144581887/dog-zeppelin-found-kansas-sacramento,Homeward Bound Dog found 1600 miles away will be home for Christmas Zeppelin a threeyearold German shepherd mix whos become a minor celebrity over the last few days is about to be reunited with his family both adopted and sired just in time for Christmas. The friendly pooch went missing from his home in West Sacramento Calif. more than a year ago said And then last week I get a call and hes in Kansas she told NPR. Through a peal of a laughter ONeill added I was floored. Just shocked when they told me. Zeppelins mysterious odyssey Exactly how Zeppelin named after one of ONeills favorite bands Led Zeppelin ended up 1600 miles away from home remains a mystery. But ONeill said shes got a theory. In the months before the dogs disappearance he would roam from ONeills vast rural spread to a construction site about a mile away where the crew would feed him treats and give him lots of pets and attention. This dog has never met a stranger in his life she said fondly. Hes a very outgoing loving dog. So every day hed go down there and either hed come home on his own or I would go out to get him. But on the evening of Oct. 19 2021 Zeppelin was nowhere to be found. Panicked ONeill said she looked in all of Zeppelins usual spots to no avail. In the days the followed she kept returning to the construction site. But again no one had seen him. She turned to Facebook posting on every missingdog group she could think of. So did her friends. In the end ONeill said I have no proof but I think somebody down there fell in love with him and took him home. A whispered prayer Over the intervening months she didnt dare let herself consider the worstcase scenario. Instead she focused on the fact that Zeppelin had been microchipped and held out hope that someday a vet might figure out that the gregarious dog had a family waiting for him. ONeill and her husband live on a big farm with loads of animals. They have horses goats chickens cats and a handful of abandoned dogs theyve rescued. But Zeppelin was always in her thoughts she said. Just the other night my husband and I were driving past the old construction site and I said a little prayer. I hope youre somewhere safe she whispered to herself. The next morning ONeill got a call from the microchip company telling her Zeppelin had been found in Louisburg Kan. A woman had found the dog on her property one night and took him to the vet to get him checked out. I am just so grateful for all of the good folks along the way who have helped in trying to get this puppy home to us she said. Heros welcome for a returning doggy daddy Zeppelin will be receiving a heros welcome on Wednesday morning according to ONeill who describes herself as a private and somewhat shy person. A woman named Mary Hastings volunteered to drive him home after visiting her daughter in Kansas. Im sure hes going to love every minute of it. He loves car rides ONeill said. Theres going be a press conference. Its going to be a media circus she added laughing. But I cant wait to see him. Weve missed him so much Still shes most delighted by the idea of Zeppelins own family reunion. Before embarking on the grand odyssey he sired a litter of puppies. They were just weeks old when he vanished and while ONeill gave away most she kept two Angus and Sweet Pea. Now after the equivalent of about 13 dog years they will all be together again. He was the best doggy daddy ONeill exclaimed. Hes going to be so happy.
