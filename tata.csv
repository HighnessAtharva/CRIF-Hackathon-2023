With total sales of 50000 electric cars to date Indias Tata Motors dominates the countrys EV market and has outlined plans to launch 10 electric models by March 2026. The company expects electric models to make up a quarter of its total sales by 2025 from around 8 now. Localising cell manufacturing for EV batteries is key to increasing local components in electric cars and will help the automaker develop a local supply chain too Tata Motors P. B. Balaji said on the sidelines of Indias Auto Expo car show in Greater Noida in Utter Pradesh. Tata is evaluating two production bases the other one is in Europe so that the battery cell needs of its luxury car unit Jaguar Land Rover which has a manufacturing facility there can also be met. Balaji said the investment in cell manufacturing will be made by its parent company Tata Sons but did not elaborate on the quantum or timeline. We should announce it sooner rather than later he said. Indias car market set to become the thirdlargest in the world is tiny compared to its population with electric models making up just 1 of total car sales of about 3. 8 million last year but the government wants to grow this to 30 by 2030. Tata expects its EV business to be cash flow positive by 2025 while the company is also focused on boosting profitability of the business Balaji said. Tatas new models will include a wider driving range and higher price points as Tata Motors looks to cement its lead at a time when rivals such as Mahindra Mahindra MAHM.

Air India's handling of unruly passenger on flight 'unprofessional ... - Reuters,India's aviation regulator on Thursday issued a notice to some Tata Group-owned Air India officials for failing to comply with norms of handling unruly passengers following an incident on one of its flights last year.,2023-01-05T13:11:00Z,https://www.reuters.com/world/india/air-indias-handling-unruly-passenger-flight-unprofessional-regulator-2023-01-05/,Air India criticised by regulator over handling of unruly passenger on flight NEW DELHI Jan 5 Reuters Air India faced criticism on Thursday from the aviation regulator for its handling of an unruly passenger on a flight from New York in November and also acknowledged that a second similar incident occurred last month on a flight from Paris to Delhi. Air India had said in a statement released on Wednesday that it had banned a male passenger for 30 days in compliance with regulations following an incident on a Nov. 26 flight from New York to Delhi in which the man while apparently inebriated urinated on a fellow female passenger. The airline which is owned by Tata Group said it had reported the matter to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation DGCA Indias air safety watchdog for further action. DGCA however said on Thursday that it had sought details from the airline on the incident but at first glance it appeared that Air India had not complied with provisions related to the handling of an unruly passenger onboard. The conduct of the concerned airline appears to be unprofessional and has led to a systemic failure DGCA said in its statement. The watchdog said it had issued a notice to the airlines executives and the pilots and cabin crew members on the flight asking them to explain within two weeks why action should not be taken against them for failing to uphold regulations. It did not respond to a request for comment seeking details on what action it had expected the airline to take. Air India did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters on the DGCA notice. In 2017 India issued new standards barring unruly passengers from flying for a minimum of three months to more than two years depending on the nature of the misdemeanour. Air India reported on Thursday a second incident which took place on a Dec. 6 fight from Paris to Delhi during which a male passenger urinated on a vacant seat and the blanket of another passenger. Air India added that the male passenger on the Paris flight had been taken into custody on arrival at Delhi but was later released by federal police after he reached an understanding with the victim and tendered a written apology. The airline said it did not lodge a police report in deference to the victims wishes. Our Standards The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

The German luxury carmakers sales in India rose 41 last year to 15822 cars its highest ever in the country and it has an order backlog of around 6000 vehicles Santosh Iyer managing director for MercedesBenz India told Reuters. One risk to the growth of Indias luxury car market is a weakening Indian currency which could force Mercedes to increase domestic prices as imported components get pricier he said. The rupee fell 10 against the dollar in 2022 its steepest drop since 2013 making it the one of the worst performing Asian currencies. One of the biggest risks we see for us is the exchange rate. With the rupee weakening a bit more that will lead us to more price increases. So thats some headwind we see when it comes to the growth potential Iyer said.

Indian outfit Tata is reportedly getting ready to take over an iPhone manufacturing plant making it the first Indianowned plant of its kind. The plant is currently owned by Taiwanese company Wistron with the pair said to be working on getting a deal over the line before the end of March. Its thought that Tata is now in line to take over the majority share of a joint venture between the two companies. Itll also oversee manufacturing. An Indian first Bloomberg opens in new tab reports that the reason Tata wants to take over the plant before the end of March is simple its when a chunk of money is set to be handed out. The Indian conglomerate aims to complete a due diligence process by March 31 so that its Tata Electronics arm can formally take over Wistrons position in a program that gives it government incentives Bloomberg notes. The next cycle of incentives will begin from April 1 which marks the start of Indias financial year. The news comes as Apple further diversifies its iPhone supply chain to reduce its reliance on Chinese and Taiwanese companies and labor. Apples iPhone supplies have been hit thanks to ongoing COVID19 concerns in China recently with one Foxconn factory also experiencing worker riots. Things got so bad at the Zhengzhou plant that Apple had to get involved. It didnt help that the plant is the only one on the planet that assembles Apples best iPhone the iPhone 14 Pro. While it isnt immediately clear what impact Tatas ownership of this southern Indian plant will have on Apple it is far from the only one in the country.

Its vintage years were the 1930s 50s and 70s when world champions were eager to compete while Englands Sir George Thomas and Hugh Alexander scored stunning upsets. The home contingent started slowly at the Caplin Hastings Masters 202223 before a surge in the second half put five English players in the mix at the start of Fridays 10th and final round. Final leading scores were Sarunas Sulskis Lithuania 810 Mark Hebden England Bence Korpa Hungary and Oleg Korneev Spain all 7. 5 Martin Petrov Bulgaria Romain douard France Conor Murphy Ireland Timo Kppers Germany Brandon Clarke and Danny Gormally England all 7. Sulskis 50 a fivetime Lithuanian champion won his first six games and at that stage was 1. 5 points ahead of 14 players tied for second. Then the pack overtook him and the critical moment for the entire tournament came in Thursdays ninth round when Hebden established a won rook endgame. White Sulskis Kf2 Rh5. Black Hebden Kb5Rb3 Pa4. The black king is in check and Kb4 with the idea Rh4 Ka5 Rh5 Rb5 would win. Instead Hebden retreated with Kb6 when Ke2 allowed the white king to stop the a pawn. In the final round Sulskis won smoothly. For Hebden 64 second prize still crowned a glorious few months during which he won team and individual golds for England at the world and European senior championships. He was joint winner at Hastings in 200910 and his zestful finalround attack on Friday overcame the reigning British champion Harry Grieve. Apart from the trio who finished at the top the main English success story was Mohammed Aayan Ismail the 2021 British under16 champion. Despite his lowly 1963 Fide rating Ismail played a strong tournament missed his first IM norm by only half a point and won a fine strategic game against a seasoned IM. Hastingss venerable tradition continues with sponsorship backing from etrading technology firm Caplin Systems and longstanding support from Hastings Council although its main event the Caplin Hastings Masters is now an opentoall Swiss System tournament. In its heyday it was an invitation 10player allplayall in which four or five British masters fought to scavenge the occasional half point and the rare full point from the world elite. Nowadays that elite chases the high prize funds of the World Rapid and Blitz followed by the chess Wimbledon at Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee which starts on Saturday 14 January with Magnus Carlsen as top seed. Stockholms Rilton Cup clashes directly with Hastings and two of Englands young grandmaster norm chasers Matthew Wadsworth and Jonah Willow preferred Sweden to Sussex. Long ago when Thomas the badminton baronet scored his finest result at Hastings 193435 he tied for first with Max Euwe and Salo Flohr after defeating the past and future world champions Jos Ral Capablanca and Mikhail Botvinnik in successive rounds. It could have been better still but Thomass West London clubmate Reginald Michell defeated his colleague in the final round. The result was greeted at the time as a fine example of British sportsmanship whereas today many would regard it as quixotic. 3849 1Qc4 2 Kg1 2 Ke1 Qe2 mate Qg8 3 Kf1 3 Kh1h2 Qg2 mate Qg2 4 Ke1 Qg1 and 5Qxb1 wins. An extra point for Nakamura would have produced a tie with Carlsen

The two firms discussed various potential tieups but talks have now centered on Tata taking a majority of a joint venture the people said. Tata is set to oversee the main manufacturing operation with support from Wistron the people said asking not to be named because the plans arent public. Apple Inc. s iPhones are mainly assembled by Taiwanese manufacturing giants like Wistron and Foxconn Technology Group. Tatas deal would advance Indias efforts to create local contenders to challenge Chinas dominance in electronics which has been jeopardized by political tensions with the US and Covidrelated hurdles. The Indian conglomerate aims to complete a due diligence process by March 31 so that its Tata Electronics arm can formally take over Wistrons position in a program that gives it government incentives one of the people said. The next cycle of incentives will begin from April 1 which marks the start of Indias financial year. The acquisition could value Wistrons only iPhone manufacturing operation in India at more than 600 million if the Taiwanese company meets the requirements to receive the expected incentives for the current financial year one of the people said. A Tata representative declined to comment. Wistron and Apple didnt respond to requests for comment. I am not directly involved in that but it should be really good for India because this is going to create an opportunity in India to manufacture electronics and microelectronics said N Ganapathy Subramaniam operating chief at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. the IT giant thats Tatas biggest listed unit. A deal would mark a step toward establishing India as a cuttingedge electronic manufacturing base said Subramaniam who is brother to Tata Group Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran. Wistron is one of three Taiwanese iPhone manufacturers in India along with Foxconn and Pegatron Corp. It has sought to diversify its business beyond thinmargin iPhone manufacturing into areas such as servers agreeing to sell its iPhone production business in China to a competitor in 2020. Yet even as Wistron plans to exit iPhonemaking in India its Taiwanese peers are expanding their iPhone production lines. Apple the worlds most profitable smartphone maker is seeking to reduce its dependence on China where pandemicrelated supply chain snarls and draconian restrictions have wrought havoc on device production. Wistrons 2. 2 million squarefoot factory is located just over 30 miles 50 kilometers east of Bangalore. If the acquisition goes through Tata will take over all its eight iPhone lines as well as the plants 10000 workers including a couple thousand engineers. Wistron would continue as a service partner for iPhones in India. Tata has taken other steps to increase its business with Apple. It has accelerated hiring in its factory in Hosur near Bangalore where it produces iPhone components. That plant stands on several hundred acres of land where Tata could add iPhone manufacturing lines in the coming years. Tata has also announced that it will launch 100 Apple stores in the country of 1. 4 billion the first of which is set to open in Mumbai this quarter. The 150yearold Tata Group makes everything from branded salt and Tetley Tea to steel and Jaguar cars and runs an airline and Starbucks cafs in the country. Its TCS is Asias largest IT outsourcing company and one of Indias most valuable by market capitalization. In the past couple of years Chairman Chandrasekaran has accelerated efforts to make the conglomerate more techcentric with a slew of ecommerce initiatives and a new superapp called Tata Neu. The group is also set to enter chipmaking he said last year. With assistance from Sankalp Phartiyal and Debby Wu.

The company helmed by Chief Executive Officer Pratik Pal is overhauling the strategy to scale up the business profitably they said. The underwhelming performance of a project that Tata Group Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran championed as the future of the 128 billion conglomerate shows the uphill task in taking on entrenched ecommerce rivals such as Amazon. com Inc. and Walmart Inc. s Flipkart. Tata Neu Indias first super app in the pipeline since at least mid2020 was modeled on the lines of Chinas ubiquitous Alipay and WeChat but ran into technical glitches and customer complaints soon after its launch. A spokesperson for Tata Group didnt respond to an email seeking comment. The coffeetocars conglomerate which acquired firms including egrocer Bigbasket and epharmacy 1mg to bolster its ecommerce portfolio has invested more than 2 billion in the past three years one of the people said. But online sales at Croma a Tata Groupowned retailer of electronic goods and Bigbasket which make up a majority of Tata Digitals revenue are expanding slower than projected the person said. Another person attributed the performance to the groups inability to raise cash from investors and fund its plans. The group will also recalibrate performance targets for Tata Neu that were set at the beginning of the year according to the people familiar with the plans. Ferrari Super App The pressure is on the Tata Group to get its super app on the right track before conglomerates led by Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani Asias two richest men launch similar ventures. Adani told the Financial Times in an August interview that he wants his super app due sometime this year to be the Ferrari of the digital world. Tata Sons Pvt. the groups main holding company explored bringing in financial or strategic investors including global technology companies to back the super app Bloomberg reported in 2020. But prospective investors balked at the valuation sought for a business that was still in the making some of the people said. Rather than waiting for investors in Tata Digital the groups new plan is to consider selling stakes in individual businesses that are part of this unit to fund their growth one of the people said. The group is also consolidating its inhouse online platforms. Trent Ltd. last month agreed to sell 3. 22 of Tata Unistore Ltd. which owns etailer Tata Cliq to Tata Digital. Bigbasket may sell shares to the public within three years after securing 200 million in funding its Chief Financial Officer Vipul Parekh told Bloomberg in December.

"Low-key Auto Expo lacked large players, clarity on future tech","Among the passenger vehicle companies, Tata Motors leads the chart by offering a range of EV cars",2023-01-11T22:55:38Z,https://indianexpress.com/article/auto-travel/low-key-auto-expo-lacked-large-players-clarity-on-future-tech-8376459/,A marked lowkey affair the Auto Expo 2023 not only was given a pass by a large number of players including Honda Motor Volkswagen AG and group companies Skoda Auto and Audi Mahindra Mercedes BMW among others the expo also reflected the lack of clarity in the minds of auto players with respect to technology that will dominate the future. Though largely dominated by showcasing of electric vehicles it reflected the hitch among the autoplayers who still seem unsure about the technology that will dominate in the future and still showed their concept cars for future. Barring Tata Motors which has shown a big leap of faith in the Lithiumion based EV technology and launched two new electric SUVs Tata Sierra EV and Tata Harrier EV on Wednesday most companies were still seen showcasing their concept EV vehicles. While Hyundai launched its Ioniq 5 EV model that has already hit other markets and is expected to come at a significant premium over its existing product the Kona Maruti Suzuki showcased the eVX its EV concept that should be ready to hit the market in 2025. The first day of auto expo which traditionally used to witness launch of multiple new internal combustion engine ICE cars by companies across the spectrum there was none by atleast the three leading manufacturers on the first day Maruti Suzuki Hyundai and Tata Motors. Maruti Suzuki is however expected to launch Jimny miniSUV with a petrol drivetrain at the auto expo on Thursday. Compared to its last edition in 2020 the fifteenth edition of the Expo is bigger in terms of participation with significant representation from electric vehicle startups and original equipment manufacturers OEMs. The latest show recorded a participation from 114 exhibitors out of which 48 are vehicle manufacturers compared to 108 exhibitors and 35 OEMs in the 2020 edition. Over half a dozen entities are manufacturers of only electric passenger vehicles and two and threewheelers.

Tata Industries and An email sent to Tata Digital remained unanswered. The group last week increased the authorised share capital of Tata Digital by Rs 1000 crore to Rs 21000 crore and infused Rs 750 crore into the company as per filings with the Registrar of Companies. In the filings Tata Digital said the authorised capital was increased considering its business plans repayment of debt and the investments to be made from time to time. This was the second time this fiscal year the group expanded the authorised share capital of Tata Digital. In September the company had filed for increasing it to Rs 20000 crore from Rs 15000 crore ahead of a capital infusion of Rs 3462 crore. In March just before the start of this fiscal year the share capital was increased to Rs 15000 crore from Rs 11000 crore. There are very few Tata businesses where funding has been deployed at such a war footing and it shows where the groups priorities lie said Mohit Yadav founder of business intelligence firm AltInfo. The latest round of funding in Tata Digital takes the total funding of the Tata Group in ecommerce to almost Rs 6000 crore. Last fiscal year Tatas had infused around Rs 12000 crore into its ecommerce business. The Tata Group is competing with Amazon Walmartowned Flipkart and Myntra and The group is also burning money in ecommerce much like its rivals.

Tata Motors moving in right direction in terms of profitability and cash flow: Mitul Shah,"​So this also indicates that directionally now company has started moving into the right direction in terms of the profitability and cash flow apart from volume uptick as for volume there is order book pending of more than 2,15,000.",2023-01-10T07:14:46Z,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/tata-motors-moving-in-right-direction-in-terms-of-profitability-and-cash-flow-mitul-shah/articleshow/96876350.cms,There is no question related to the demand situation for next twothree quarters as there are supply side constraints impacting but despite all this adverse situation companys profitability will improve in Q3 and interestingly semiconductor issue also seems to be now slowly getting much better says Mitul Shah Reliance Securities. The Street seems to be a bit surprised by the free cash flow generation which is expected to be 400 million pounds in Q3 forYes that is a very important parameter in fact that is the positive surprise. Volumes were marginally higher than expectation or broadly in line but this free cash flow of 400 million plus is certainly indicating that there would be a decent margin improvement. Also apart from this volume uptick there could be better product mix geography mix which would result into better profitability this time and then only it can turn this positive cash flow otherwise volume improvement is relatively much lower on a sequential basis. So this also indicates that directionally now company has started moving into the right direction in terms of the profitability and cash flow apart from volume uptick as for volume there is order book pending of more than 215000. There is no question related to the demand situation for next twothree quarters as there are supply side constraints impacting but despite all this adverse situation companys profitability will improve in Q3 and interestingly semiconductor issue also seems to be now slowly getting much better. Looking at this guidance coming in Q3 overall impacting the full year FY23 free cash flow guidance what kind of an upside risk do you see on the back of that and given the fact that you said that now semiconductor issues are behind this positive news with respect to free cash flow are you upping your target price or revising your guidance on Tata MotorsWe would not change our target price based on this news. We would wait for more clarity in terms of the detailed financials once the results would be out then we would revisit our estimates. We have buy recommendation and our target price SOTP based target price already at Rs 575 which is a sizable upside from the current level. So that is why we remain positive on the stock and we believe that going forward the situation is improving in other countries as company has highlighted in geographical mix. China has declined because of the COVID despite that company was able to record these volumes. So if China again starts improving then volume would be much better so those type of numbers we would see in coming twothree quarters. Can you explain to us and to our viewers that today when we see this stock higher by 6 what is it based on because the larger part of the story does not change for Tata Motors when it is going to be debtfree the cash flow projections it has provided for all the way till FY25This 6 to 7 upside today that is a positive reaction of course after this news but we have to understand that this stock has underperformed largely in last twothree quarters and stock valuations stock price in absolute terms has come to a level where everything gets captured. All this negativity gets captured and the risk reward becomes favourable. Disclaimer Recommendations suggestions views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Scope for 7-10% uptick in Tata Motors from current levels: Hemang Jani,I think having some sort of a cap on what sort of exposure you are taking when it comes to PSUs would definitely be advisable. This is because when you are going through a turbulent time and 2023 right from the beginning looks like it is going to be a difficu…,2023-01-11T05:14:48Z,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/scope-for-7-10-uptick-in-tata-motors-from-current-levels-hemang-jani/articleshow/96901069.cms,I think there is a case for some sort of a consolidation in Bharti stocks from where we are. It may go through a bit of a correction but I do not see a case for a significant downtick purely on this because at the end of the day the overall ARPU growth story continues to remain intact and that would give some support to the stock says Hemang Jani Equity Strategist Senior Group VP MOFSL. Further good news from Tata Motors as they have completed the acquisition for Indias Sanand plant as well a buy now after the massive underperformance that we have seen pretty much all through last yearI think finally some good news coming through for Tata Motors. More than this Sanand plant acquisition the combination of the positive news flow on JLR some commitment from the management about the free cash flow generation and the revival that we are seeing in the CV business and the passenger vehicle where I think there is a scope for about 7 to 10 kind of an uptick in Tata Motors even from the price at which it is trading today. What do you make of this JP Morgan downgrade which is coming in. They put a target price of 710 which is okay this is I think where the support for the stock was but they are expecting negative surprises on the capex they expect competitive 5G roll outs to gain momentum and they are saying that battle for premium smart phones subscribers is going to way heavy onIt is one of the best performing sector. I think the incremental growth is going to come from 4G to 5G and the premium customers that you have. So we think that given the aggressive positioning that these two companies have taken in terms of pricing the revenue growth or the ARPU growth can moderate. If you look at Bhartis balance sheet because of the kind of capex that they have done it is not looking that strong compared to what it was may be a yearyear and a half back. So I think there is a case for some sort of a consolidation in Bharti stocks from where we are. It may go through a bit of a correction but I do not see a case for a significant downtick purely on this because at the end of the day the overall ARPU growth story continues to remain intact and that would give some support to the stock. Apart from SBI which is the strongest PSU bank Let us keepYes so our take is that BoB and Where isI think with two important launches coming up this year it should be able to go back to a market share of about 4445 and given the fact for the SUVs in the compact SUVs and even for the premium ones the waiting period is still very high which means that there is a lot of demand which boards well for Maruti. And the yen related pressure which was there may be a month back that has actually cooled off so we think that yes this is going to be one of the better performing stocks it is a better demand visibility and good product launch pipeline but do not expect blockbuster return from the valuations at which it is trading at. What 2023 could bring for LTCapex and capital goods is a very big theme and we think that this may go on for some more time. You have Budget around the corner and government is far more aggressive in terms of putting more outlay for capex and infra. Even with the private sector we are seeing definite signs of turnaround which is good for LT. It also has small component of defence where there is a lot of action happening so we would definitely have a positive view on LT as well as some of the other capex related themes like maybe We want to talk about those which are selling passenger cars what would your pecking order beWe would definitely go with Maruti as our first pick followed by Mahindra Mahindra because I think even for Mahindra the pipeline and the overall turnaround that they posted is extremely good. You also have some positive triggers coming through from the tractor side so these are the two names that we would prefer when it comes to passenger vehicle. Let us get either a buy or sell idea from you. So two names we like at this point. One is Samvardhana Motherson the auto component company. We have seen a good amount of turnaround across the auto industry globally particularly passenger vehicles and given the kind of transformation that Motherson has carried out we think that it is extremely well positioned. So we are extremely positive on this one. And the other one is Disclaimer Recommendations suggestions views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

India’s stockmarkets are roaring. They also have serious faults,Investors may have to look elsewhere for diversification,2022-12-20T16:00:49Z,https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/20/indias-stockmarkets-are-roaring-they-also-have-serious-faults,Indias stockmarkets are roaring. They also have serious faults Investors may have to look elsewhere for diversification Few stockmarkets flourished in 2022. Strong performers include ones in commodityexporting countries like Brazil Indonesia and the Gulf states which have benefited from the squeeze on natural resources. They also include an oddity India. The countrys Nifty 50 and Sensex indices reached record highs at the end of November. Indian stocks are up 4 in localcurrency terms this year. Global stocks are down by 20. All this means it is a hopeful time for India. Investors are reconsidering their exposure to China the largest emerging market. Even after a rebound triggered by Chinas reversal of its zerocovid policies the msci China index has fallen by a quarter since the start of 2020 reducing its annual return over the past decade to below 1. To many fund managers desperate for diversification India looks the most promising alternative. Yet the countrys markets face problems that will limit its ability to take up this role. The most straightforward is their size. Indian stockmarkets are worth 3. 4trn less than the 6trn accounted for by stocks in Hong Kong and Chinese firms listed in New Yorklet alone the 10trn in stocks still mostly out of reach to international investors in mainland China. India could only absorb a fraction of any capital redeployed away from Chinese stocks now and an even smaller share of what investors eventually hope to invest in the mainland. Optimists argue that the growth of the Indian economy will solve this problem. it firms like Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services will benefit from outsourcing. The decision by Foxconn a Taiwanese contract manufacturer to produce iPhones and semiconductors in India hints at the potential for larger manufacturing hubs in the future featuring homegrown firms. But there is a problem Indian stocks are expensive. Their forward pricetoearnings ratio of around 22 is more than double Chinese stocks multiple of ten and more than three times Brazilian stocks multiple of seven. They are even pricey compared with Americas techheavy offerings. India is an importer of commodities and the central bank has been forced to raise interest rates in defence of the rupee. This should have reduced valuations the fact that it has not reflects an outbreak of retail mania. The number of participants in Indian markets has more than tripled since the start of 2022. In the same period retail buyers spent a net 3trn rupees 36bn on stocks a stark rise from the minuscule inflows and occasional outflows recorded between 2015 and 2019. Indias economic prospects are strong but 2023 looks likely to be a difficult year around the world. A slump in retail interest could see asset prices tumble. Indias stockmarkets are far more open to foreign investors than mainland Chinas. But when you broaden the lens to look at debt and currency trading its capital markets remain only partly open reflecting anxiety that speculation could destabilise the economy. Raghuram Rajan governor of the Reserve Bank of India rbi in 201316 wanted to internationalise Indias markets and currency. Despite his instincts as a marketminded liberal he made slow progress. In the past year the rbi has reportedly leaned on domestic banks discouraging participation in the offshore rupee market so as to retain more control of the currencys value against the dollar. There are signs that India wants to open up more. In October T. Rabi Sankar deputy governor of the rbi spoke of the need to entice the capital required to fund Indian growth despite the reduced control of domestic monetary policy this would inevitably bring. Yet there are logistical hurdles. In the same month JPMorgan Chase decided not to include India in a widely followed bond index reflecting investor concerns about fiddly registration processes and whether its clearing and settlement systems could handle a surge in inflows. In any case opening up Indias capital markets further would be a brave undertaking at a time when global markets are fragile and American interest rates are rising. India has a compelling story. It offers a vibrant itservices industry a burgeoning domestic tech scene an increasingly attractive location for global manufacturersand strong economic growth. This is enticing when the appeal of its mighty neighbour to the northeast has diminished. But a pricey stockmarket and a tentative approach to opening up is preventing the country from achieving its potential in capital markets. Fund managers desperate for diversification should not rely on India alone.
