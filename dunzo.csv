Uber and Amazon have some of the poorest working conditions for gig workers in India reveals study,"A study by Fairwork India has revealed that Ola, Uber, Amazon, Dunzo and PharmEasy has some of the worst working conditions for their gig workers, who are not given fair pay, fair contracts, fair management, or even fair representation at work.",2022-12-28T05:48:57Z,https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/uber-and-amazon-have-some-of-the-poorest-working-conditions-for-gig-workers-in-india-reveals-study-11885781.html,Mehul Reuben Das Dec 28 2022 112333 IST Several prominent startups in India including Ola Uber Dunzo PharmEasy and Amazon have some of the worst working conditions for gig workers in India revealed a report by Fairwork India. The report assessed several prominent businesses and scored them on the basis of how proactively they worked to create fair working conditions for the lowliest of their workers namely gig economy workers. The study which was conducted in partnership with the University of Oxford said the aforementioned firms failed to provide fair pay fair contracts fair management fair representation or fair working conditions to their gig workers getting a score of zero on 10. On the other hand firms such as Urban Company BigBasket and Flipkart did fairly well. The report gave Urban Company a score of seven out of 10 six to BigBasket five each to Flipkart and Swiggy four to Zomato two to grocery delivery firm Zepto and one to Tiger Globalbacked delivery firm Porter. In its annual report Fairwork India stated that This year only Bigbasket Flipkart and Urban Company were awarded the first point because of the public commitments they have made to paying workers at least the hourly local minimum wage after factoring in workrelated costs. Bigbasket and Urban Company have operationalised this by committing to reimburse the difference between workers earnings per hour and the hourly local minimum wage after costs. Flipkart and Urban Company have committed to basing their pricing structure for workers on the hourly local minimum wage after costs. Flipkart has also undertaken steps to hold its thirdparty service providers to the same commitment the report added. In recent years more and more people have been participating in parttime or gigbased work. Despite this there has been no effort by most companies relying on gig workers to extend the employee benefits that regular employees enjoy to gigeconomy workers. The benefits that gig workers are deprived of include some basics like health insurance. The promise of the flexibility of the digital platform economy raises as many questions about livelihoods as it offers opportunities. We hope the Fairwork report provides the basis for an interpretation of flexibility that allows for not merely the adaptability that platforms seek but also the income and social security that workers lack said Professors Balaji Parthasarathy and Janaki Srinivasan the principal investigators of the team in a statement.

The latest entrant to peak Bengaluru behavior is a man who was so frustrated with dealing with customer care representatives that he sent a delivery service agent to handle his complaint. The hilarious incident was brought to the internets notice by Twitter user Shankar Ganesh. In a tweet he shared how a man residing in Bengaluru hired services from Swiggy Genie or Dunzo to convey his complaint at an Apple Store about a product. When the agent reached the store the customer talked to the Apple representative through his phone instead of making that call himself and saving himself the hassle. A person sent a Dunzo or Swiggy Genie guy to the Imagine Apple Store here and spoke to the staff through his phone to bypass centralized call centers. Just peakbengaluru things I guess read the caption.

Quick commerce apps nudge users to increase order sizes,"Instamart, Zepto, Dunzo, Blinkit offer incentives for orders above Rs 1,000.",2022-12-20T00:30:00Z,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/quick-commerce-apps-nudge-users-to-increase-order-sizes/articleshow/96351798.cms,Instamart and Zepto have been trying to nudge users to increase their order size by offering incentives for orders above Rs 1000. Meanwhile Dunzo has been incentivising customers to opt for a 60minute delivery so it can club multiple orders and reduce burn as ET reported previously. Blinkit and BigBaskets BB Now are the other players in the socalled ultrafast grocery delivery space. The push for higher order value from Swiggy and Zepto comes when funding is hard to come by for high cashburn sectors like quick commerce. Increasing the cart size is one way for quick commerce companies to achieve better unit economics as bigger order sizes would bring the cost of servicing each order down. The average order value for Swiggy Instamart is around Rs 400 according to people aware of the matter while BigBaskets is around Rs 460 according to the firm. According to a report published by brokerage firm Bernstein in February quick commerce companies in India have an average order value of 6 which is roughly Rs 490. This is about half of traditional egrocers in India but the order frequency is much higher. To double down on increasing the order size food and grocery delivery company Swiggy is planning to introduce threewheelers to deliver larger orders to customers a person aware of the matter said. The firm is also sending larger delivery bags to dark stores. Discover the stories of your interest A lot of customers are transferring their monthly baskets to Instamart due to the selection as well as the pricing it offers. To cater to these needs we are adding to our capabilities in the backend the company said in an emailed response to ET. The focus is to keep increasing the average order value Swiggy said. It is because as consumer cohorts mature average order value grows. Zepto did not respond to ETs queries. BigBasket which is a late entrant to the quick commerce segment is expanding the coverage of its quick delivery service BB Now. According to the company BB Now already services about 80 of BigBasket users and will have full coverage in the top 10 cities besides expanding partly in tier 2 cities before the end of February. ET reported on December 8 that the SoftBankbacked food delivery company is laying off around 250 employees this month with further layoffs planned next year. The company has been moving some people out of its Instamart business to other verticals in an effort to reduce burn in its quick commerce business sources briefed on the matter said. If earlier 10 product managers were working on a problem that number has been reduced to around 5 said a source. The company is planning to make do with limited resources for Instamart. Swiggy denied it was restructuring Instamart. Quick commerce platforms like Instamart and others are also increasingly looking at expanding the range of products beyond groceries. Earlier most platforms carried about 30004000 items for quick delivery but that is being increased now. Categories like beauty and pharmaceuticals are among the ones that Swiggy is looking at for Instamart the source quoted above said. It has already started offering products in categories like pharmaceuticals baby care beauty and stationary in select markets. As for the categories were always looking for newer use cases and whitespace in the selection we can bring to users. Gifting stationery pet and baby care are some of the areas where we will continue to grow our selection Swiggy said. Experts point out that these are all attempts to make most of existing users as acquiring new customers is even more expensive in a tough funding environment. Growing the market is not just about new users but also increasing the use cases for existing users Swiggy said in a statement. Dutchlisted consumer internet investment firm Prosus which is the largest investor in Swiggy said in a recent filing that its share of Swiggys trading loss increased to 105 million from 34 million driven by investments to increase growth in both the core food delivery business and in Instamart. This would translate to a burn of over 300 million for the six months ended September 2022 or about over 50 million per month. Swiggy is also making changes to its loyalty programme Swiggy One increasing the minimum order size for free delivery from Rs 99 to a higher amount the source quoted above said. Swiggy did not respond to a specific query. The minimum order value for free delivery was Rs 101 in Chennai as of Monday. Blinkit recorded a gross merchandise value GMV of 270 million from January to July 2022 according to a research note published by investment banking firm Jefferies on November 24. Jefferies said Swiggys losses during the JanuaryJune period were much higher at over 315 million compared to approximately 50 million in losses for Zomato on a standalone basis and nearly 170 million inclusive of losses at Blinkit.

Exclusive: Dunzo likely to raise $100 million via convertible notes amid tough equity funding market,Reliance-backed co latest to tap alternative routes to secure funds. The round is in advanced stages of closure and could finally settle in the range of $70-100 million.,2023-01-06T00:30:00Z,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/dunzo-eyes-up-to-100-million-funding-via-convertible-notes-amid-tough-equity-funding-market/articleshow/96772938.cms,The round is in advanced stages of closure and could finally settle in the range of 70100 million the people said. The Bengalurubased startup was initially looking to raise at least 150 million by selling a stake but its decision to opt for convertible notes underscores the ongoing funding winter for large startups which need capital to sustain their businesses. It will settle closer to 100 million but definitely not anywhere closer to 150 million said one of the people familiar with the discussions. Raising funds through convertible notes a popular instrument now among growth to latestage startups will allow Dunzo to not ascribe itself a valuation immediately when investors are being cautious. The quickcommerce model where platforms promise grocery delivery within 1530 minutes has seen a sharp reversal of sentiment from investors in India and globally amid the liquidity squeeze. Also read ETtech Long Read Quick commerce may find it tough to bag new users investors in 2023 For Dunzo which was last valued at around 775 million in January 2022 its largest investor Reliance Retail is likely to cut a relatively smaller cheque in this round than last time people briefed on the matter said. Discover the stories of your interest The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ADIA is among new investors who are likely to join this round. The sovereign wealth fund is an investor in Reliances Jio Platforms. Sources said Dunzo had held talks also with Singapores Temasek as well but those seem to have fallen through. Most latestage startups are raising capital through instruments that dont impact their valuation amid a tightening funding environment said the person quoted earlier. They Dunzo are still trying to bring one or two more external investors to join the round. The due diligence has also now closed for this round which was done by one of the Big Four accounting firms another person said. Dunzo chief executive Kabeer Biswas and a spokesperson for ADIA declined to comment. Emails sent to Reliance Retail and Temasek didnt elicit any response till press time Thursday. Reliance Retail owns 25. 8 in Dunzo. Google is another major investor with a stake of just under 20. Venture funding for startups in 2022 fell around 30 to nearly 24 billion according to data from industry tracker Venture Intelligence. Nearly 64 of the respondents to ETs State of Startups survey as reported on December 30 had said they expected an improvement in funding scenario only by the second half of 2023 while more than 21 said it could even get worse in 2023 compared with the year before. Quick cost optimisations Dunzo has been trying to optimise costs internally at its quickservice business similar to rivals like Swiggys Instamart Zepto Zomatoowned Blinkit and BigBaskets BB Now. Among the quick commerce players BB Now a late entrant is the only player expanding aggressively on the back of new funding from parent Tata Digital and other investors. ET reported on Wednesday about the challenges 30minute delivery platforms are facing to scale their ventures while trying to arrest rising spending and discounting. Dunzo has made changes to its cost structure since it splurged more than Rs 100 crore per month for promotions during the Indian Premier League last year. Among other changes it was pushing for batching of orders and incentivising users to go for 60minute delivery slots. The company also has a pickupanddrop service for goods as well as a marketplace business to deliver groceries medicine meat and others. It had ventured into food delivery as well but phased it out gradually last year. Besides Dunzo Y Combinatorbacked Zepto is the other major standalone quick commerce player as Instamart is part of Swiggy while Blinkit and BB Now are being funded by parent firms Zomato and Tata Digital respectively. Zepto last raised 200 million in May 2022. Creativity in funding Dunzo is among the latest of Indian startups to have opted for funding through convertible notes. Businesstobusiness ecommerce startup Udaan had raised close to 400 million in convertible notes and debt in 2022 while PharmEasy and others had also opted for capital via this route. Many startups raise debt to fund daily operations. In convertible notes it is linked to a future funding or liquidity event like an IPO where the incoming investors now will get a discount on pricing compared to others. Dunzo had taken 6 million in debt from Blacksoil in November. At the time of the Reliance Retail investment Dunzos Biswas had said the company was planning to go for an IPO by 2025. The debt from Blacksoil was largely a shortterm capital arrangement while the ongoing round is being closed one of the people briefed on the matter said.

"BigBasket raises $200 million from Tata Digital, others","CEO Hari Menon outlines quick commerce expansion, bringing 1mg on its app . The funding takes e-grocer’s valuation to $3.2 billion.",2022-12-21T00:30:00Z,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/bigbasket-raises-200-million-from-tata-digital-others/articleshow/96384983.cms,In addition to Tata Digital which owns 64 in the Bengalurubased company other investors in the firm have also participated in the funding round. The companys valuation has now increased by 60 compared to the last primary cash infusion. Mirae Asset UKs CDC are among other investors in BigBasket parent Supermarket Grocery Supplies. Cofounder and CEO Hari Menon said the fresh capital will be used to strengthen infrastructure and ramp up marketing for expansion of the core grocery business. It will also invest further in its quick commerce product BB Now having entered the space relatively late. ET was the first to report in the September 27 edition that the egrocer was looking to raise 200 million and would be valued in the range of 33. 5 billion postmoney. In a secondary share sale in March it was valued at 2. 7 billion. Menon pointed out that quick commerce cant be a standalone business for a grocery firm as its a tricky business to make money in due to its lower average order value. At BB Now the average order value is about Rs 460 similar to the industry average. In the past year the quick commerce space had seen a funding frenzy that has tapered amid an industry wide slowdown in startup funding. BigBasket plans to take the main egrocery business to about 75 cities up from the current count of 55 cities. It plans to also move other services like the subscriptionbased BB Daily onto its main app along with Tata Digitals epharmacy offering 1mg. These changes and the expansion will begin in the new year. Menon said the standalone core grocery business is expected to hit operating profitability by the third quarter of next financial year. It is estimated to close the ongoing financial year with gross sales of 1. 5 billion with a target to reach about 2 billion in gross sales in the next year. The Bengalurubased firms latest funding also comes when there is a serious slowdown in latestage funding. In September a Tata Digitalled funding round had raised the valuation of the groups epharmacy portal 1mg to over 1 billion turning it into a unicorn. Quick delivery expansion While BigBasket can service about 80 of its existing users through BB Now the company plans to allocate about 4050 million for the business going forward. First thing is we are going to invest in BB Now which means we will look at a hundred more stores dark stores to cover all BigBasket customers. By JanuaryFebruary we would have covered 100 of BigBasket customers Menon said. There is significant expansion underway in the tier 2 markets where the company will aim to deliver in 3045 minutes. As adding more stores in areas without sufficient density may not make sense he added. Currently BB Now is clocking gross sales of about Rs 130 crore a month with a target to take this to about Rs 320 crore by December 2023. It is present in 24 cities currently that are serviced through dark stores small warehouses in central locations in a city to service orders in nearby locations in quick time. BB Now competes with Swiggy Instamart I am quite certain about it break up of quick commerce on how it will settle among users and 70 will still be core BigBasket services while the rest will be from quick commerce and subscription services like BB Daily he said. With expansion in place Menon said he is hoping BB Now will also become an acquisition tool for core BigBasket users as opposed to the grocery service converting existing users to try the 30 minutes delivery service. We will do a lot of crossselling he said. ET reported on December 20 saying Instamart and Zepto are incentivising users to increase their order size to above Rs 1000 while Dunzo is pushing longer delivery timelines like an hour for Dunzo Daily. The moment you try to increase your average order value your picking time goes up and the quantity a bike can carry is also restricted. The purpose people use quick commerce is because of speed Menon noted. Gross margin is also very critical and you should earn at least 4 in delivery around Rs 18 on Rs 400 order he said. Reshuffle in Super App BigBasket has also been bringing its key services on its main app internally referred to as its own super app. BigBasket and BB Now are listed on Tata Neu as part of the muchhyped super app. Menon said bringing pharmacy to its main app was always the plan including before the Tata deal happened. Pharma is very adjacent to grocery worldwide. If you see a grocery store they will typically have a pharmacy attached to it. We always wanted to bring in pharma even before the Tata deal. With the Tata deal done it was a nobrainer. It will flow straight into 1mg just like Tata Neu he said. While 1mg is expected to onboard the grocery app next month its subscription service BB Daily is also expected to come on the app in coming weeks. BB Daily is largely for morning essentials like bread milk eggs and other items. Within the broader segments of online grocery and personal care segments like meat beauty have been given doors on the main app. This door essentially creates a gateway for consumers to go directly to these sections while coming to the main grocery app. We are going to bring in some more categories as pull outs though we are yet to decide which one. We saw beauty and meat did well but it wont work for just fruits and vegetables. So we are seeing if more can be done and it would be in the section more in the app he said. The company is also expanding its offline Fresho Stores from 25 stores to 100 stores. It opened its first Fresho store in Bengaluru last November. These stores are also running experiments as Bengaluru outlets sell fruits and vegetables while other FMCG products can be ordered on the app and picked up from the store. In Hyderabad however both fresh produce and FMCG items can be bought through the stores and in Kolkata even meat can be bought from the Fresho outlet.
